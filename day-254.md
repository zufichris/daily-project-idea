# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning. The goal is to build a functional AI opponent that learns optimal strategies within a short timeframe, demonstrating the power of reinforcement learning in a constrained environment.  This allows for a tangible demonstration of AI learning capabilities within a daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar like RLlib)
- **Game Engine (Optional):** Pygame (for visualization, not strictly required for core functionality)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Logic Implementation:**  Implement the core game rules (e.g., winning conditions, valid moves) for the chosen game.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Create an agent using Q-learning or another suitable algorithm from Stable Baselines3.
- **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop that allows the agent to play against itself, learning optimal strategies through experience.
- **Evaluation:** Implement a method to evaluate the agent's performance (e.g., win rate against a random player).
- **Basic Logging:** Track key metrics during training (e.g., rewards, losses).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame to visualize the game and the agent's learning process.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):** Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the agent's learning speed and performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Implement the game logic and basic player (human or random) interaction.
2. **Agent Initialization:** Initialize the reinforcement learning agent using Stable Baselines3, defining the environment (state space, action space, reward function).
3. **Training:** Run the training loop, letting the agent play numerous games against itself.  Monitor progress through logging.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent against a random or human player to assess performance.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** Based on evaluation, adjust hyperparameters or training settings for improved results.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal play is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function might lead to suboptimal strategies.
- **Computational Resources:** Training a reinforcement learning agent can be computationally intensive.  Adjusting the training parameters (number of episodes, etc.) might be necessary to fit within the daily timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:** This project reinforces understanding of fundamental reinforcement learning concepts like Q-learning, state-action spaces, and reward functions.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Gain hands-on experience utilizing a powerful reinforcement learning library like Stable Baselines3, streamlining the development process and enabling rapid prototyping.
