# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robotic Manipulation

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple AI-powered system that generates descriptive captions for images captured by a robot's camera, aiding in robotic manipulation tasks.  The system will take an image as input and produce a caption describing the objects present, their locations, and potential actions. This is crucial for robots operating in unstructured environments, enabling more autonomous decision-making.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) for image processing
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning model (pre-trained model preferred)
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy for natural language processing
- A simulated robot environment (e.g., Gazebo, PyBullet) or a physical robot (optional, increases complexity)


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition:** Capture an image from a simulated or real robot's camera.
- **Object Detection:** Detect and classify objects within the image using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN).
- **Caption Generation:** Generate a descriptive caption based on the detected objects and their locations.
- **Output:** Display the image and generated caption.
- **Data Logging:**  (Optional) Log images and generated captions for future analysis and model improvement.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries and set up a simulated robot environment or connect to a physical robot.
2. **Image Processing:**  Load a sample image (or capture from the robot) and pre-process it for object detection (resizing, normalization).
3. **Object Detection & Classification:** Use a pre-trained object detection model to detect and classify objects, obtaining bounding boxes and class labels.
4. **Caption Generation:**  Use a simple sequence-to-sequence model or template-based approach to generate a caption describing the detected objects, their positions (e.g., "a red ball is located on the table"), and potential actions.
5. **Output & Visualization:** Display the image with bounding boxes and the generated caption.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model for object detection and caption generation that balances accuracy and speed is crucial. Experimentation might be necessary.
- **Caption Quality:**  Generating accurate and grammatically correct captions can be challenging.  Focus on a simple, functional approach initially; refinements can be done later.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of pre-trained deep learning models for computer vision tasks.
- Experience in integrating different AI components (object detection, NLP) for a combined task.
