# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice and Gesture

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and integrating readily available APIs and libraries. This demonstrates a practical application of multi-modal input in a smart home environment.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyAudio (audio input), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), OpenCV (computer vision for gesture recognition), RPi.GPIO (for GPIO control of appliance - if using a Raspberry Pi), or relevant libraries for other platforms.
- **Hardware (Optional):**  Raspberry Pi (or similar microcontroller), a smart lamp/fan, a webcam.  Could be simulated without hardware.
- **API:**  A cloud-based speech recognition API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) might be used instead of offline libraries for increased accuracy.  Similarly, a gesture recognition API might improve accuracy for complex gesture recognition.


## Features & Requirements
- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Set lamp brightness to 50%".
- **Gesture Control:** The system should recognize predefined gestures (e.g., wave hand to turn on/off, hand raise to increase brightness, hand lower to decrease brightness).
- **Appliance Control:**  The system must reliably control the state (on/off) and, optionally, the brightness/speed of a connected smart appliance.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle invalid commands and unsuccessful gesture recognition.
- **Simple UI (Optional):** A minimal UI to display current appliance status.

- **Advanced Features:**
    -  Multiple appliance support
    -  Integration with a home automation platform (e.g., Home Assistant).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the hardware (if used). Connect to cloud APIs if required.
2. **Voice Control Implementation:** Integrate speech-to-text functionality and create a mapping between voice commands and appliance control actions.  Test thoroughly.
3. **Gesture Recognition Implementation:**  Implement basic gesture recognition using OpenCV.  Train the model on a small dataset of hand gestures (e.g., images/videos of your hand movements).  Test thoroughly.
4. **Appliance Control Integration:**  Establish communication with the smart appliance (e.g., via GPIO pins if using a Raspberry Pi, or API if using a cloud based smart home platform). Test the integration of voice and gesture control.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test all features and make necessary adjustments for robustness and accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Real-time gesture recognition can be inaccurate due to lighting conditions, background noise, or variations in hand position.  This can be mitigated through careful image preprocessing and robust machine learning techniques, though a simpler approach will be taken for the daily challenge.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** Ensuring the compatibility between the chosen hardware components and the software libraries might require troubleshooting.  Using simulated hardware initially avoids this.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of skills in real-time audio and video processing.
- Practical experience in integrating multiple input modalities (voice and gesture) into a single application.
