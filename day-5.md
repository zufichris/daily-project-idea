# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic prototype of a micro-gesture recognition system for controlling smart home devices using a computer vision library.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, wave) from a webcam feed to trigger pre-defined actions like turning lights on/off or adjusting volume.  This provides a practical application of computer vision while remaining achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Library: OpenCV (cv2)
- Framework:  None (script-based)
- Tools:  Webcam, potentially a pre-trained hand detection model (e.g., MediaPipe).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  The system should process the webcam feed in real-time and detect predefined gestures.
- **Action Triggering:** Detected gestures should trigger specific actions (e.g., "thumbs up" = turn lights on).
- **Gesture Training (Optional):**  Allow for simple training of new gestures.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.
- **UI (Optional):**  A simple display showing detected gestures and device status.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install OpenCV, test webcam connection, and potentially download a pre-trained hand detection model.
2. **Gesture Recognition Algorithm:** Implement a simple gesture recognition algorithm using OpenCV's features for image processing and feature extraction (e.g., contour detection, simple shape matching).  Focus on a small set of distinct gestures.
3. **Action Mapping:** Define the mapping between recognized gestures and smart home device control actions (e.g., using simulated actions or a simple API for testing).
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly with different lighting conditions and hand positions. Refine the algorithm based on observed errors.
5. **Optional UI Development:** (If time permits) Create a basic GUI to display the detected gestures and device status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to Noise and Variations:**  Hand gestures can be inconsistent due to lighting, background clutter, and variations in hand shape and size.  Addressing this requires careful algorithm design and potentially the use of more advanced techniques like background subtraction.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing the webcam feed in real-time can be computationally intensive.  Optimizing the algorithm for speed is crucial to ensure smooth operation.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of computer vision techniques for real-time object detection and recognition.
- Experience with OpenCV library for image processing and manipulation.
- Understanding of the challenges associated with building robust real-time systems.
