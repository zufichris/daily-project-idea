# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project focuses on building a system that enables a robotic arm to detect and track a specific object in real-time using a camera feed. This is a fundamental task in robotics, applicable to various scenarios like automated pick-and-place operations, warehouse automation, or even assistive robotics.  The daily challenge will be to get a basic prototype functioning, capable of detecting and following a pre-defined object.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for object detection model), Robot Operating System (ROS) - if using a ROS-compatible robotic arm.  If not using a ROS-compatible arm, a suitable library for your specific arm's communication protocol.
- **Hardware:** Webcam or similar camera, a robotic arm (optional, but highly recommended for a full experience), a computer with sufficient processing power.
- **Object Detection Model:** Pre-trained models like YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet, or a custom-trained model (for advanced users).


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  The system must accurately detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball, a specific toy) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Once detected, the system should continuously track the object's movement.
- **Position Reporting:** The system should report the object's (x, y) coordinates in the camera frame.
- **Arm Control (Optional):** If using a robotic arm, the system should translate the object's coordinates into arm movements, allowing the arm to follow or point towards the object.
- **User Interface:**  A basic display showing the detected object and its tracked position.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, ROS if applicable). Download and prepare a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Object Detection Integration:** Integrate the chosen object detection model with OpenCV to process the camera feed and detect the target object.
3. **Object Tracking Implementation:** Implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's tracking APIs or a Kalman filter) to maintain the object's location frame-by-frame.
4. **Position Reporting & Visualization:** Display the object's position (x,y) coordinates on the screen and log them for analysis.
5. **Robotic Arm Control (Optional):**  If using a robotic arm, implement the necessary code to translate the object's coordinates into arm control commands. This step requires familiarity with the robotic arm's API or ROS.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time object detection and tracking can be computationally expensive. Optimizing the model and code for speed is crucial. Consider using lighter-weight object detection models like MobileNet.
- **Occlusion Handling:** The system should be robust to temporary occlusions.  Advanced tracking algorithms can handle short periods of lost detection, but fully robust occlusion handling is beyond a two-day scope.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides practical experience with object detection, tracking, and image processing using OpenCV.
- **Application of Deep Learning in Robotics:**  It demonstrates how to integrate a deep learning model with robotic control for real-world applications.
