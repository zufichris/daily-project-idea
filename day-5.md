# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a lightweight AI model capable of generating concise and informative captions for images captured by a robot's onboard camera. This captioning system could assist in robot navigation, object recognition, and autonomous decision-making by providing textual context to visual data.  The focus will be on a simplified, fast model suitable for real-time processing on resource-constrained robotic platforms.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow Lite (for model inference), OpenCV (for image processing), NLTK (for natural language processing â€“ optional for more sophisticated captions).
- **Model:** A pre-trained mobile-friendly image captioning model (e.g., a smaller version of a model like Show, Attend, and Tell or similar).  Alternatively, fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a small dataset can be considered if time permits.
- **Hardware:**  A Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer (optional, for testing on a robotic platform simulation).

## Features & Requirements

- **Image Input:** The system should accept a single image as input (e.g., from a file or simulated camera feed).
- **Caption Generation:**  The AI model should generate a short, descriptive caption for the input image (e.g., "Red ball on a blue table").
- **Output Display:** The generated caption should be displayed on the console or a simple GUI.
- **Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle cases where the image is not processed correctly or the caption generation fails.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Basic timing metrics should be recorded to assess the processing speed.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Integration with a robotic simulation environment (ROS, Gazebo) to test captioning in a simulated navigation scenario.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implementation of a simple feedback loop, where the robot can request clarification on ambiguous captions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained mobile-friendly image captioning model.
2. **Image Preprocessing:**  Write a function to load and preprocess images for the chosen model (resizing, normalization).
3. **Caption Generation:** Integrate the pre-trained model to generate captions from preprocessed images.
4. **Output & Display:** Implement a function to display the generated caption (console or GUI).
5. **Testing & Evaluation:** Test the system with various images and evaluate the accuracy and speed of caption generation.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model that balances accuracy and speed for real-time processing can be challenging.  Experimentation may be needed.
- **Resource Constraints:** If deploying on a resource-constrained device, optimizing the model and code for efficiency is crucial.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Deep Learning Model Application:** This project reinforces practical application and deployment of pre-trained deep learning models for real-world tasks.
- **Embedded System Integration:** (Optional, if using a robot simulator) It provides experience integrating AI models into resource-constrained embedded systems, vital for robotics applications.
