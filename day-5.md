# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to build a functional AI opponent within a short timeframe, showcasing the power of reinforcement learning for game AI development.  This is a great exercise in understanding the fundamentals of RL without getting bogged down in complex environments.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Libraries:  `gym` (for environment creation, optional), `numpy`, `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (for reinforcement learning implementation), `matplotlib` (for visualization, optional)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -   A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -   An AI agent using a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
    -   Ability to train the AI agent against a random opponent.
    -   Basic performance metrics (e.g., win rate against random opponent).
    -   Ability to play against the trained AI agent.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -   Implementation of an ε-greedy exploration strategy.
    -   Visualization of the Q-table or policy.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game's rules and state representation. Use `gym` for a structured environment or create a custom class.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning or SARSA) and implement the agent's learning logic.
3. **Training:** Train the agent against a random opponent for a fixed number of episodes.  Monitor performance.
4. **Testing:**  Play against the trained agent to evaluate its performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Visualize the learning process (e.g., win rate over time, Q-table values).


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:** Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions during training is crucial for optimal performance.  Experiment with different ε values.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate are crucial hyperparameters that may require tuning for optimal performance. This might require iterative adjustments during the day.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: This project provides hands-on experience with Q-learning or SARSA, key algorithms in reinforcement learning.
- Agent-Environment Interaction:  Understanding the interaction between an agent and its environment is crucial for building successful AI systems. This project provides practical experience with this concept.
