# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a micro-gesture recognition system that can control smart home devices using subtle hand movements detected by a webcam.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the feasibility of such a system within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in exploring alternative, intuitive interfaces for smart home technology beyond voice or touch controls.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model optimization and deployment)
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code), potentially a Raspberry Pi for deployment (optional).

## Features & Requirements

- **Hand Detection & Tracking:**  Accurately detect and track a user's hand in real-time using the webcam.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize a small set of predefined micro-gestures (e.g., thumb up/down for light on/off, finger count for volume control).
- **Device Control:**  Interface with a simulated smart home environment (e.g., using a simple API or mock data) to trigger actions based on recognized gestures.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual feedback (on screen) to the user indicating recognized gestures.
- **Calibration:** Allow for basic calibration to account for variations in lighting and hand size.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a simple machine learning model (e.g., using a pre-trained model or a very simple custom model) for improved gesture recognition accuracy.
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a real smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant) for actual device control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Hand Tracking:**  Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and implement hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe.  Focus on a single hand for simplicity.
2. **Gesture Definition & Recognition:** Define a small set of simple micro-gestures (2-3 initially). Implement basic logic to recognize these gestures based on hand landmark positions provided by MediaPipe.
3. **Device Control Simulation:** Create a mock smart home environment (using Python dictionaries or a simple API) to simulate device control based on recognized gestures.
4. **Real-time Feedback Integration:**  Display recognized gestures and their corresponding simulated actions on the screen.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different users and lighting conditions.  Refine gesture definitions and recognition logic as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with simple, real-time gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in hand position, lighting, and background noise.  Focus on robust feature extraction and simple gesture definitions to mitigate this.
- **Computational Resources:**  Real-time processing of video data can be computationally intensive. Optimize code for speed and consider using a more powerful machine if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:**  This project provides hands-on experience with real-time image processing, hand tracking, and feature extraction.
- **Develop proficiency in integrating multiple libraries:**  The project requires coordinating different libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe) to achieve the desired functionality, improving software integration skills.
