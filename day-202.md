# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control via Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic self-balancing robotic arm control system using reinforcement learning (RL).  The goal is to create a simple robotic arm simulation that learns to balance itself using a Q-learning algorithm.  This project showcases a practical application of RL in a simplified robotic context, offering a valuable learning experience within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for simulation visualization), NumPy (for numerical computations), and a RL library such as `gym` or a custom implementation of Q-learning.
- **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple 2D Robotic Arm Simulation:** A simulated robotic arm with one joint and a weight at the end.
- **Balancing Act:** The RL agent learns to apply torque to the joint to keep the arm balanced against gravity.
- **Reward System:** A reward function that encourages the agent to maintain a balanced position.
- **Q-Learning Implementation:** A basic Q-learning algorithm to train the agent.
- **Data Visualization:** Display the arm's position and the learning progress.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporate noise into the simulation to make the balancing task more challenging.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., SARSA).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Simulation Environment:** Create a simple 2D simulation using Pygame, representing the robotic arm and its joint.
2. **Implement the Q-Learning Algorithm:** Design the state space (angle and angular velocity), action space (torque values), and reward function.  Implement the Q-learning update rule.
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the simulation and let the RL agent learn to balance the arm through numerous trials.
4. **Visualize the Results:** Display the arm's movement and the learning curve (e.g., average reward over time).
5. **Evaluate Performance:** Assess the agent's ability to maintain balance after training.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Choosing an appropriate reward function that effectively guides the learning process can be challenging.  Experimentation with different reward structures may be necessary.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding optimal values for learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate in the Q-learning algorithm can require iterative adjustments.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project provides practical experience with the Q-learning algorithm and its application in a control problem.
- **Robotics Simulation:** Gain familiarity with building simple robotic simulations and integrating them with RL algorithms.
