# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Webcam

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed. The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's view, providing its coordinates and classification. This project serves as a practical demonstration of computer vision techniques and their application in robotics or automated systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (for optional advanced classification), NumPy
* **Tools:**  A webcam (or pre-recorded video), a Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time video capture:** Capture video frames from a webcam.
- **Object detection:** Identify a pre-defined object (e.g., color, shape) within each frame.
- **Object tracking:** Track the identified object's movement across frames using a suitable tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter).
- **Coordinate reporting:** Display the object's (centroid) x and y coordinates on the video stream in real-time.
- **Basic visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes or markers around the tracked object.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Object classification using a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model (requires pre-training or using a readily available model).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Integration with a robotic arm control interface (requires additional hardware and libraries).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Video Capture:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and establish a connection to the webcam using OpenCV. Capture frames continuously.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm to identify the target object (e.g., thresholding based on HSV color space).  Alternatively, use a simpler shape detection (e.g., circular objects).
3. **Object Tracking:** Employ a tracking algorithm (e.g., a simple centroid tracker or Kalman filter) to maintain the object's position across frames.
4. **Coordinate Display and Visualization:** Display the object's coordinates and draw bounding boxes or markers on the video stream using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **(Optional) Classification and Control:** Integrate a pre-trained classification model if chosen, and implement robotic arm control commands (if the advanced feature is selected).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Object Detection:** Dealing with variations in lighting, background clutter, and object occlusion can be challenging. Consider using more sophisticated object detection algorithms if the simple method proves insufficient.
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms and potentially optimization techniques to maintain a consistent frame rate.  Pre-processing steps can reduce computational load.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of computer vision concepts:**  Develop a deeper understanding of color-based object detection, tracking algorithms, and image processing techniques.
- **Practical application of OpenCV:** Gain hands-on experience utilizing OpenCV's functionalities for video processing, object detection, and visualization.
