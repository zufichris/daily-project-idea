# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and implement a rudimentary AI agent that learns to play it using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The focus will be on a quick prototype demonstrating fundamental RL concepts, rather than a polished, complex game.  This allows for significant progress within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (for RL implementation), NumPy (for numerical computations)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Engine:** A simple 2D game (e.g., a maze navigation, a simple platformer).
- **Agent Representation:**  A basic AI agent represented by a neural network.
- **RL Algorithm:** A simple RL algorithm like Q-learning or SARSA.
- **Training Loop:**  Implementation of a training loop that allows the agent to learn through trial and error.
- **Visualization:** Basic visualization of the game and the agent's performance.


- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement a slightly more sophisticated RL algorithm like Deep Q-Network (DQN) if time permits.
- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement a simple reward shaping mechanism to guide the agentâ€™s learning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Design and implement a minimal 2D game using Pygame.  Focus on simple mechanics and clear state representation.
2. **Agent Design:**  Create a neural network agent with appropriate input and output layers for the chosen game.
3. **RL Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning or SARSA initially).
4. **Training Loop Setup:** Develop a training loop that runs the game, allows the agent to interact with the environment, and updates the agent's policy based on the chosen RL algorithm.
5. **Visualization & Evaluation:** Implement basic visualization of the game and track the agent's progress (e.g., reward over time).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can hinder learning. Careful consideration is required to create a reward function that guides the agent towards desired behavior.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** RL algorithms often require careful tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.).  Experimentation and potentially some automated hyperparameter optimization might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain hands-on experience with core RL concepts like state, action, reward, policy, and value functions.
- **Neural Network Implementation:** Practical application of neural networks for solving a control problem.
