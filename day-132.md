# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple but functional real-time object detection and tracking system using a web browser and WebRTC.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in a video stream from a webcam, track its movement, and display the results overlaid on the video feed. This showcases the integration of computer vision and real-time communication technologies.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js for server-side optional enhancements)
- **Frontend Framework:**  React or Vue.js (optional, but highly recommended for efficient UI development)
- **Computer Vision Library:** TensorFlow.js or similar lightweight JavaScript library for object detection (e.g., MobileNet SSD).
- **WebRTC Library:** Simple-peer or similar library for peer-to-peer video streaming (optional for remote collaboration).
- **Tools:**  VS Code or similar IDE, npm or yarn for package management.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Capture and display a live video stream from the user's webcam.
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the video stream using a pre-trained model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across consecutive frames.  Display bounding boxes around the detected object.
- **Performance Monitoring:**  Display FPS (frames per second) to measure the system's performance.
- **Visual Feedback:** Overlay bounding boxes and tracking information on the live video feed.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement server-side processing using Node.js to allow multiple clients to share the same object detection results (optional).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add user interface elements to allow selecting different detection models or objects.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Set up a development environment with necessary tools and install required libraries (TensorFlow.js, a frontend framework if chosen, and any WebRTC library if needed).
2. **Webcam Integration:** Integrate a webcam feed into the application using the browser's MediaDevices API. Display the feed in the UI.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Load a pre-trained object detection model using TensorFlow.js and implement object tracking using bounding boxes and potentially a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking). Overlay the results on the video feed.
4. **Performance Measurement:**  Implement FPS monitoring to assess the system's performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
5. **UI Refinements:** Improve the user interface with clear visual feedback and potentially add settings for the object detection model or other parameters.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Performance:** Real-time object detection can be computationally intensive.  Choosing a lightweight model and optimizing code are crucial for achieving acceptable performance.
- **Accuracy:**  The accuracy of object detection depends on the chosen model and the quality of the video stream. Pre-trained models may need adjustments for optimal performance with the specific object being targeted.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision concepts:** Gain practical experience with object detection and tracking using TensorFlow.js or a similar library.
- **Experience with Real-time Web Applications:** Build practical experience with handling real-time video streams and integrating them into web applications using WebRTC (optional).
