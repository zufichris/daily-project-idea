# Minimalist Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a minimalist inverse kinematics (IK) solver for a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).  The solver will take a desired end-effector position as input and calculate the corresponding joint angles.  This is a fundamental problem in robotics, and a simplified implementation allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different IK algorithms. The significance lies in understanding the core concepts of robotic manipulation and applying them practically.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), SciPy (optional, for optimization algorithms)
- **IDE:**  VS Code, PyCharm, or any preferred Python IDE.


## Features & Requirements

- **Forward Kinematics:** Implement forward kinematics to calculate the end-effector position given joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics Solver (Closed-form solution):** Develop a closed-form IK solution for a 3-DOF planar robotic arm.  This avoids iterative methods, keeping the implementation concise.
- **User Input:** Allow users to specify the desired (x, y) coordinates of the end-effector.
- **Output:** Display the calculated joint angles.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  A simple graphical representation of the arm and its movement.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Robot Model:** Establish the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters or a geometrical model for the 3-DOF planar robotic arm.
2. **Implement Forward Kinematics:** Write a function that calculates the end-effector position given the joint angles using the defined robot model.
3. **Develop Closed-form IK Solver:**  Derive and implement the closed-form solution for the inverse kinematics problem. This will involve trigonometric manipulation to solve for the joint angles.
4. **User Interface:** Create a simple text-based interface allowing users to input the desired (x, y) coordinates.
5. **Output and Validation:** Display the calculated joint angles.  Validate the results by comparing the end-effector position obtained using forward kinematics with the user-specified input.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Singularities:**  Understanding and handling potential singularities in the IK solution, where multiple solutions exist or no solution exists for certain configurations.  Error handling should be included to gracefully manage these cases.
- **Accuracy:** Achieving sufficient accuracy in the calculated joint angles, potentially requiring careful consideration of floating-point precision.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Inverse Kinematics:** This project provides practical experience in deriving and implementing IK solutions, a crucial concept in robotics.
- **Understanding of Robot Modeling:** It solidifies the understanding of robot kinematics and the representation of robot geometry using methods such as DH parameters.
