# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview
This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection using intelligent control algorithms to optimize traffic flow. The simulation will focus on a single intersection with multiple lanes and traffic signals, allowing for experimentation with different control strategies to minimize wait times and improve overall efficiency. This is a valuable learning exercise showcasing real-world applications of algorithms and data structures.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `pygame` (for visualization), `numpy` (for numerical computation), `random` (for traffic generation)
- **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements
- **Traffic Generation:** Simulate vehicles arriving at the intersection randomly with varying speeds and lane choices.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light controller (e.g., fixed-time or basic actuated control).
- **Visualization:** Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic signals graphically using `pygame`.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display key metrics like average wait time and throughput.
- **Vehicle Movement:**  Accurate simulation of vehicle movement through the intersection, respecting traffic laws.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., adaptive control based on queue length).
- **Optional Feature:**  Add pedestrian crossings and pedestrian traffic simulation.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Basic Setup:**  Create the intersection structure using `pygame`, define vehicle and traffic light classes, and implement basic vehicle generation.
2. **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple fixed-time traffic light controller.
3. **Vehicle Movement & Collision Detection:**  Develop logic for vehicle movement within the intersection, ensuring they stop at red lights and avoid collisions.
4. **Performance Measurement:** Integrate code to track and display average wait time and throughput.
5. **Visualization Enhancement:** Refine the visualization to improve clarity and readability (e.g., add vehicle labels, speed indicators).


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Collision Detection:**  Efficiently implementing collision detection between vehicles and traffic lights can be challenging. Consider using bounding boxes for simplification.
- **Algorithm Optimization:**  Finding the optimal balance between simplicity and accuracy in the traffic light control algorithm requires careful consideration.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Algorithm Design & Implementation:**  Practice designing and implementing control algorithms and data structures (queues, etc.).
- **Software Engineering Principles:** Refine skills in modular design, code readability, and efficient implementation.
