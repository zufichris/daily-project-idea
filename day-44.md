# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Robotic Arm Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a robotic arm using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will utilize machine learning to recognize these micro-gestures, translating them into specific robotic arm movements. This project is significant as it explores a more intuitive and natural human-robot interaction method, potentially applicable in assistive robotics and industrial automation.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/Keras (machine learning), PySerial (for serial communication with robotic arm - if applicable)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, Robotic Arm (optional, can be simulated), Computer with sufficient processing power.

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Capture:** Capture a video stream from a webcam using OpenCV.
- **Gesture Preprocessing:**  Implement image processing techniques (e.g., background subtraction, hand segmentation) to isolate the hand gestures.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model on a small dataset of pre-recorded micro-gestures (e.g., slight finger movements representing commands like "up," "down," "left," "right").
- **Arm Control (Optional):** If a robotic arm is available, integrate the model's output to control the arm's movements via serial communication.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display the recognized gesture and corresponding arm action (if applicable) on the screen.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition:** Record a small dataset (around 50-100 samples per gesture) of micro-hand gestures using the webcam.
2. **Model Training:** Train a lightweight CNN model using the recorded data.  Focus on a simple architecture for quick training and inference.
3. **Gesture Processing Pipeline:** Integrate the trained model into a real-time pipeline using OpenCV to capture and process webcam feed.
4. **Control Integration (Optional):** If using a robotic arm, implement the serial communication to send commands based on the recognized gesture.
5. **User Interface:** Develop a basic GUI to display the recognized gesture and provide feedback.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Data Augmentation:** The limited dataset might lead to overfitting.  Implementing simple data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, scaling) can mitigate this.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing model accuracy and inference speed is crucial for real-time application.  Optimizing the model and/or using a more efficient inference engine might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces practical application of computer vision techniques using OpenCV.
- Provides hands-on experience in building and training a CNN model for a specific application.
