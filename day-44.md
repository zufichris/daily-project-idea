# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera and leveraging WebRTC for efficient streaming and communication.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and track its movement within the camera's field of view, displaying the results in a web browser.  This project explores the integration of computer vision with real-time communication technologies, useful in applications ranging from augmented reality to robotics.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for object detection), WebRTC (using a suitable library like aiortc), Flask (for a simple web server)
* **Tools:**  A web camera, a suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code), a web browser.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:**  The system should track the detected object's movement, providing its coordinates in the frame.
- **WebRTC Streaming:** The video stream, along with object detection data (bounding box coordinates), should be streamed to a web browser using WebRTC.
- **Web UI:** A simple web interface should display the live video stream with superimposed bounding boxes around the detected object.
- **FPS Display:** The system should display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Object Tracking:**  Extend the system to track multiple instances of the target object.
- **Object Classification:** Implement object classification to identify different objects instead of just a single predefined one.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, aiortc, Flask).
2. **Implement Object Detection and Tracking:** Use MediaPipe or a similar library for real-time object detection and tracking. Focus on getting accurate bounding boxes around the target object.
3. **WebRTC Integration:** Integrate WebRTC to stream the video frame with overlaid bounding boxes from the Python backend to a web browser.  This involves setting up a simple server using Flask and handling WebRTC peer connections.
4. **Develop the Web UI:** Create a simple HTML page to display the received video stream. Use JavaScript to render the bounding boxes received from the server.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system, focusing on the speed and accuracy of object detection and tracking. Optimize for smooth streaming performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:**  Balancing real-time processing with high frame rates can be challenging.  Consider using efficient algorithms and optimizing code for performance.
- **WebRTC Complexity:** Integrating WebRTC can be complex. Utilizing a well-documented library and focusing on a minimal viable product is key for a one-two day project.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience in building a real-time object detection and tracking system.
- **WebRTC Integration:** Learn how to use WebRTC for efficient real-time video streaming and data communication between a backend and a web browser.
