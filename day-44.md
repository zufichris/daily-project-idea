# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified traffic light simulation that utilizes a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize traffic flow.  The goal is not to build a full-fledged, city-wide simulator, but a small, contained intersection that demonstrates the principles of self-optimization through reinforcement learning. This will allow for rapid prototyping and experimentation within a one-to-two day timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar like RLlib)
- **Simulation Environment:** Pygame (for visualization - optional, but highly recommended for immediate feedback)
- **Other Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical operations)


## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Generation:**  Simulate vehicles arriving at the intersection with varying arrival rates and directions.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a traffic light system with adjustable cycle lengths and timings.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Train a reinforcement learning agent (e.g., using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)) to optimize traffic light timings based on the state of the intersection (number of vehicles waiting in each direction).
- **Performance Metrics:** Track metrics like average waiting time and throughput.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Use Pygame to visually represent the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light states.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Incorporate different vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks) with varying speeds and priorities.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a more complex intersection with multiple lanes and turning movements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Create the basic simulation environment (using Pygame if desired). Define the intersection geometry, vehicle generation parameters, and initial traffic light timings.
2. **Implement Traffic Light Control:** Create a simple traffic light controller with fixed timing cycles.
3. **Integrate RL Agent:**  Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO is a good starting point). Define the state space (e.g., number of vehicles waiting in each direction), action space (e.g., traffic light phase), and reward function (e.g., negative waiting time).
4. **Train the Agent:** Train the RL agent using the chosen algorithm. This may require adjusting hyperparameters for optimal performance within the time constraints.
5. **Evaluate Performance:** Measure the performance of the optimized traffic light system using the defined metrics.  Compare its performance to the initial fixed-timing system.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm might require experimentation and may consume significant time.  Start with reasonable defaults and focus on getting a functional system.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or unexpected behavior from the RL agent. Carefully consider what aspects of traffic flow to incentivize.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Implementation:**  Gain practical experience implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.
- **Simulation Design:** Develop skills in designing and implementing a simplified simulation environment.
