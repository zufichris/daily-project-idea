# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype of an AI-powered image caption generator specifically designed to assist robot navigation in unstructured environments.  The system will take an image from a robot's onboard camera as input and generate a concise, informative caption describing the scene's relevant features for navigation purposes (e.g., "Clear path ahead," "Obstacle: box on the left," "Stairs ahead"). This enhances robot autonomy by providing a human-interpretable summary of the visual input, facilitating debugging and potentially enabling higher-level control strategies.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (deep learning), transformers (NLP)
* **Pre-trained Models:** A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) and a pre-trained captioning model (e.g.,  from the Hugging Face model hub).
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation).


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition:**  The system should be able to capture images from a simulated camera feed or a real-world camera connected to the computer.
- **Object Detection:**  Accurately detect and classify key objects in the image (obstacles, pathways, landmarks).
- **Caption Generation:** Generate natural language captions summarizing the detected objects and their spatial relationships.
- **Output:** Display the image and the generated caption side-by-side.
- **Data Logging:** Optional - Save the input image and generated caption for future analysis and model improvement.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Incorporate spatial reasoning to include relative positions (e.g., "Box 2 meters ahead on the right").
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a simple confidence score for the caption to indicate the model's certainty.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained object detection and captioning model.
2. **Object Detection Pipeline:** Integrate the pre-trained object detection model to identify and classify objects in the input image.
3. **Caption Generation Pipeline:** Process the object detection results (bounding boxes, labels, confidence scores) to feed into the pre-trained captioning model.
4. **Integration and Testing:** Combine the object detection and captioning modules. Test with sample images and adjust parameters as needed.
5. **Output and Display:** Present the results (image and caption) in a user-friendly manner.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:**  Deep learning models can be computationally expensive.  Consider using a GPU if available to accelerate processing.
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of object detection and caption generation will depend on the quality of the pre-trained models and the diversity of the input images.  Choose models appropriate for the intended environment.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of deep learning pipelines:**  This project involves integrating multiple pre-trained models for a specific task, demonstrating a practical application of deep learning concepts.
- **Develop skills in integrating computer vision and natural language processing:**  The project bridges two significant areas of AI, highlighting the potential for synergistic applications in robotics.
