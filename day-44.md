# AI-Powered Real-time Object Tracking & Classification Prototype

## Overview
This project aims to build a prototype system capable of real-time object tracking and classification using a webcam feed and a pre-trained machine learning model. This demonstrates core concepts in computer vision and machine learning, suitable for rapid prototyping and showcasing skills in integrating different technologies.  The significance lies in its versatility; this foundation can be applied to various applications like security monitoring, robotics navigation, or automated quality control.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for model loading and inference), NumPy
- **Tools:**  Webcam (or video file), Jupyter Notebook (or IDE of choice)
- **Pre-trained Model:**  YOLOv5 (or a similar object detection model readily available)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Processing:**  Capture and process video frames from a webcam at a reasonable frame rate (e.g., 10-15 FPS).
- **Object Detection:**  Detect and locate objects within each frame using the pre-trained model.
- **Object Classification:**  Classify detected objects into predefined categories (e.g., person, car, bicycle).
- **Bounding Box Visualization:**  Overlay bounding boxes and class labels on the video feed to visualize detection results.
- **Basic Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using object ID's) to follow detected objects across frames.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a more sophisticated tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) for smoother object tracking.
- **Optional Feature:**  Add a user interface (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt) for adjusting parameters.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy) and download a pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
2. **Video Capture & Preprocessing:**  Write code to capture frames from the webcam and preprocess them (resize, normalization).
3. **Object Detection & Classification:** Load the pre-trained model and perform inference on each preprocessed frame to obtain detection results (bounding boxes, class labels, confidence scores).
4. **Visualization & Display:** Overlay the detection results (bounding boxes, labels) onto the original video frames and display the results in a window.
5. **Basic Tracking Implementation:** Assign unique IDs to detected objects and track them across frames using a simple method like comparing bounding box centroids.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially with complex models.  Consider using model optimization techniques or reducing frame resolution if necessary.
- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models might not perform perfectly on all objects and scenarios.  Evaluate the model's performance and consider retraining or fine-tuning if accuracy is insufficient.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce practical skills in integrating computer vision and machine learning libraries.** This project provides hands-on experience in using OpenCV for video processing and TensorFlow/PyTorch for model inference.
- **Gain experience with real-time application development.** Working with video streams requires efficient code and handling of computational constraints, reinforcing optimization techniques.
