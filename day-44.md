# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimal version of a classic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Nim) using reinforcement learning. The goal is to build a functional AI prototype within a day or two, demonstrating basic reinforcement learning concepts and showcasing the power of AI in simple game environments.  The project's significance lies in its ability to illustrate core RL principles in a concise, easily understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for reinforcement learning, NumPy for numerical computation.
- **IDE:**  PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  Implement a simple, text-based game environment (e.g., 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe).
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Develop a Q-learning or SARSA agent to learn optimal strategies.
- **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that allows the agent to play against itself and learn from its experiences.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Track and visualize the agent's performance (e.g., win rate) over time.
- **Basic GUI (Optional):**  A simple text-based or minimal graphical user interface to interact with the game and the AI.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):** Implement different exploration-exploitation strategies (e.g., ε-greedy, softmax) and compare their performance.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Integrate a different reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network – DQN, if time permits).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment:** Define the game rules and state representation. Implement functions for making moves, checking for wins/draws, and determining the next player.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity). Define the state-action space and implement the Q-table or neural network (for DQN).
3. **Training Loop:** Create a loop where the agent plays against itself repeatedly, updating its Q-values based on the rewards received.  Use a suitable reward function (e.g., +1 for win, -1 for loss, 0 for draw).
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Track the agent's win rate, average reward, or other relevant metrics over the training episodes and visualize the results using a simple plot.
5. **GUI (Optional):** If time allows, create a basic interface to interact with the game and observe the AI's moves.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal learning rate, discount factor, and exploration parameters might require experimentation.
- **Computational Cost:**  Deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN) can be computationally expensive, potentially limiting the complexity of the game environment for a one-day project.  For a quick prototype, simpler algorithms like Q-learning are preferred.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with core RL concepts like Q-learning, rewards, states, actions, and exploration-exploitation.
- **Python Programming and Libraries:**  Reinforce skills in Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
