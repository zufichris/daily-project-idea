# Minimalist Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a minimalist inverse kinematics (IK) solver for a 3-DOF robotic arm.  The solver will take a desired end-effector position as input and calculate the corresponding joint angles. This is a fundamental problem in robotics, and a streamlined solution can be valuable for rapid prototyping and educational purposes.  The focus is on a simple, efficient solution rather than a highly optimized or generalized one, making it achievable within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for visualization â€“ optional).
- **Optional:**  A robotics simulator (e.g., PyBullet, V-REP) for testing and visualization.

## Features & Requirements

- **3-DOF IK Solver:**  Calculate the joint angles for a 3-degree-of-freedom robotic arm given the desired x, y, and z coordinates of the end-effector.
- **Geometric Approach:** Utilize a geometric solution (e.g., trigonometry) rather than iterative methods like Jacobian IK for faster computation.
- **Input Validation:**  Handle invalid input coordinates (e.g., points outside the arm's reachable workspace).
- **Output Formatting:** Present the calculated joint angles in a clear and readable format.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Provide informative error messages for invalid inputs or calculation failures.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Implement a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt to allow for interactive input and visualization of the results.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Integrate with a robotics simulator to visualize the arm's movements in 3D space.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Mathematical Model:** Define the forward kinematics equations for the 3-DOF robotic arm.  This involves expressing the end-effector position as a function of the joint angles.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Solution:** Derive the inverse kinematics equations from the forward kinematics model. This will involve solving for the joint angles given the desired end-effector position. This might involve trigonometric manipulation.
3. **Python Implementation:** Translate the mathematical model and the IK solution into Python code, including input validation and output formatting.
4. **Testing:**  Test the solver with various input positions within the arm's reachable workspace. Verify the accuracy of the calculated joint angles by comparing them with the expected results from the forward kinematics equations.
5. **(Optional) Visualization/GUI:** If time permits, implement a simple visualization or GUI for interactive input and output.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Singularities:**  Handle potential singularities in the robotic arm's configuration, which may lead to multiple solutions or no solution at all.  A simple approach could be to define the workspace and limit inputs to avoid singularities.
- **Workspace Limitations:** Account for the physical limitations of the robotic arm's workspace. Implement checks to ensure that the requested position is within the achievable range.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of inverse kinematics:** This project provides practical experience in deriving and implementing IK solutions, a fundamental concept in robotics.
- **Enhance problem-solving skills in robotics:**  The project challenges the developer to translate a theoretical problem into a working software solution, improving problem-solving and debugging skills.
