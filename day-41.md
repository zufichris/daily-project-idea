# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system that enables a robotic arm to detect and track a specific object in real-time using a computer vision model.  This demonstrates a fundamental aspect of robotic manipulation and is scalable for more complex automation tasks. The focus is on a rapid prototype showcasing core functionality, not a polished, production-ready system.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on pre-trained model choice), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR3e â€“ simulation possible), Webcam or similar camera
- **Software:** ROS (optional, for advanced robotic arm control)


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  Accurately detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across frames, compensating for movement and minor occlusions.
- **Position Reporting:**  Report the object's (x, y, z) coordinates relative to the robot arm's base.
- **Basic Arm Movement (Optional):**  Command the robotic arm to move to a position above the tracked object (requires appropriate robotic arm API integration).
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the camera feed with bounding boxes around the detected object and its tracked trajectory.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy) and connect to the robotic arm (if using physical hardware; otherwise, setup a simulation).
2. **Object Detection Model Integration:** Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet) and adapt it to detect the target object.  Fine-tuning might be needed, but using a pre-trained model is crucial for time constraints.
3. **Tracking Implementation:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, simple centroid tracking) to maintain object position across frames.
4. **Coordinate Transformation (Optional):**  Convert pixel coordinates from the camera to real-world coordinates relative to the robot arm's base (requires camera calibration parameters).
5. **Arm Control (Optional):**  Send commands to the robotic arm based on the tracked object's position to move the arm above the object.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing of video streams can be computationally intensive.  Choosing an efficient object detection model and optimizing code is crucial.
- **Accuracy of Tracking:**  Occlusion, lighting changes, and object movement can affect tracking accuracy.  Robust tracking algorithms are needed to mitigate these issues, but simplified methods are acceptable for this time constraint.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of computer vision techniques:** This project solidifies understanding of object detection, tracking, and coordinate transformations.
- **Integration of computer vision with robotics:**  This project demonstrates a practical application of computer vision algorithms in controlling robotic systems.
