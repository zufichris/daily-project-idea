# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent employing the Minimax algorithm.  The game will feature a visual representation of the board and the AI's decision-making process, allowing for observation of the algorithm's evaluation of game states.  This provides a practical demonstration of a classic AI search algorithm within a constrained, easily understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for graphics and game loop), NumPy (optional, for matrix representation of the board)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  Playable Tic-Tac-Toe game against an AI opponent.
    -  AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves.
    -  Visual representation of the game board using Pygame.
    -  Clear indication of the current player's turn.
    -  Win/loss/draw detection and display.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Visualization of the Minimax tree (simplified, showing a few levels).
    -  Difficulty selection (e.g., varying search depth for Minimax).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board Setup:** Create a Pygame window and draw the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Implement functions to handle player input (clicks) and update the board state accordingly.
2. **Minimax Algorithm:** Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency.  This function will take the current board state as input and return the best move for the AI player.
3. **AI Integration:** Integrate the Minimax function into the game loop.  The AI should make its move after the human player.
4. **Win/Loss/Draw Detection:** Implement logic to detect win, loss, or draw conditions and display the appropriate message.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If time allows, implement basic visualization of the Minimax tree or highlight the AI's evaluation of different board states.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Implementation:**  Correctly implementing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning requires careful attention to detail and recursive function design.
- **Pygame Integration:** Efficiently integrating Pygame's graphics and event handling with the game logic can be challenging for those unfamiliar with the library.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Algorithm Design:**  This project strengthens understanding of tree search algorithms, specifically the Minimax algorithm and its optimization through alpha-beta pruning.
- **Game Development Fundamentals:**  Practical experience with game development using Pygame, including event handling, game loop design, and visual representation.
