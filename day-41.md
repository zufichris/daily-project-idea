# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple, self-balancing robot arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller.  The arm will attempt to maintain a target angle despite external disturbances, demonstrating a fundamental application of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control.  The project's significance lies in its compact implementation of a complex control algorithm, easily adaptable to more sophisticated robotic systems.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 is an option for wireless communication).
- **Servo Motor:** A high-torque servo capable of accurate positioning.
- **Sensor:** MPU6050 (or similar IMU) for measuring angle and angular velocity.
- **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE (C++).
- **Libraries:**  `Wire.h` (for I2C communication with the IMU), Servo library.


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain a specified target angle (e.g., 45 degrees) using PID control.
- **Angle Measurement:** Accurate angle reading from the IMU.
- **Servo Control:** Precise control of the servo motor based on PID output.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Visual feedback (optional: via serial monitor) showing the current angle and control signal.
- **Stability under Perturbations:** The arm should resist small external forces applied to it.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a user interface (e.g., potentiometer) to adjust the setpoint angle.
- **Optional Feature:**  Data logging for analysis of PID controller performance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the microcontroller according to their datasheets.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the IMU to obtain accurate angle readings.
3. **PID Implementation:** Implement the PID control algorithm in the Arduino code, tuning the P, I, and D gains for optimal performance.  Start with a simple P-controller, then add I and D terms progressively.
4. **Servo Control Loop:** Integrate the PID output to control the servo motor's position.
5. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the system's stability, adjusting the PID gains iteratively until satisfactory performance is achieved.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **IMU Noise:** Filtering IMU data to reduce noise and improve accuracy is crucial for stability.  Consider using a complementary filter or Kalman filter (more advanced).
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains requires iterative testing and adjustments.  Techniques like Ziegler-Nichols method can aid in the process.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:**  This project reinforces the understanding and practical application of PID control algorithms, a fundamental concept in robotics and automation.
- **Real-time System Design:**  Designing and implementing a real-time control system, encompassing sensor integration, data processing, and actuator control, will be a valuable experience.
