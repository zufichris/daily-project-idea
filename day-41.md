# Mini-Max Reinforcement Learning for Simple Game AI

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a simple reinforcement learning agent using the Mini-Max algorithm to play a deterministic two-player game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.  The goal is to create a functional AI opponent that can be trained and tested within a day or two.  This provides a practical application of reinforcement learning concepts and algorithm implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pygame (optional, for visualization)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Engine:**  A functional game engine for the chosen game (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
- **Mini-Max Algorithm:** Implementation of the Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient search.
- **Evaluation Function:** A heuristic evaluation function to assess board states and guide the Mini-Max search.
- **Game Play:** Ability to play against the AI agent.
- **Win/Loss Tracking:**  Track the win/loss ratio of the AI agent against a human player or a random opponent.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a simple learning mechanism to adjust the evaluation function based on game outcomes.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Visualization using Pygame to display the game board and AI's decision-making process.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Engine:** Create a basic game engine to handle game logic, board representation, and move validation.
2. **Mini-Max Implementation:** Implement the Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.  Start with a simple evaluation function (e.g., count the number of pieces in a row).
3. **AI Integration:** Integrate the Mini-Max algorithm into the game engine to allow the AI to make moves.
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the AI against human players and/or a random agent.  Refine the evaluation function based on observed performance.
5. **Optional: Visualization:** If time allows, add visualization using Pygame to enhance the user experience.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Evaluation Function Design:**  Creating a good heuristic evaluation function is crucial for the AI's performance.  A poorly designed function can lead to suboptimal play.  Experimentation and iterative refinement will be needed.
- **Computational Complexity:** For more complex games like Connect Four, the search space can become large.  Efficient implementation of alpha-beta pruning is vital to manage computational complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement the understanding of Mini-Max search algorithms and their application in game AI.
- Practical experience in implementing and testing a reinforcement learning agent in a simple yet challenging environment.
