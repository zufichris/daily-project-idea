# Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Python-based solver for the inverse kinematics problem of a 3-DOF robotic arm.  Given a desired end-effector position and orientation (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw), the solver will calculate the corresponding joint angles required to achieve that pose.  This is a fundamental problem in robotics, and a fast, accurate solution is crucial for many robotic applications.  This daily challenge focuses on a simplified 3-DOF arm for manageable complexity.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (specifically `optimize.fsolve` or similar), Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Features & Requirements

- **Inverse Kinematics Solution:**  Calculate joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) for a given end-effector pose (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw).  Assume a simplified robotic arm model (e.g., revolute joints, known link lengths).
- **Pose Input:**  Allow the user to specify the desired end-effector pose through command-line arguments or a simple configuration file.
- **Solution Output:**  Display the calculated joint angles to the console.
- **Error Handling:**  Implement basic error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs or unsolvable configurations.
- **Unit Testing (Optional):** Write simple unit tests to verify the accuracy of the solver for a few known configurations.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Definition:** Define the robot arm's kinematic model using forward kinematics equations (relating joint angles to end-effector pose).  This involves specifying link lengths and joint types.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Algorithm:** Implement the inverse kinematics algorithm using numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson method or a library function like `scipy.optimize.fsolve`.  This will involve solving a system of non-linear equations.
3. **Input Parsing & Output Formatting:**  Write code to parse the user-supplied pose input and format the calculated joint angles for clear output.
4. **Error Handling & Validation:**  Add checks for invalid inputs (e.g., unreachable poses) and handle them appropriately.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If time permits, use Matplotlib to visualize the robot arm and its end-effector in its calculated pose.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Solution Uniqueness:** Inverse kinematics often has multiple solutions.  The algorithm should ideally find a solution that is physically feasible (avoiding joint limits). A simplification to a 2D planar arm could mitigate this complexity for a daily challenge.
- **Numerical Stability:**  Numerical methods can be sensitive to initial guesses.  Careful selection of initial values and potentially iterative refinement may be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Inverse Kinematics Concepts:**  This project strengthens understanding of the inverse kinematics problem, its mathematical formulation, and numerical solution techniques.
- **Practice with Numerical Optimization:** The project provides hands-on experience with using numerical optimization libraries in Python, enhancing problem-solving skills in a robotics context.
