# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures.  The system will prioritize simplicity and rapid prototyping, focusing on core functionality rather than exhaustive feature sets.  This demonstrates integration of multiple input modalities for a common IoT application.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyAudio (audio input), OpenCV (computer vision for gesture recognition),  a suitable library for your chosen smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant API, if using that).
* **Hardware:**  A microphone, a webcam, and the target smart home appliance (e.g., a smart bulb controlled via WiFi).
* **Optional:**  A Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer (SBC) for a more portable and embedded solution.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to basic voice commands like "Turn on," "Turn off," and "Dim" for the chosen appliance.
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, hand up/down for brightness control).
- **Appliance Integration:** Seamless integration with the chosen smart home appliance.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Provide visual or audio feedback to confirm commands execution.
- **Error Handling:**  Handle potential errors (e.g., unrecognized voice command, incorrect gesture).

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Extend the system to control more than one device.
- **User Profiles:**  Allow different users to have their own voice profiles and gesture mappings.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the smart home appliance API.
2. **Voice Command Recognition:** Implement a basic voice command recognition system using PyAudio and a simple keyword spotting technique or a pre-trained speech recognition model (e.g., a small model from Google Cloud Speech-to-Text).
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement basic gesture recognition using OpenCV. Focus on simple gestures like waving or up/down movements.  Use pre-trained models or simple background subtraction techniques for efficiency.
4. **Appliance Control:** Integrate voice and gesture recognition with the smart home appliance API to send commands.
5. **Feedback and Error Handling:** Implement basic feedback mechanisms (e.g., print statements initially) and handle potential errors gracefully.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:**  Achieving high accuracy in both voice and gesture recognition can be challenging with limited time and resources. Focus on simplicity and robustness rather than perfect accuracy.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Processing both audio and video streams in real-time may require optimization to avoid delays.  Start with simple algorithms.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Input Integration:**  Gain experience integrating different input modalities (voice and vision) in a single application.
- **Real-time System Development:**  Learn how to design and implement a system that processes data in real-time with constraints on processing power and time.
