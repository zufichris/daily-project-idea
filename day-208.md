# Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Python-based inverse kinematics solver for a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).  Inverse kinematics is a crucial aspect of robotics, allowing for precise control of the robotic arm's end-effector by specifying its desired position and orientation. This daily challenge will implement a solution using numerical methods, focusing on speed and accuracy within a limited timeframe.  The solution could be readily applied to control a physical robotic arm or simulated one.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy (specifically `optimize.fsolve` or similar for numerical root finding)
- IDE:  PyCharm, VS Code, or similar
- (Optional) Robotics Simulation Software: PyBullet, V-REP (for testing and visualization)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - Accepts target (x, y, z) coordinates as input.
    - Calculates the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) required to reach the target coordinates.
    - Implements a numerical iterative solver (e.g., Newton-Raphson or a simpler approach) for inverse kinematics.
    - Returns calculated joint angles.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Incorporates obstacle avoidance (simple collision detection).
    - Includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Robotic Arm Model:** Define the kinematic parameters (link lengths) of a 3-DOF robotic arm.  This can be a simplified model for this challenge.
2. **Implement Forward Kinematics:**  Write a function that calculates the end-effector position (x, y, z) given the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3). This is crucial for validating the inverse kinematics solution.
3. **Implement Inverse Kinematics Solver:** Utilize `scipy.optimize.fsolve` or a similar numerical method to find the joint angles that satisfy the desired end-effector position. This involves defining the error function (difference between desired and actual position) which `fsolve` will minimize.
4. **Testing and Validation:** Test the solver with various target positions and validate the results by comparing them to the forward kinematics calculations.
5. **(Optional) Integration with Simulation:**  If time permits, integrate the solver with a robotics simulation environment (like PyBullet) to visualize the arm's movement.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Singularities:**  Singular configurations of the robotic arm can lead to multiple solutions or no solution. Handling these situations gracefully (e.g., returning an error message or selecting a suitable solution) is important.
- **Numerical Solver Convergence:** The numerical solver might not converge to a solution for all inputs.  Choosing appropriate initial guesses and solver parameters can improve convergence.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcing understanding of robotic arm kinematics (forward and inverse).
- Gaining practical experience with numerical methods and their application in robotics.
- Improving proficiency in Python programming and utilizing scientific computing libraries.
