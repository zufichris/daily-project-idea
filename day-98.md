# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a miniature self-balancing robot arm using a microcontroller and a PID control algorithm. The arm will be designed to maintain a stable upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating fundamental concepts in robotics and control systems.  This project focuses on a smaller scale to make it achievable within a 1-2 day timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 IoT (or similar with sufficient processing power and I/O)
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)
* **Sensors:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU), Potentiometer (for arm angle)
* **Actuators:** Small servo motors (2-3, depending on arm design)
* **Framework/Libraries:**  PID control library (can be implemented from scratch or using an existing library)
* **Tools:** Breadboard, Jumper wires, soldering iron (if necessary), 3D printer (highly recommended for arm structure).

## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position despite external pushes or tilts.
- **Angle Measurement:** Accurate measurement of the arm's angle using the potentiometer.
- **PID Control Implementation:** Implement a PID controller to adjust servo motor positions for balance.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide real-time feedback on arm angle and adjustments made by the PID controller (e.g., via serial monitor).
- **Stable Base:**  A robust base design that prevents the robot from tipping over easily.


- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporate a simple object detection system using a distance sensor (e.g., ultrasonic sensor) to avoid obstacles.
- **Optional Features:**  Add a small gripper to allow the arm to manipulate lightweight objects.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the robot arm structure (3D printed or otherwise), connect the IMU, potentiometer, and servo motors to the microcontroller.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the IMU and potentiometer to ensure accurate readings.
3. **PID Implementation:** Implement or integrate a PID control library, tuning the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to optimize the arm's balancing performance.
4. **Software Integration:** Write the main program to read sensor data, apply the PID algorithm, and control the servo motors accordingly.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system's performance, adjust PID gains, and fine-tune the code for optimal stability.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with conservative gains and gradually increase them.
- **Sensor Noise:** IMU readings can be noisy; appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) may be required to improve accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** Gain practical experience with implementing and tuning a PID controller, a crucial algorithm in robotics and control systems.
- **Embedded Systems Development:** Enhance skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and actuator control within the context of a real-world robotic application.
