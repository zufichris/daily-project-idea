# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project involves creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.  The game will feature a visual representation of the board and the AI's decision-making process. The goal is to implement a robust and efficient Minimax algorithm and visualize its operation, demonstrating optimal game play.  This project is significant because it allows for a practical application of a fundamental AI search algorithm within a constrained timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (optional, for board representation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -   A playable Tic-Tac-Toe game with a human player and an AI opponent.
    -   Implementation of the Minimax algorithm to determine the AI's moves.
    -   Visual representation of the game board using Pygame.
    -   Clear indication of the winner (or draw).
    -   User-friendly interface for playing the game.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -   Visualization of the Minimax search tree (simplified representation).
    -   Difficulty levels adjusting the search depth of the Minimax algorithm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the game board and display:** Create the game board using Pygame, displaying it visually to the user.  Handle user input for placing their mark (X or O).

2. **Implement the Minimax algorithm:**  Write a recursive function implementing the Minimax algorithm to evaluate game states and determine the best move for the AI.

3. **Integrate AI with the game loop:** Incorporate the AI's move selection into the main game loop. The AI should make its move after the human player.

4. **Determine the winner or draw:**  Implement logic to detect a win or a draw and display the appropriate message.

5. **(Optional) Add visualization:** If time permits, visualize the Minimax search tree or highlight the AI's evaluated moves on the board.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Algorithm Complexity:**  The Minimax algorithm's recursive nature can be challenging to implement correctly and efficiently, especially handling base cases and recursion depth. Careful testing and debugging are essential.

- **Pygame Integration:** Integrating the game logic with Pygame's graphical elements requires attention to event handling and visual updates to maintain a responsive and user-friendly interface.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforced Concepts:** This project reinforces understanding of the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental AI search technique used in game playing and decision-making.

- **Practical Skills:**  This project enhances practical programming skills in Python, game development using Pygame, and algorithmic implementation.  It also promotes efficient problem-solving within time constraints.
