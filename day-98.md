# Smart Home Device Integration with a Minimalist API

## Overview
This project aims to create a minimalist RESTful API that allows a smart home device (e.g., a smart bulb, a smart plug) to interact with other smart home systems or applications.  This avoids vendor lock-in and allows for greater flexibility and control over the device.  The focus is on building a functional prototype in a short timeframe, emphasizing core functionalities and clean design.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python (with Flask or FastAPI)
- Database: SQLite (for simplicity and speed of development)
- API Design: RESTful principles
- Tools: Postman (for API testing), VS Code (or preferred IDE)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Expose at least two device controls via HTTP endpoints (e.g., ON/OFF, brightness).
    - Implement basic authentication to secure the API.
    - Store device state (e.g., current brightness level) in the database.
    - Return JSON-formatted responses for easy integration.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implement a webhook system to notify external systems of state changes.
    - Add support for a more robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Environment:** Set up a Python environment, install necessary libraries (Flask/FastAPI, SQLite), and create a project structure.
2. **API Development:** Define API endpoints for controlling the device.  Implement basic authentication (e.g., API key). Handle requests, update the database, and return appropriate responses.
3. **Database Interaction:**  Create the database schema, establish connections, and implement database operations (CRUD) for storing and retrieving device state.
4. **Testing:**  Use Postman or similar tools to thoroughly test all API endpoints and ensure correct functionality and error handling.
5. **Documentation:** Create basic API documentation (using Swagger or similar) to describe the endpoints and their usage.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Real-time Device Interaction:** Simulating real-time device control might require external libraries or emulators if no physical device is available. The focus should be on the API functionality itself.
- **Security:** While basic authentication is implemented, more robust security measures (e.g., OAuth 2.0) might be challenging within the timeframe.  Focus on a secure, but simple approach.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of RESTful API design principles, including HTTP methods, status codes, and JSON data exchange.
- Gain practical experience in building and testing a secure and efficient API using Python and a lightweight database.
