# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent using reinforcement learning (RL) to play a minimalist game.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating fundamental RL concepts within a constrained timeframe. The chosen game will be a simplified version of a classic, easily implemented within a day or two, allowing for experimentation with different RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for RL implementation)
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple, deterministic game environment (e.g., a grid-based navigation problem with rewards and penalties).
    - An RL agent trained using a suitable algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler variant).
    - Visualization of the agent's learning process (e.g., plotting rewards over time, visualizing agent's actions).
    - Basic agent decision-making based on learned policy.
    - Saving and loading of trained models.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN) if time permits).
    - Incorporating a simple GUI for user interaction.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game rules and create a simple environment using Python and Gym (or custom environment). This should involve defining the state space, action space, reward function, and game termination conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity) and implement the agent's learning process. This will involve updating the agent's Q-table or neural network based on interactions with the environment.
3. **Training & Evaluation:** Train the agent by letting it interact with the environment and observe its performance. Plot reward curves to analyze learning progress.
4. **Visualization:** Visualize the agent's actions and decision-making process within the game environment.
5. **Model Persistence:** Implement saving and loading of the trained agent's model (Q-table or neural network weights) for future use.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate RL algorithm that balances complexity and achievable results within the time constraint.  Starting with a simpler algorithm like Q-learning is strongly advised.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding the right hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) for the chosen RL algorithm can require experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts.
- Experience in designing and implementing a simple RL environment.
- Proficiency in using a chosen deep learning framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras) for RL.
