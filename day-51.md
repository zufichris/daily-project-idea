# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will utilize a computer vision library to process camera input and translate specific gestures into commands to control the appliance via a pre-defined API. This offers a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional control methods.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), requests (for API interaction)
* **Hardware:**  A webcam or built-in laptop camera, a smart home device with an accessible API (e.g., a Philips Hue lamp, a smart fan with an IFTTT integration).
* **Optional:** A Raspberry Pi for standalone operation (requires additional setup and configuration).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:** The system should accurately detect and classify predefined hand gestures (e.g., open hand for "on", closed fist for "off", wave for "brightness up/down").
- **Appliance Control Integration:**  The system should send commands to the chosen smart appliance via its API based on recognized gestures.
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple visual feedback mechanism (e.g., on-screen display of recognized gesture and appliance status).
- **Calibration:** An initial calibration step to adjust sensitivity and hand position detection.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for cases like API failures or gesture misrecognition.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Expand to control multiple devices simultaneously with different gesture combinations.
- **Gesture Customization:** Allow users to define their own custom gestures and mappings.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment & Dependencies:** Install Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and the `requests` library.  Test the API connection to the smart appliance.
2. **Gesture Recognition Module:** Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe and define a gesture classification logic based on hand landmarks.  This may involve simple distance calculations or more advanced machine learning techniques (if time permits).
3. **API Integration:** Create functions to send commands (e.g., "ON," "OFF," "brightness: 50") to the smart appliance's API based on recognized gestures.
4. **UI Development:**  Develop a simple UI (e.g., using OpenCV's window functionality) to display the recognized gesture and the appliance's current state.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and hand positions, adjusting sensitivity parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in hand size, lighting, and background clutter can affect the accuracy of gesture detection.  Consider implementing pre-processing steps to improve robustness.
- **API Limitations:**  The chosen smart appliance's API might have rate limits or require specific authentication methods. Thoroughly understand the API documentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Gain practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand gesture recognition.
- **API Integration:**  Strengthen skills in interacting with external APIs and handling API responses effectively.
