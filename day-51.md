# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured via a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures, translating them into commands for controlling smart devices (e.g., lights, volume). This project emphasizes efficient implementation and showcases real-time image processing techniques within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (Hands), NumPy
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a suitable IDE (PyCharm, VS Code), potentially a virtual environment.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  The system should accurately detect and classify predefined hand gestures (e.g., fist for "off," open hand for "on," thumbs up for "increase volume").
- **Device Control Simulation:**  The system will simulate sending commands to smart devices based on the recognized gestures. This could involve printing the command to the console or triggering simulated actions.
- **Gesture Calibration:**  Allow for basic calibration to adapt to different hand sizes and lighting conditions.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where gestures are not recognized or are ambiguous.
- **Basic UI:** A simple graphical user interface (GUI) displaying the recognized gesture and simulated command.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a real smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant) for actual device control.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporate a model training component to allow users to define custom gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, set up the webcam, and test basic OpenCV functionality (e.g., capturing and displaying frames).
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement MediaPipe Hands for real-time hand detection and landmark extraction.  Filter out irrelevant landmarks and focus on key points for gesture classification.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Develop a simple logic (e.g., using conditional statements based on landmark positions) or a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a small k-NN classifier) to classify the detected gestures.
4. **Device Control Simulation:** Implement the logic to translate recognized gestures into simulated commands for smart devices (e.g., print commands to the console or trigger simulated actions).
5. **GUI Implementation (Optional):**  If time allows, create a simple GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to display the recognized gesture and simulated command.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variability in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of hand detection.  Experiment with image preprocessing techniques (e.g., adaptive thresholding) to mitigate this.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Similar gestures can lead to misclassification.  Careful selection of gestures and robust classification algorithms are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Image Processing:**  Gain practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and analysis.
- **Gesture Recognition Techniques:** Learn how to extract relevant features from hand images and classify them for control applications.
