# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking using a Webcam

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object detection and tracking system using a webcam feed.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball, a person) within the camera's view. This is a practical application of computer vision and can be a foundation for more complex projects like robotic navigation or automated surveillance.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for pre-trained model), NumPy
* **Tools:** Webcam, IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), possibly a Jupyter Notebook for rapid prototyping.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should detect the predefined object in the webcam feed at a reasonable frame rate (at least 10 fps).
- **Object Tracking:** Once detected, the system should track the object's movement across the frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:**  A bounding box should be drawn around the detected object on the video stream.
- **Object Centroid Tracking:** Calculate and display the centroid (center point) coordinates of the detected object.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to gauge performance.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple object counting feature to track the number of objects appearing in the frame.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Allow users to select the object to track (through a simple GUI or by changing a configuration file).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy) and set up your development environment. Download a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet).
2. **Webcam Access:**  Write code to access the webcam feed using OpenCV.
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Integrate the pre-trained model to detect the object in each frame. Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using centroid tracking or Kalman filter for smoother tracking).
4. **Visualization:** Display the webcam feed with bounding boxes and object centroid coordinates overlaid. Display the FPS.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and object movements.  Adjust parameters (e.g., confidence threshold) for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:** Real-time processing can be demanding.  If the chosen model is too complex for your hardware, consider using a lighter-weight model or reducing the resolution of the webcam feed.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracker might lose the object if it's temporarily occluded. Explore more robust tracking algorithms (e.g., deepSORT) if time allows.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision techniques:** Gain hands-on experience with object detection, tracking, and video processing using OpenCV.
- **Master integration of pre-trained models:** Learn how to effectively utilize pre-trained deep learning models for specific tasks without building a model from scratch.
