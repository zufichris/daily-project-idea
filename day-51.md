# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a person, a ball) within its field of view, providing coordinates and potentially other relevant data. This is a valuable prototype for applications in robotics, surveillance, and automation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (or similar lightweight model for inference)
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (4 recommended), USB camera, power supply
* **Tools:**  A text editor (VS Code, Thonny), SSH client (optional for remote access)

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Continuously track the detected object's centroid (center point) coordinates.
- **Coordinate Display:** Display the object's (x, y) coordinates on the camera feed or console.
- **Frame Rate Monitoring:**  Display the processing FPS (frames per second) to assess performance.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log the object's position data to a file for later analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Installation:** Set up the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite), and test the camera connection.
2. **Object Detection Model Selection:** Download a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a MobileNet SSD model converted to TensorFlow Lite) suitable for the target object.
3. **Real-time Processing:** Write a Python script to capture frames from the camera, perform object detection using the selected model, and track the object's centroid.
4. **Coordinate Display and FPS Calculation:** Implement the display of (x, y) coordinates and calculate/display the frames per second (FPS).
5. **Optional: Data Logging:** Add code to log the object's coordinates and timestamp to a CSV or other suitable file format.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Limitations:**  The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the FPS, particularly with complex models. Consider using a smaller, faster model or optimizing the code.
- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models might not be perfectly accurate for specific objects or lighting conditions.  Fine-tuning might be necessary for higher accuracy, but is beyond the scope of a daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of real-time image processing:**  This project provides hands-on experience with capturing, processing, and analyzing video streams.
- **Gain experience with object detection and tracking algorithms:** This project will deepen your understanding of how these algorithms work, from model selection to implementation.
