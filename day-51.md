# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures performed in front of the camera, translating them into commands to control smart home devices (e.g., lights, thermostat). This allows for a more intuitive and contactless interaction with smart home technology. The focus for the daily challenge is to build a functional prototype capable of recognizing at least three distinct gestures.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras (optional for advanced feature)
* **Tools:** Webcam, Jupyter Notebook/IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  Real-time capture and processing of hand gestures from a webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Accurate recognition of at least three predefined gestures (e.g., hand open, closed fist, thumbs up).
- **Command Mapping:** Mapping recognized gestures to specific smart home commands (e.g., open/close lights, increase/decrease thermostat).
- **Visual Feedback:** Displaying the recognized gesture and corresponding command on screen.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Gracefully handling cases where gestures are not recognized.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Model training and improvement using a small dataset of custom gestures.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Integration with a real smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Capture a small dataset of images for each target gesture using the webcam.  Use OpenCV to preprocess the images (resizing, grayscale conversion).
2. **Feature Extraction:** Employ MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to extract relevant features from the images (hand landmarks).
3. **Gesture Classification:** Implement a simple classifier (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors or a small, pre-trained neural network if using TensorFlow/Keras) to classify the extracted features.
4. **Command Execution (Simulation):**  Instead of integrating with a smart home API (which might be complex for a daily challenge), simulate command execution by printing the corresponding command to the console.
5. **Interface Development:** Create a simple visual interface using OpenCV to display the video feed, recognized gesture, and simulated command.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with a limited dataset and potentially noisy webcam input.  Addressing this may involve careful data collection and preprocessing techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:** Ensuring that the processing speed is fast enough for real-time gesture recognition. This can be optimized by carefully selecting algorithms and processing only essential information.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of image processing techniques:** This project strengthens the practical application of OpenCV and image manipulation skills.
- **Introduction to gesture recognition:**  Practical experience with developing a simple gesture recognition system, from data acquisition to classification.
