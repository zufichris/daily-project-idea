# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, wave) to control specific smart home devices or functions. This project focuses on a simplified, yet functional, system that can be prototyped and tested within a day or two. The significance lies in exploring a more intuitive and contactless interaction method for smart homes.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), and a relevant library for interacting with smart home devices (e.g., home-assistant-api).
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a laptop/desktop with a decent CPU/GPU for image processing.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time gesture detection:**  The system should accurately detect pre-defined hand gestures from a webcam feed in real-time.
- **Smart home device control:**  Integration with at least one smart home device (e.g., a smart light, fan) to trigger actions based on detected gestures (e.g., thumbs up to turn on a light, thumbs down to turn it off).
- **User interface:** A simple visual interface displaying the recognized gesture and the corresponding smart home action.
- **Calibration/Training:** Optional user calibration to improve gesture recognition accuracy based on individual hand sizes and styles.
- **Multiple gesture support:** Initially support 2-3 gestures, extensible to more.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Set up the development environment, install necessary libraries, and test the webcam feed using OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking module to detect and identify pre-defined gestures.  Focus on a small set of simple gestures initially.
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Choose a smart home device and integrate its API to trigger actions based on the recognized gestures.
4. **User Interface Development:** Create a basic visual interface using a library like Tkinter or PyQt to display the detected gesture and the resulting action on the smart home device.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with different lighting conditions and hand positions, refining the gesture recognition parameters as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy and robustness:**  Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition across different lighting conditions and hand poses can be challenging.  Consider incorporating techniques like background subtraction and hand segmentation to improve robustness.
- **Real-time processing:**  Processing the webcam feed and performing gesture recognition in real-time requires efficient algorithms and optimization.  Consider using optimized libraries and techniques to minimize latency.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with computer vision libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- Hands-on experience with integrating different software components (computer vision, smart home API, user interface) to build a functional system.
