# Self-Calibrating Robotic Gripper with Force Feedback

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a basic self-calibrating robotic gripper simulation using force feedback to improve grip strength and object manipulation. The purpose is to create a simplified model that demonstrates the core principles of self-calibration within a limited timeframe, highlighting the challenges and potential of this technology.  The significance lies in exploring the efficiency and accuracy gains achievable through real-time calibration for robotic manipulation.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), SciPy (for optimization algorithms if time permits)
- **Simulation Environment:**  A simple 2D simulation will suffice for a 1-2 day project.  A more complex 3D simulation can be considered if time allows.

## Features & Requirements
- **Basic Gripper Model:** Simulate a simple two-finger gripper with adjustable grip width.
- **Force Sensor Simulation:** Implement a simplified force sensor model that estimates the force exerted by the gripper on an object.
- **Self-Calibration Algorithm:**  A basic algorithm to adjust the grip width based on the sensed force, aiming for optimal grip without crushing the object.
- **Object Representation:**  Simple rectangular shapes will suffice to represent objects.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the gripper, object, and force readings graphically using Pygame.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporate different object shapes and material properties influencing grip force. Implement a more sophisticated calibration algorithm (e.g., using PID control).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Gripper and Object Modeling:** Create basic classes to represent the gripper and objects, including their properties (position, size, etc.).
2. **Force Sensor Simulation:**  Develop a function to simulate force based on the grip width and object properties (e.g., simple linear relationship).
3. **Calibration Algorithm Implementation:** Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., proportional control) to adjust the grip width based on the sensed force. Aim for a stable grip without excessive force.
4. **Visualization:** Use Pygame to create a visual representation of the system, showing the gripper, object, and force readings.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the simulation with different objects and adjust parameters to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Calibration Algorithm Design:** Finding a balance between efficient calibration and robust grip requires careful algorithm design.  A too-simple algorithm may not be effective, while an overly complex one may be difficult to implement within the timeframe.
- **Simulation Accuracy:**  The simplified simulation may not accurately reflect real-world physics; however, it will serve the purpose of exploring core concepts.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of Control Systems Principles:** This project will reinforce the basic principles of feedback control systems and their application in robotics.
- **Practical Application of Simulation:**  Participants will gain hands-on experience in creating and utilizing a simplified simulation to explore complex robotic systems.
