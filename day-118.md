# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to build a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection controlled by an intelligent traffic light system. The simulation will utilize basic reinforcement learning to optimize traffic flow, minimizing wait times and congestion. This project is significant because it provides a practical, small-scale model for exploring complex traffic management algorithms without the need for real-world infrastructure or extensive data collection.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), a reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3).

## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Generation:** Simulate vehicles entering the intersection from multiple directions at varying rates and speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light system with customizable cycle lengths and timings.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  Train a simple reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning) to optimize traffic light switching based on the observed traffic density.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track key metrics like average wait time, total stopped time, and throughput.
- **Visualization:** Display the simulation graphically using Pygame, showing vehicle movements, traffic light states, and performance metrics in real-time.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement different traffic light control strategies (e.g., adaptive control based on vehicle type or priority).
- **Optional Feature:** Introduce random events (e.g., accidents) to test the robustness of the system.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Basic Simulation:**  Create the basic structure of the simulation using Pygame, including road representation, vehicle generation, and basic movement logic.
2. **Traffic Light Implementation:** Implement a simple traffic light system with fixed timing cycles.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Integration:**  Integrate a chosen reinforcement learning algorithm, defining the state space, action space, reward function, and training procedure.
4. **Training and Optimization:** Train the reinforcement learning agent and observe its performance. Adjust parameters (e.g., learning rate, reward function) as needed.
5. **Visualization and Evaluation:**  Visualize the simulation and analyze performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the learned policy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Designing an effective reward function that accurately reflects desired system behavior (e.g., minimizing wait times without causing other bottlenecks) can be challenging. Experimentation and iterative refinement will be crucial.
- **Simulation Complexity:** Balancing realism and computational efficiency is crucial.  Overly complex simulations will slow down training and make the project harder to complete within the time constraint.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Implementation:** This project reinforces practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms in a realistic context.
- **Agent-Based Modeling:** Understanding how to model complex systems using agents and interactions between them.
