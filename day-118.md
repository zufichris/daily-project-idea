# Automated Bug Triage System Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype of an automated bug triage system using natural language processing (NLP).  The system will analyze bug reports (text descriptions) and automatically assign them to the appropriate developer based on keywords, project labels, and code ownership.  This significantly speeds up the bug fixing process, improving developer efficiency and response times.  The prototype will focus on a single, well-defined project or codebase.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **NLP Library:** spaCy or NLTK
- **Machine Learning Library:** scikit-learn (optional, for more advanced features)
- **Text Processing Tools:** Regular expressions
- **Database:** SQLite (for storing bug report data and developer assignments)
- **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Bug Report Analysis:**  The system should accurately identify key terms and labels within bug descriptions.
- **Developer Assignment:**  The system should automatically assign bugs to the most appropriate developers based on their expertise (extracted from code ownership data).
- **Priority Classification (Basic):**  Simple priority categorization (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on keywords.
- **Report Summarization (Basic):** Generate a concise summary of each bug report.
- **Data Storage and Retrieval:**  Efficiently store and retrieve bug report data and developer assignments.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Integrate with a bug tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) for seamless data import/export.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a more sophisticated priority classification system using machine learning to consider factors beyond simple keywords.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Collect sample bug reports (at least 50) and corresponding developer assignments. Clean and preprocess the text data (remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, etc.).
2. **Keyword Extraction and Classification:**  Develop a rule-based system or train a simple classifier (using scikit-learn) to identify key terms and assign priorities.
3. **Developer Assignment Logic:** Create a mapping between keywords/labels and developer assignments. This could be based on code ownership data or manually defined rules.
4. **Prototype Development:**  Implement a simple script that takes a bug report as input, processes it using the developed NLP techniques, and outputs the assigned developer and priority level.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the prototype with a variety of bug reports and refine the NLP techniques and assignment logic based on the results.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Ambiguity in Bug Reports:** Natural language is inherently ambiguous, making accurate keyword extraction challenging. Consider using techniques like stemming and lemmatization to improve accuracy.
- **Data Scarcity:**  A limited number of bug reports may hinder the accuracy of machine learning models. Focus on robust rule-based techniques initially to mitigate this issue.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of NLP:** This project will provide hands-on experience in applying NLP techniques to real-world problems.
- **Data Processing and Analysis:**  Students will learn to preprocess and analyze text data to extract meaningful insights.
