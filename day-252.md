# Intelligent Room Lighting Automation

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a prototype for an intelligent room lighting system that automatically adjusts lighting levels based on ambient light conditions and occupancy.  The system will leverage a simple sensor network and a central processing unit to provide a responsive and energy-efficient solution.  This is a practical application of embedded systems and sensor data processing suitable for a short development cycle.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries like RPi.GPIO for Raspberry Pi interaction or similar libraries for other microcontroller platforms)
- **Microcontroller/Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Zero W (or similar low-power microcontroller)
- **Sensors:** Ambient light sensor (e.g., BH1750), PIR motion sensor
- **Actuators:**  Simple relay module to control a light fixture (LED strip or incandescent bulb)
- **Software Tools:**  A text editor (VS Code, Atom, etc.), Git for version control (optional but recommended).

## Features & Requirements
- **Automatic Light Adjustment:**  The system should automatically adjust light intensity based on ambient light levels, keeping the room brightly lit during the day and dimming the lights in low-light conditions.
- **Occupancy Detection:**  The system should detect human presence using a PIR motion sensor and turn on the lights upon detection.  Lights should turn off after a period of inactivity (configurable delay).
- **Manual Override:** Users should be able to manually override the automatic system using a simple user interface (e.g., a physical button or a simple web interface).
- **Energy Efficiency:** The system should prioritize energy savings by minimizing light usage when unnecessary.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Record sensor readings and light adjustments for analysis and optimization.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the sensors, relay, and microcontroller according to wiring diagrams. Test individual components to ensure functionality.
2. **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Write Python code to read data from the light sensor and PIR motion sensor.  Implement basic filtering to avoid false readings.
3. **Logic Implementation:** Develop the core logic to control the light based on sensor inputs. Implement the automatic adjustment, occupancy detection, and manual override features.
4. **Relay Control:** Write the code to switch the light on/off using the relay module.  Implement appropriate safety mechanisms to prevent overloading.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the entire system under various lighting and occupancy scenarios. Fine-tune the sensitivity and thresholds of the system based on the testing results.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Sensor Noise:**  Addressing noise in sensor readings (light fluctuations, false motion detection) might require implementing filtering or averaging techniques.
- **Power Consumption:** Optimizing the power consumption of the microcontroller and sensors is crucial for a long-term deployment.  This might involve selecting low-power components and implementing power-saving modes.

## Learning Outcomes
- This project reinforces skills in embedded systems programming, sensor integration, and real-time data processing.
-  It demonstrates the practical application of control systems and automation principles using readily available hardware and software tools.
