# Mini-Game AI for Retro Game Emulation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging AI agent capable of playing a classic arcade game like Pong or Breakout within an emulator.  The focus is on creating a functional, albeit rudimentary, AI using a reinforcement learning approach within a constrained timeframe. This project demonstrates fundamental AI concepts and efficient implementation strategies.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game interaction and rendering), a reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3)
* **Emulator (Optional):**  A pre-existing emulator (e.g., a simplified Pong emulator) or building a basic one in Pygame.


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Integration:** The AI must seamlessly interact with the chosen game's environment.
- **Action Selection:** The AI should select actions (e.g., paddle movement) based on game state.
- **Reward System:** A reward mechanism should guide the AI's learning (e.g., points scored, ball proximity).
- **Learning Algorithm:** Implement a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler variant).
- **Basic Performance Metric:**  Track a simple metric like average score over multiple games.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple neural network for improved state representation.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Allow for user-adjustable parameters like learning rate and exploration rate.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Choose a game (or create a minimal emulator), install necessary libraries, and establish basic game interaction using Pygame.
2. **Define State & Actions:**  Represent the game state (e.g., ball position, paddle position) and define the possible actions the AI can take.
3. **Implement Reinforcement Learning:** Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement the core learning loop, updating the AI's policy based on rewards.
4. **Training & Evaluation:**  Train the AI for a set number of iterations, periodically evaluating its performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  Visualize the AI's performance (e.g., plot average score over time).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Time Constraint:**  Balancing the complexity of the AI algorithm and the time available is crucial. Consider using a simplified RL algorithm.
- **Game Complexity:**  Highly complex games will require more sophisticated AI techniques, possibly exceeding the daily timeframe.  Choosing a simpler game is recommended.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project provides practical experience with core RL concepts, such as rewards, states, actions, and policy updates.
- **Efficient Implementation:**  The time constraint encourages efficient coding practices and problem-solving, focusing on delivering a functional prototype rather than a polished product.
