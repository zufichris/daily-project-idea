# Smart Home Device Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to create a rudimentary prototype of a smart home device control system using a combination of voice recognition and simple hand gestures. The goal is to demonstrate a multimodal interface for controlling basic smart home functionalities, showcasing the potential of combining different input modalities for a more intuitive user experience.  This prototype will focus on a single device or a small group of simulated devices.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `SpeechRecognition` (for voice recognition)
    * `opencv-python` (for gesture recognition - basic hand detection)
    * `pyautogui` (for simulated device control - can be replaced with actual device APIs if available)
* **Hardware (Optional):** A webcam.  Can be simulated with pre-recorded videos.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Recognize voice commands to turn lights on/off, adjust volume, etc. (limited vocabulary).
- **Gesture Control:** Detect simple hand gestures (e.g., open hand for on, closed fist for off) using basic image processing.
- **Device Simulation:**  Simulate smart home devices (lights, volume) using `pyautogui` or a similar library; this avoids integration complexities within the daily challenge timeframe.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide visual or auditory feedback to confirm successful command execution.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle voice recognition errors and invalid gestures.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multi-Device Control:** Extend control to multiple simulated devices.
- **Improved Gesture Recognition:** Implement more sophisticated gesture recognition techniques beyond simple hand detection.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the development environment.  If using a webcam, ensure it's connected and functioning correctly.
2. **Voice Recognition Integration:** Implement voice command recognition using `SpeechRecognition`, focusing on a small set of predefined commands.
3. **Basic Gesture Recognition:** Use `opencv-python` to detect a simple hand gesture (open/closed) from webcam feed or video. Pre-processed videos can accelerate development.
4. **Device Control Simulation:** Implement logic to simulate device control based on voice and gesture input using `pyautogui`.
5. **Feedback & Error Handling:** Integrate a feedback mechanism (e.g., print statements, simple GUI) and handle potential errors gracefully.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Voice and Gesture Recognition:** Achieving high accuracy with limited training data and simple algorithms is challenging.  Using pre-recorded data for testing can mitigate this initially.
- **Real-time Processing:** Balancing real-time processing with accuracy can be tricky, particularly with basic image processing for gesture recognition. Optimization techniques may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Interface Design:**  Gain experience in designing and implementing systems that combine different input modalities (voice and gesture).
- **Real-time Image and Audio Processing:**  Develop practical skills in handling real-time data streams from a webcam and microphone, improving understanding of signal processing concepts.
