# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home appliance control system using a combination of voice recognition and hand gesture detection.  The system will allow users to control a simulated appliance (e.g., a lamp or fan) using voice commands and simple hand gestures, offering a more intuitive and accessible control method than traditional interfaces. This project focuses on a minimal viable product (MVP) that can be expanded upon.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `pyautogui` (for simulated appliance control)
    * `speech_recognition` (for voice recognition)
    * `mediapipe` (for hand gesture recognition)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A webcam for gesture recognition.

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Turn the simulated appliance ON/OFF using voice commands ("Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan").
- **Gesture Control:** Turn the simulated appliance ON/OFF using predefined hand gestures (e.g., a raised hand for ON, a closed fist for OFF).
- **Simulated Appliance Feedback:**  Provide visual feedback (e.g., print to console) indicating the appliance's current state (ON/OFF).
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where voice or gesture recognition fails.
- **Basic Configuration:** Allow easy adjustment of voice commands and gesture thresholds.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Extend the system to control multiple simulated appliances.
- **Brightness/Speed Control:** Allow users to adjust the brightness of a lamp or the speed of a fan via voice commands or gestures.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary Python libraries (`pip install pyautogui speech_recognition mediapipe`).
2. **Implement Voice Recognition:** Integrate `speech_recognition` to capture and process voice commands, triggering corresponding actions.
3. **Implement Gesture Recognition:** Use `mediapipe` to detect predefined hand gestures from webcam input (if available; otherwise, simulate gestures).  Map gestures to appliance control actions.
4. **Connect Voice & Gesture to Appliance Control:** Use `pyautogui` to simulate appliance control (e.g., printing "Lamp ON" to console).
5. **Add Error Handling and Basic Configuration:** Implement error handling for recognition failures and add basic configuration options for commands and thresholds.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Hand gesture recognition can be sensitive to lighting and background conditions. Robust error handling and clear gesture definitions are crucial.
- **Ambiguity in Voice Commands:**  Voice recognition might misinterpret commands.  Consider using clear, concise commands and implementing fallback mechanisms.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Interaction Design:** Gain experience in designing and implementing systems that respond to multiple input modalities (voice and gesture).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Practice developing applications that process input in real-time and respond dynamically.
