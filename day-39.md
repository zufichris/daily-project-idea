# Intelligent Traffic Light Optimization Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified traffic intersection with intelligent traffic light control using reinforcement learning. The goal is to optimize traffic flow and minimize wait times by training an agent to adjust traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle arrival patterns.  This project focuses on a small-scale simulation to allow for significant progress within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  OpenAI Gym (for reinforcement learning environment), NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for visualization).
* **Optional:** TensorFlow/PyTorch (for more advanced RL algorithms)

## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Simulation:** Simulate vehicle arrivals at the intersection with varying arrival rates and directions.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Implement a Q-learning agent to learn optimal traffic light switching strategies.
- **Reward Function:** Define a reward function that penalizes long wait times and encourages efficient traffic flow.
- **Visualization:**  Display the simulation and agent's performance graphically (e.g., using Matplotlib).
- **Performance Metrics:** Track average wait times, throughput, and other relevant metrics.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm like Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Incorporate different vehicle types (e.g., emergency vehicles) with priority handling.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple traffic intersection simulation using Python and NumPy. Define states (e.g., number of vehicles in each lane), actions (traffic light switching), and a reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent.  Initialize the Q-table and define the learning process (update rule, exploration-exploitation strategy).
3. **Training Loop:**  Run the simulation, allowing the agent to interact with the environment, learn from rewards, and update its Q-table.
4. **Visualization and Evaluation:** Visualize the simulation and plot performance metrics (average wait times) over training episodes.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time permits, experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor), or implement an advanced RL algorithm.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that accurately reflects real-world traffic optimization goals is crucial.  Poorly designed reward functions can lead to unexpected agent behavior.
- **State Space Complexity:**  Even a simple intersection can have a surprisingly large state space.  Consider techniques like state aggregation to manage complexity if necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:**  Gain practical experience with reinforcement learning concepts, including Q-learning, environment design, and reward function engineering.
- **Simulation and Modeling:**  Develop skills in building and evaluating simple simulations for complex systems.
