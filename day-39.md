# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed streamed via WebRTC.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's view, providing its coordinates and potentially its classification confidence. This project emphasizes efficient implementation within a constrained timeframe, focusing on core functionality and leaving room for expansion.  The significance lies in demonstrating the integration of real-time streaming with computer vision techniques.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for object detection and tracking), WebRTC (using a suitable Python library like aiortc or py-webrtc), NumPy
* **Tools:**  A webcam, IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Webcam Integration:** Capture video stream from a webcam using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in each frame using OpenCV's color thresholding or MediaPipe's object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across frames using basic tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter or simple centroid tracking).
- **Coordinate Display:** Display the object's coordinates (x, y) on the video stream.
- **WebRTC Streaming:**  Stream the processed video (with overlaid coordinates) to a local webpage using WebRTC.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Object Classification (using a pre-trained model like YOLOv5 or MobileNet), more sophisticated tracking algorithms.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up WebRTC Streaming:**  Establish a basic WebRTC server and client that can transmit a webcam feed from the server to a browser.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement object detection using color thresholding (simpler) or MediaPipe (more robust) within the server-side processing loop.
3. **Object Tracking:** Integrate a basic tracking algorithm to maintain the object's position across frames.
4. **Coordinate Overlay:** Overlay the object's tracked coordinates onto the video frames.
5. **WebRTC Integration:** Integrate the processed video stream (with overlays) into the existing WebRTC stream for client-side display.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing processing speed with accuracy in object detection and tracking to maintain real-time performance. This might require optimizing code or using hardware acceleration.
- **WebRTC Complexity:** Setting up a functional WebRTC server and client can be time-consuming if not done before. Using existing readily available client code will save time.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time video processing:** Gain experience in processing video streams efficiently for real-time applications.
- **WebRTC fundamentals:** Understanding of WebRTC for real-time communication and streaming.
