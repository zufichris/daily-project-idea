# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robot Navigation

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for a robot that can generate descriptive captions for images it captures, facilitating better navigation and scene understanding.  This goes beyond simple object recognition by creating context-rich descriptions useful for decision-making in dynamic environments.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning model), transformers (for natural language processing).
- **Pre-trained Models:** A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) and a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from Hugging Face).
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook/IDE for development.

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition:**  The system should be able to capture images from a simulated or real-world camera feed (simulated is preferred for a 1-2 day project).
- **Object Detection:**  Accurately identify and locate relevant objects within the captured image.
- **Caption Generation:** Generate a human-readable caption describing the scene, including object types, their locations, and relationships.
- **Output Display:** Display the captured image along with the generated caption.
- **Data Logging:** Optionally log the image and caption pairs for later analysis and improvement.


- **Advanced Features:** Integration with a basic robot simulator (e.g., Gazebo) to test navigation based on the generated captions.
- **Optional Features:** Sentiment analysis of the caption to identify potentially hazardous or unusual situations.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries and download pre-trained models.  Choose a simulated camera feed or connect a real camera.
2. **Object Detection:** Integrate a pre-trained object detection model to identify objects in the images.
3. **Caption Generation:**  Use a pre-trained image captioning model (fine-tuning is optional but adds complexity) to generate captions based on the detected objects and their locations.
4. **Integration and Display:** Combine object detection and caption generation into a single pipeline. Display the image and caption in a user-friendly interface.
5. **Testing:** Test the system with various images and evaluate the accuracy and descriptiveness of the generated captions.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Deep learning models can be computationally expensive. Consider using optimized models or reducing image resolution if necessary.
- **Accuracy of Pre-trained Models:** Pre-trained models may not be perfectly accurate for all scenarios.  Dealing with model limitations and potential errors in object detection and caption generation is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of deep learning model integration:** This project provides practical experience in combining pre-trained models for a complex task.
- **Develop proficiency in image processing and natural language processing:** This project involves working with various libraries and techniques related to these domains.
