# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will identify pre-defined objects (e.g., a red ball, a person) within the camera's field of view and track their movement across the frame. This is a valuable foundational project for applications in robotics, surveillance, and automated systems.  The daily challenge focuses on creating a functional prototype and evaluating its performance.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Raspberry Pi:**  Model 3B+ or later recommended.
- **Python 3:**  Primary programming language.
- **OpenCV:**  For computer vision tasks (object detection and tracking).
- **TensorFlow Lite (optional):**  For deploying a pre-trained object detection model (if not using a simpler method like color thresholding).
- **Picamera:** Python library for accessing the Raspberry Pi camera.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should detect pre-defined objects in the camera feed at a frame rate sufficient for smooth tracking (at least 10 FPS).
- **Object Tracking:** The system must track the detected object(s) as they move within the frame, providing continuous position updates.
- **Visualization:** The detected objects should be highlighted in the video feed (e.g., bounding boxes).
- **Data Output:**  Optionally, the system should output the tracked object's coordinates (x, y) to a file or console.
- **Alert System (Optional):**  Trigger an alert (e.g., sound or visual signal) when a specific object enters or leaves a defined region of interest.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (`opencv-python`, `picamera`, potentially `tensorflow` or `tflite`). Test camera functionality.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement object detection using either a pre-trained model (TensorFlow Lite) or a simpler approach like color thresholding based on the chosen object(s).
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`, `cv2.TrackerKCF`) to track the detected objects across frames.
4. **Visualization and Data Output:** Overlay bounding boxes around detected objects and log the coordinates to a file (or print to the console) for analysis.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Evaluate the system's performance and refine object detection/tracking parameters as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Power:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power may limit the frame rate, especially when using complex object detection models.  Simplifying the detection method or using a more powerful Pi may be necessary.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact object detection accuracy.  Consider ways to mitigate the impact of varying light levels (e.g., adjusting detection parameters).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time computer vision:** Gain practical experience in implementing real-time object detection and tracking using OpenCV.
- **Embedded system development:**  Develop proficiency in working with a Raspberry Pi and integrating hardware and software components for a vision-based application.
