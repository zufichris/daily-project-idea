# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Simulated Robot Arm

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simple yet effective real-time object detection and tracking system for a simulated robotic arm.  The goal is to develop a system that can identify a specific object (e.g., a red cube) within a simulated environment and then guide the robotic arm to grasp and manipulate it.  This project allows for rapid prototyping and testing of computer vision and robotics algorithms within a controlled environment.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, Pygame (for visualization - optional)
* **Robotics Simulator:** PyBullet (or a similar physics engine)
* **Object Detection Model:** A pre-trained YOLOv5 model (or similar lightweight model)


## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red cube) within the simulated environment using a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position and orientation over time.
- **Arm Control:**  Command a simulated robotic arm to move towards the detected object.
- **Grasping:** Implement a simple grasping mechanism for the robotic arm to pick up the object.
- **Feedback Loop:**  Basic feedback loop to adjust the arm's position based on tracking errors.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more sophisticated grasping strategy considering object orientation and size.
- **Optional Feature:**  Add a visual interface using Pygame to display the simulated environment and tracking results.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, PyBullet, YOLOv5). Load the pre-trained object detection model and the simulated robot arm in PyBullet.
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement a loop that continuously captures frames from the simulated environment, runs object detection, and tracks the detected object using OpenCV’s tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter).
3. **Arm Control:**  Develop a control algorithm to calculate the necessary joint angles for the robotic arm to reach the detected object’s position. Send these commands to the simulated arm in PyBullet.
4. **Grasping Implementation:**  Implement a simple grasping function for the simulated arm based on the object's position and orientation.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the entire system and refine parameters (e.g., grasping position, arm movement speeds) to improve performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time object detection and control can be computationally intensive. Consider using efficient algorithms and optimizing code for speed.
- **Object Occlusion:** The object detection model might fail if the object is partially or fully occluded. Implementing strategies to handle occlusions would be an improvement.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of real-time computer vision:** This project strengthens practical knowledge of object detection, tracking, and image processing techniques.
- **Gain experience with robotics simulation and control:**  Practical application of robotics control algorithms and interaction with a physics engine like PyBullet.
