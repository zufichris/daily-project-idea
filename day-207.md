# Smart Home Device Integration via MQTT Broker

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple, yet extensible, smart home device simulator that publishes sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.) and responds to control commands via an MQTT broker. This allows for rapid prototyping of integrations with various smart home platforms without requiring actual physical hardware.  The significance lies in its ability to quickly test and debug smart home automation logic and device compatibility.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **MQTT Library:** paho-mqtt
- **JSON Library:** Python's built-in `json` library
- **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm (optional, but recommended)
- **MQTT Broker:**  Mosquitto (easily installed via package manager)


## Features & Requirements

- **Simulated Sensor Data:**  Publish temperature, humidity, and light level data to pre-defined MQTT topics at configurable intervals.
- **Command Reception:** Subscribe to MQTT topics to receive control commands (e.g., setting a target temperature).
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Log sensor data and commands to a local file for analysis.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Allow users to specify MQTT broker address, port, topics, and sensor data ranges via a configuration file (e.g., JSON).
- **Simulated Actuator Control (Optional):** Simulate the response of an actuator (e.g., a light) by publishing status updates to another MQTT topic when receiving control commands.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup MQTT Broker:** Install and start a Mosquitto broker on your local machine.
2. **Python Scripting:** Create a Python script using the `paho-mqtt` library to publish sensor data and subscribe to command topics.  Implement basic sensor data generation (random values within specified ranges).
3. **Configuration:**  Implement a configuration file (JSON) to manage MQTT connection details, topics, and sensor ranges. Allow parameters to be easily modified without code changes.
4. **Command Handling:**  Write logic to process received commands, updating simulated sensor values or actuator states appropriately.
5. **(Optional) Data Logging:** Implement logging to write sensor data and commands to a file for later review.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial for MQTT connections and command processing. Implement proper exception handling to manage disconnections and invalid commands.
- **Data Validation:**  Validate received commands to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.


## Learning Outcomes

- **MQTT Protocol:**  Gain practical experience with the MQTT protocol for device-to-device communication.
- **Sensor Data Simulation:** Develop skills in simulating sensor data for testing and development purposes.
