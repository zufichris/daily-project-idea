# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a traffic intersection with intelligent traffic light control, adapting to real-time traffic flow using a simplified algorithm.  The goal is to build a basic, visual simulation that demonstrates the concept of optimizing traffic flow through dynamic signal timing. This is a valuable exercise in algorithm design, data visualization, and event-driven programming.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Tools:** A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements
- **Basic Traffic Simulation:** Simulate vehicles arriving at and traversing the intersection from all four directions.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light system with a fixed timing cycle initially.
- **Vehicle Detection:** Simulate vehicle detection using random number generation or simple logic to represent sensors.
- **Visualization:** Display the traffic flow and traffic light states graphically using Pygame.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track and display basic metrics like average wait time and throughput.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a rudimentary adaptive traffic light control algorithm (e.g., simple priority based on detected vehicle density).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Introduce different vehicle types (cars, trucks) with varying speeds and turning behaviors.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Basic Structure:** Create the Pygame window and set up basic elements (road, traffic lights).  Implement initial vehicle generation and movement.
2. **Fixed-Time Traffic Control:** Implement a simple traffic light timer that cycles through green, yellow, and red states for each direction.
3. **Vehicle Detection & Simulation:** Introduce basic vehicle detection using random number generation.  Refine vehicle movement to respond to traffic signals.
4. **Visualization & Metrics:** Display the simulation in real-time.  Implement basic metrics like average wait time and cars passed through the intersection per cycle.
5. **Adaptive Control (Optional):** Implement a basic algorithm that adjusts traffic light timing based on the number of vehicles detected in each direction.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm Design:** Developing a robust yet simple adaptive traffic light control algorithm within the time constraint.  A straightforward approach like prioritizing the direction with the highest vehicle density is sufficient for this challenge.
- **Visualization Performance:**  Maintaining a smooth frame rate with a high number of vehicles.  Consider optimizing drawing routines if performance becomes an issue.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Algorithm Design:** Practice designing and implementing a simple control algorithm for a dynamic system.
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Reinforce skills in handling events and managing multiple simultaneous processes using Pygame's event handling mechanisms.
