# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The goal is to build a functional prototype capable of identifying and tracking a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's view. This project focuses on leveraging existing libraries and minimizing unnecessary complexities to allow for a rapid prototype within a day or two.  It provides a practical application of computer vision concepts.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam or video file.  A suitable IDE (PyCharm, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Acquire video frames from a webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., color-based) within the frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across consecutive frames.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Overlay a bounding box around the tracked object on the video feed.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) achieved for performance monitoring.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):** Implement a more robust object detection algorithm (e.g., using Haar cascades or a pre-trained deep learning model).
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Add object classification capabilities beyond simple color detection.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`). Set up the project environment and import required libraries.
2. **Video Capture & Preprocessing:**  Establish a connection to the webcam and begin capturing frames.  Consider resizing frames for performance optimization.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm (e.g., using `cv2.inRange()`). Utilize techniques like optical flow or Kalman filtering for tracking (simpler methods preferred for daily scope).
4. **Bounding Box & FPS Display:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object.  Calculate and display the FPS using `cv2.putText()`.
5. **Output & Refinement:** Display the processed video feed.  Iterate and refine the detection/tracking parameters to optimize performance and accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly impact color-based object detection.  Consider using techniques to mitigate this (e.g., adaptive thresholding).
- **Occlusion:** If the object is temporarily occluded, the tracking algorithm might lose it. Implementing a more robust tracking algorithm can alleviate this (though this is optional for the daily challenge).

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of OpenCV:** Gain hands-on experience with core OpenCV functions for video processing, object detection, and display.
- **Understand real-time constraints:** Appreciate the challenges of processing video data in real time and techniques for optimizing performance (e.g., frame resizing, efficient algorithms).
