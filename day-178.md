# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling smart home devices using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model.  The focus will be on creating a simple, functional system that can be expanded upon later.  This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and its integration with existing smart home ecosystems.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe,  requests (for API interaction)
- **Hardware:** Webcam (or compatible camera),  (Optional: Raspberry Pi for a standalone solution)
- **Smart Home Platform:**  IFTTT, Home Assistant API (choose one based on familiarity)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately identify predefined gestures (e.g., hand open/close, wave, thumbs up/down) from the webcam feed.
- **Device Control Mapping:**  Each recognized gesture should trigger a specific action on a chosen smart home device (e.g., turning on/off a light, adjusting thermostat).
- **User Interface:**  A simple visual interface (optional, can be a terminal output initially) indicating which gesture is detected and the corresponding action taken.
- **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of situations where a gesture is not recognized or the smart home API request fails.
- **Configuration:** Ability to easily map gestures to specific smart home device controls and actions.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment & Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, requests).  Test webcam functionality with OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Implement a basic gesture recognition pipeline using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution.  Focus on a small set of easily distinguishable gestures.
3. **Smart Home API Integration:**  Choose a smart home platform (IFTTT or Home Assistant) and set up API keys/credentials.  Write functions to send control commands to your chosen devices.
4. **Gesture-Action Mapping:**  Connect the output of the gesture recognition to the smart home API control functions.  Implement error handling to catch API failures.
5. **Basic UI (Optional):** Create a simple UI (e.g., using OpenCV's display functions or a basic GUI library) to visualize the detected gestures and the corresponding actions performed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand positioning, and background clutter can affect the accuracy of MediaPipe's hand tracking. Consider adding preprocessing steps to improve robustness.
- **Smart Home API Limitations:**  Different smart home platforms have varying API capabilities and response times.  Thoroughly understand the chosen API's limitations and incorporate error handling appropriately.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  Gain experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time object detection and tracking.
- **Integration with External APIs:**  Learn how to interact with external services (e.g., smart home platforms) through their APIs, including handling API requests and responses.
