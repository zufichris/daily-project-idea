# Automated Code Style Checker with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to develop a customizable code style checker that analyzes Python code and reports style violations based on a user-defined rule set. This is significant because maintaining consistent code style across large projects is crucial for readability, maintainability, and collaboration.  A quickly-prototyped tool allows for rapid iteration and testing of various stylistic preferences.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) library
- `argparse` (for command-line argument parsing)
- Text editor/IDE (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Optional:  A lightweight testing framework (like `pytest`)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - Parse Python code using the `ast` module.
    - Define a set of customizable style rules (e.g., maximum line length, indentation, spacing around operators).
    - Identify violations against the defined rules.
    - Generate a report listing the violations with line numbers and descriptions.
    - Accept a configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) to specify the rules.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Integrate with a linter like `pylint` or `flake8` for more comprehensive checks.
    - Allow for severity levels for different rule violations.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Rule Definition:** Create a data structure (e.g., dictionary or class) to represent the customizable style rules.  Start with a few basic rules (line length, indentation).
2. **AST Parsing & Rule Enforcement:** Implement functions that traverse the AST and check for violations against the defined rules.  Use the `ast` module's visitor pattern or recursive functions.
3. **Report Generation:** Create a function to format the detected violations into a user-friendly report (printed to the console initially).
4. **Configuration Loading:** Add functionality to load rules from a configuration file (e.g., JSON) for flexibility and reusability.
5. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Use `argparse` to create a simple CLI that accepts the input Python file and the configuration file path.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Complex AST Structures:**  Dealing with nested structures and different types of Python code constructs can be complex.  Start with simpler rules and gradually add more sophisticated ones.
- **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling is essential to manage cases such as invalid input files or improperly formatted configuration files.  Use `try-except` blocks effectively.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of the `ast` module:** Gain hands-on experience with parsing and manipulating Python code using abstract syntax trees.
- **Improve skills in code analysis and static analysis:**  Develop proficiency in analyzing code for style and potential issues without actually running the code.
