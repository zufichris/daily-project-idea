# Intelligent Room Lighting Control using Ambient Sound

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart lighting system that adjusts room illumination based on detected ambient sound levels.  The system will use a microphone to capture sound, process it to determine the intensity, and then dynamically adjust connected LED lights accordingly. This offers a unique, context-aware approach to lighting control, potentially improving ambiance and energy efficiency.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyAudio (for audio input), NumPy (for numerical computation), RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi GPIO control, if using a physical prototype),  requests (for potential cloud integration).
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi, LEDs, resistors, breadboard, microphone.  A simple simulation without hardware is also feasible.
- **Software:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Sound Level Detection:**  The system accurately measures the ambient sound level in decibels (dB).
- **Lighting Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the brightness of connected LEDs based on the detected sound level.  A simple linear mapping from dB to brightness is sufficient.
- **Threshold Configuration:** Users can set minimum and maximum sound levels and corresponding brightness levels.
- **Real-time Response:** The system responds to changes in sound levels with minimal delay.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  The system logs sound levels and light adjustments for analysis and improvement.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Sound Input & Processing:** Implement a function using PyAudio to capture audio input from the microphone.  Calculate the root mean square (RMS) amplitude to represent the sound level.
2. **Mapping & Control:** Create a mapping function to translate the RMS amplitude into a brightness value for the LEDs. This can be a simple linear scale or a more complex curve.  If using hardware, implement GPIO control to adjust LED brightness accordingly.
3. **Threshold Implementation:** Implement user configurable minimum and maximum sound levels and corresponding brightness levels.
4. **User Interface (Optional):** Create a simple text-based or GUI interface for setting thresholds.
5. **Data Logging (Optional):** Implement data logging to a file or database if time permits.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Noise Reduction:**  Filtering out background noise to improve accuracy of sound level measurement.  Simple moving averages or more sophisticated noise reduction techniques can be employed.
- **Hardware Integration (if applicable):**  Correctly interfacing with the Raspberry Pi GPIO and LEDs requires attention to detail and careful wiring.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Signal Processing:** Gain practical experience in working with audio input and processing signals to extract relevant information.
- **Real-time System Design:** Develop skills in designing and implementing a system that responds dynamically to changing input in real-time.
