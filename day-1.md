# Self-Calibrating Robotic Gripper Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple robotic gripper control system that incorporates self-calibration to compensate for variations in grip force and object size.  The goal is to create a robust and adaptable gripper control algorithm that can be implemented and tested within a short timeframe. This has applications in automated manufacturing, pick-and-place robotics, and assistive robotics.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for optimization), PySerial (for serial communication with microcontroller)
* **Hardware:**  A small robotic gripper (e.g., a commercially available one with serial control), a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino), a force sensor (optional, but highly recommended), computer with serial port access.


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Gripper Control:**  Ability to open and close the gripper via serial communication.
- **Force Feedback Integration (if force sensor is used):** The system should read force sensor data and use it to adjust the grip strength.
- **Self-Calibration Routine:** Implement a simple algorithm to calibrate the gripper's grip force based on initial force readings during a calibration sequence.
- **Object Size Estimation (optional):** Incorporate a rudimentary object size estimation based on initial grip closure data (e.g., using sensor data for position).
- **Data Logging:** Log grip force, object size (if estimated), and other relevant data for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup & Serial Communication:** Connect the gripper to the microcontroller, and the microcontroller to the computer. Verify serial communication using a simple test program.
2. **Basic Gripper Control Implementation:**  Write Python code to send commands to the gripper (open, close) via serial.
3. **Force Feedback Integration (if applicable):** Integrate force sensor data into the control loop to adjust grip based on target force.
4. **Self-Calibration Algorithm:** Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., linear regression) to calibrate the gripper's force based on the initial readings during calibration.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the self-calibration routine with different objects and refine the algorithm as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Noise in Sensor Data:** Sensor readings can be noisy. Implementing filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) is crucial for robustness.
- **Calibration Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the self-calibration depends on the sensor quality and the calibration algorithm's design.  A simple approach may be sufficient for a quick prototype.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Control Systems:**  This project reinforces understanding of closed-loop control systems and feedback mechanisms.
- **Embedded Systems Integration:**  It provides experience integrating software with hardware (microcontroller) via serial communication.
