# Mini-Game AI: Reinforcement Learning for Simple 2D Maze Navigation

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple 2D maze navigation game with an AI agent that learns to solve the maze using reinforcement learning. The focus is on a quick implementation and demonstration of basic RL concepts, rather than a highly sophisticated AI. This allows for a tangible prototype within a day or two.  The significance lies in understanding the core principles of reinforcement learning in a practical context.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development and visualization), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning) or a simpler library like Stable Baselines3.  NumPy for numerical computation.

## Features & Requirements
- **Maze Generation:** A simple algorithm to generate random mazes of a specified size.
- **Agent Movement:** The AI agent can move up, down, left, and right within the maze.
- **Reward System:** A reward mechanism that provides positive reinforcement for reaching the goal and negative reinforcement for hitting walls.
- **Training Loop:**  A training loop that iteratively updates the AI agent's policy based on its experiences.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the agent navigating the maze.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of a more sophisticated maze generation algorithm (e.g., recursive backtracker).  Incorporating different types of terrain with varying movement costs.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Maze Generation & Visualization:**  Implement a simple maze generation algorithm (e.g., random wall generation) and display it using Pygame.
2. **Agent & Movement:** Create the AI agent and implement basic movement functionality within the maze boundaries.
3. **Reward Function & State Representation:** Define a reward function (e.g., +1 for reaching the goal, -0.1 for each step) and represent the agent's state (e.g., its coordinates).
4. **Reinforcement Learning Implementation:** Use a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler approach from Stable Baselines3) to train the agent.  Focus on a short training period for a daily challenge.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate the trained agent into the game and observe its performance in solving the maze.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  Reinforcement learning can be computationally expensive.  Simplifying the maze and using a less complex algorithm might be necessary to achieve results within the time constraint.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the RL algorithm might require some experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and adjust based on observations.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning principles.
- Experience with game development using Pygame and integrating AI.
- Understanding of the trade-offs between algorithm complexity and computational resources in AI.
