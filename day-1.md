# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition. This allows for a more intuitive and contactless interaction with smart home devices, enhancing user experience and accessibility.  The focus will be on a minimal viable product (MVP) demonstrating core functionality within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision and image processing), MediaPipe (for hand gesture recognition),  a suitable library for interacting with the target smart appliance (e.g., Home Assistant API if using a smart lamp).
- **Hardware:** A webcam (built-in or external) and the target smart home appliance.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE for development.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Detection:** The system must accurately detect and track a user's hand in real-time using the webcam.
- **Gesture Recognition:** The system should recognize predefined gestures (e.g., hand open for "on," hand closed for "off," a wave for "dim").
- **Appliance Control:**  The system should send commands to the smart appliance based on the recognized gestures.
- **Calibration:**  An initial calibration step to adjust for lighting conditions and hand size.
- **Error Handling:**  Basic error handling for situations where hand detection fails.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Multiple gesture support for different appliance functions (e.g., brightness control), user profile management for personalized gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, and appliance API library).  Set up the development environment (Jupyter Notebook).
2. **Hand Detection & Tracking:** Implement hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe.  Test the accuracy and robustness of the hand tracking module.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Define gestures and implement the logic to recognize them based on hand landmark positions provided by MediaPipe.
4. **Appliance Control Integration:** Integrate with the smart appliance API to send control commands based on recognized gestures. Test the complete system.
5. **Refinement & Testing:** Test the system's responsiveness and accuracy under varying lighting conditions and hand positions. Refine the gesture recognition algorithms as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact hand detection accuracy. Robust algorithms and potential lighting compensation techniques should be considered.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Similar hand positions could lead to ambiguous gesture interpretations. Careful selection of gestures and robust classification algorithms are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience in real-time computer vision using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
-  Learn how to integrate computer vision with a smart home system using API calls.
- Understand the challenges and considerations in developing robust gesture recognition systems.
