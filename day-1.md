#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a streamlined calibration procedure for a miniature robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to create a system that can quickly and accurately determine the arm's kinematics parameters (link lengths, joint angles) using a camera and image processing techniques. This is crucial for ensuring precise movement and repeatable accuracy in small-scale robotic applications.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), possibly a robotics library like ROS (Robot Operating System) if time permits for more complex arm control.
* **Hardware:** A miniature robotic arm (e.g., a 3-DOF or 4-DOF kit), a webcam or similar camera, a computer.
* **Software:** A suitable IDE like PyCharm or VS Code.


## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:**  Calibrate the camera to obtain intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients).
- **Target Detection:** Detect and locate a known target (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) in the camera's field of view.
- **Forward Kinematics Calculation:** Given joint angles, calculate the end-effector position using forward kinematics equations (this assumes the robot's kinematic model is known).
- **Inverse Kinematics Estimation (optional):**  Estimate the inverse kinematics, i.e., calculate joint angles given the desired end-effector position (more challenging, possibly only achievable with simplified models).
- **Calibration Visualization:** Display the calculated parameters and the arm's pose in a visual representation (e.g., using OpenCV's drawing functions).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function with images of a checkerboard pattern to obtain camera intrinsic parameters.
2. **Target Detection & Tracking:** Detect the checkerboard in real-time using OpenCV's feature detection and matching algorithms. Track the target as the robotic arm moves.
3. **Data Acquisition:** Capture images of the checkerboard at multiple known joint angles of the arm. Record these joint angles alongside their corresponding pixel coordinates in the images.
4. **Calibration Algorithm:** Develop a simple algorithm (e.g., least-squares fitting) to estimate the arm's kinematic parameters based on the collected data.
5. **Visualization and Evaluation:** Visualize the calculated parameters and test the calibration's accuracy by commanding the arm to specific positions and comparing the actual vs. expected end-effector location.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of the miniature robotic arm:** Miniature arms often have higher levels of backlash and less precision than their larger counterparts, leading to calibration errors. This can be addressed by averaging multiple measurements.
- **Computational complexity:** Inverse kinematics can be computationally expensive, especially for complex robotic arm models.  Simplifying the arm model or using iterative methods might be necessary for a daily challenge scope.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:**  This project enhances practical skills in camera calibration, feature detection, and image processing.
- **Apply knowledge of robotics kinematics:** This project strengthens understanding of forward and possibly inverse kinematics, and the importance of accurate calibration in robotics.
