# Optimized Image Compression for Embedded Systems

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a lightweight image compression algorithm optimized for resource-constrained embedded systems.  Many embedded devices, like microcontrollers in IoT applications, lack the processing power for standard compression techniques like JPEG. This project aims to create a faster, smaller footprint algorithm suitable for real-time image processing on such devices.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** C++ (for performance and memory efficiency)
- **IDE:**  PlatformIO or similar embedded development environment
- **Libraries:**  None required for a core implementation; optional libraries for testing and image I/O (e.g., OpenCV might be used for image loading/saving on a host PC for testing).
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A microcontroller development board (e.g., ESP32, Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense) for testing the final implementation.


## Features & Requirements

- **Lossy Compression:**  The algorithm should prioritize speed and compression ratio over perfect image fidelity.
- **Adaptive Quantization:**  The quantization step should be dynamically adjusted based on image content for better compression.
- **Simple Encoding/Decoding:** The compression and decompression methods must be computationally inexpensive.
- **Configurable Compression Level:** Allow users to specify a compression level affecting speed and size trade-off.
- **Output to Raw Data:** The compressed image should be output as a raw byte stream for direct storage and processing on the embedded system.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple error diffusion dithering algorithm to minimize artifacts.
- **Advanced Feature:** Explore adaptive block size for compression based on image complexity.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Algorithm Design:**  Choose a simple, fast compression algorithm like a modified version of a run-length encoding (RLE) algorithm or a basic predictive coding approach suited for grayscale images.
2. **C++ Implementation:**  Implement the chosen algorithm in C++, focusing on memory management and efficiency.  Test extensively with sample images on a PC.
3. **Quantization Implementation:** Integrate adaptive quantization based on image statistics (e.g., standard deviation of pixel values within blocks).
4. **Testing and Optimization:**  Test the algorithm's performance (compression ratio, speed) using different images and compression levels. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
5. **(Optional) Embedded System Deployment:**  If a microcontroller is available, port the code and test on the target hardware.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Memory Constraints:** Embedded systems have limited RAM; efficient memory management is crucial.  Consider using bit manipulation techniques to reduce memory usage.
- **Computational Power:**  The algorithm must be extremely efficient to execute quickly on low-power devices. Careful algorithm selection and code optimization are paramount.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Reinforces skills in writing efficient, memory-conscious C++ code for resource-constrained environments.
- **Image Processing Algorithms:** Develops understanding of image compression techniques and the trade-offs between speed, compression ratio, and image quality.
