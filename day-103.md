# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, game AI using reinforcement learning (RL) within a limited timeframe. The focus will be on rapid prototyping and experimentation, demonstrating the core concepts of RL in a practical context.  The game will be a simplified version of a classic game, allowing for quick iterations and observable results.  The significance lies in showcasing the power of RL in creating adaptive AI behaviors within a constrained development period.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar)
* **Game Engine/Library:** Pygame (for simplicity)
* **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a maze navigation or a simple arcade game).
- **RL Agent:** An RL agent trained using a chosen algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
- **Reward System:** A well-defined reward function guiding the agent's learning.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Ability to train the agent and observe its performance in the game.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the agent's actions and learning progress.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporate a basic form of opponent AI for a more complex game scenario.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Experiment with different RL algorithms to compare their performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Design and implement the basic game environment using Pygame. Focus on a simple, easily modifiable design.
2. **RL Agent Integration:** Integrate the chosen RL library (Stable Baselines3) and define the agent's action space, observation space, and reward function.
3. **Training Loop:**  Implement a training loop that iteratively interacts with the environment, trains the agent, and logs performance metrics.  Limit the number of training iterations to achieve progress within the timeframe.
4. **Visualization:** Create a visualization to display the game state and the agent's actions during training and evaluation.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance against predefined metrics (e.g., average reward, success rate).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards desired behavior can be challenging and might require iterative adjustments.  Start with a simple reward function and refine as needed.
- **Training Time:** Reinforcement learning can be computationally expensive.  Careful selection of the RL algorithm and hyperparameters is crucial to ensure sufficient progress within the time constraint.  Prioritize a fast-converging algorithm like PPO and limit training iterations.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts, including state, action, reward, policy, and the training process.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Gain hands-on experience using a popular RL library like Stable Baselines3, enhancing proficiency in implementing and applying RL algorithms.
