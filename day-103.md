# Efficient Pathfinding for a Simulated Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated robot navigating a dynamic obstacle course.  The goal is to create a system that can quickly and efficiently find a collision-free path, showcasing real-world robotics challenges in a manageable, daily-scale project.  This allows exploration of different pathfinding algorithms and their performance characteristics.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for visualization and simulation), NetworkX (optional, for graph-based pathfinding)
- Algorithm: A* Search (with potential for comparison against Dijkstra's algorithm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Generation:**  Random generation of static and dynamic obstacles within a defined environment.
- **Pathfinding:** Implementation of the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from a start to a goal point, avoiding obstacles.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the robot's movement, obstacles, and the calculated path using Pygame.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:**  The algorithm should adapt to moving obstacles, recalculating the path as needed.
- **Performance Measurement:**  Track the time taken to find a path and the path length.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementation of a heuristic function beyond Manhattan distance for improved A* performance.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Integration with a simple physics engine to simulate robot movement constraints (e.g., turning radius).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the Pygame window and initialize the environment (size, start/goal points). Generate a set of static obstacles.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* search algorithm with a suitable heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan distance).  Focus on efficient data structures for open and closed lists.
3. **Path Visualization:**  Visualize the generated path and the robot's movement along it within the Pygame window.
4. **Dynamic Obstacle Integration:** Add functionality to introduce moving obstacles and trigger path recalculation when necessary.  Consider using a simple approach like obstacle movement prediction.
5. **Performance Testing:**  Measure the time taken to find paths and the path lengths for different obstacle densities and moving obstacle speeds.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Optimization:**  Ensuring efficient implementation of the A* algorithm to handle a large number of obstacles without significant performance degradation.  This might involve optimizing data structures or heuristic functions.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Prediction:**  Accurately predicting the movement of dynamic obstacles to avoid collisions efficiently can be challenging. Simple prediction models might suffice for this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Pathfinding Algorithms:**  This project provides hands-on experience in implementing and optimizing a classic pathfinding algorithm like A*.
- **Understanding Dynamic Systems:** This project enhances understanding of how to handle changes and uncertainties in a simulated robotic environment, crucial in real-world applications.
