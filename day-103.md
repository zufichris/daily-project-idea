# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures. The system will leverage readily available hardware and software libraries to achieve a basic level of functionality within a short timeframe.  This demonstrates a fusion of interaction modalities for enhanced usability and accessibility.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyAudio (audio input), TensorFlow Lite (for gesture recognition model), SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text), a suitable library for controlling the specific smart appliance (e.g., a library for controlling Philips Hue lights or a generic MQTT client).
* **Hardware:** A microphone (built-in or external), a webcam (optional, for gesture recognition), and the target smart home appliance.
* **Optional:** Raspberry Pi (for a more embedded solution) or a cloud-based machine learning service for the gesture recognition model.

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to basic voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the lamp," "Increase brightness," "Decrease brightness."
- **Gesture Control:** The system should recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., wave for on/off, hand raise for brightness increase, hand lower for brightness decrease) using a pre-trained or simple custom-trained model.
- **Appliance Integration:** Seamless integration with a chosen smart home appliance.  The system should send appropriate commands to change the appliance's state based on voice and gesture input.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle invalid voice commands or gesture recognition failures.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide visual or auditory feedback (e.g., a console message or a sound effect) to indicate successful command execution.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Multi-appliance control: Extend functionality to control multiple appliances.
- Customizable voice commands and gesture mappings.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary Python libraries and configure the hardware (microphone, webcam if used).
2. **Voice Recognition:** Integrate SpeechRecognition to transcribe voice input and parse commands.  Implement logic to trigger appliance control based on recognized commands.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** If using a webcam, either utilize a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for gesture recognition or train a very simple model for a limited set of gestures. Integrate the model to control the appliance based on detected gestures.  Alternatively, use a simpler method like detecting hand movement thresholds in a video stream for a proof-of-concept.
4. **Appliance Control:**  Implement the communication layer to send control signals to the smart home appliance. This will depend on the appliance's API or communication protocol.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly and refine voice and gesture recognition accuracy as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech and Gesture Recognition:**  The accuracy of speech-to-text and gesture recognition might be limited, especially with noisy environments or varied gestures. Employ robust error handling and consider methods to improve accuracy.
- **Appliance API Compatibility:**  The chosen smart appliance's API or control mechanism may present integration challenges.  Prior research on the target appliance's documentation is crucial.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience in integrating multiple input modalities (voice and gesture) into a single application.
- Develop skills in using machine learning libraries (TensorFlow Lite) for real-time applications, even with simplified models.
