# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection controlled by an intelligent traffic light system. The simulation will utilize a basic reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize traffic flow and minimize wait times.  The focus will be on creating a functional prototype that demonstrates the core concepts within a short timeframe.  This is significant as it provides a hands-on experience with reinforcement learning in a practical application.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Pygame (for visualization), a reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3)


## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Generation:**  Simulate vehicles arriving at the intersection with varying arrival rates and directions.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light system with customizable timing.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Train a basic RL agent (e.g., Q-learning) to optimize traffic light switching based on simulated vehicle queues.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track metrics such as average wait time and throughput.
- **Visualization:** Display the simulation visually using Pygame, showing vehicle movements and traffic light states.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate different vehicle types with varying speeds. Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Create the simulation environment using Pygame. Define the intersection layout, vehicle generation parameters, and traffic light states.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm and define the state space (e.g., vehicle queues at each approach), action space (traffic light states), reward function (e.g., negative wait time), and training parameters.
3. **Agent Training:** Train the RL agent using a simplified traffic scenario. Monitor performance metrics during training.
4. **Simulation & Visualization:** Integrate the trained agent into the simulation and visualize the traffic flow and traffic light switching.
5. **Evaluation & Refinement:** Evaluate the performance of the system based on the collected metrics.  Iterate on the agent's parameters or algorithm if necessary.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Simulation Complexity:**  Finding the right balance between realism and computational tractability within a limited time frame will be challenging.  Start with a highly simplified model and add complexity iteratively.
- **RL Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate RL algorithm for the given problem and optimizing its hyperparameters efficiently requires experience.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Gain practical experience in implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent for a real-world problem.
- **Simulation Development:** Enhance skills in creating and visualizing a discrete-event simulation.
