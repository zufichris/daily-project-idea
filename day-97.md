# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet functional real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi and a readily available webcam.  The system will detect, track, and classify objects within the camera's field of view, providing a foundation for more complex applications like security monitoring or robotics.  The daily challenge lies in creating a functional prototype that can identify and track at least two distinct object categories in real-time.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for object detection), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB Webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system must detect objects within the camera's field of view in real-time.
- **Object Classification:** The system should classify detected objects into pre-defined categories (e.g., "person," "car").
- **Object Tracking:** The system should track the identified objects as they move within the frame.
- **Frame Rate Optimization:** The system should strive for a reasonable frame rate (e.g., 10-15 FPS) to ensure smooth tracking.
- **Visual Output:**  Display the processed video stream with bounding boxes and class labels overlaid on detected objects.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement distance estimation using object dimensions and camera calibration. Integrate a simple alert system (e.g., sound or LED) triggered by specific object detections.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, NumPy) on the Raspberry Pi. Download a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite object detection model for the desired object categories.
2. **Camera Input and Preprocessing:**  Use OpenCV to capture video from the webcam.  Preprocess the frames (resize, convert color space if needed) for efficient processing.
3. **Object Detection and Classification:** Utilize the TensorFlow Lite model to perform object detection and classification on each frame.  Extract bounding box coordinates and class labels.
4. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple object tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.track` functions or a custom approach based on bounding box centroid tracking) to maintain object identification across frames.
5. **Output and Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and class labels onto the video stream using OpenCV's drawing functions. Display the resulting video.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the frame rate and the complexity of the object detection model that can be used. Optimizing the model and preprocessing steps is crucial.
- **Accuracy and Robustness:** The accuracy of object detection and tracking can be affected by lighting conditions, object occlusion, and the quality of the pre-trained model.  Careful model selection and potential parameter tuning might be needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of Computer Vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience with real-time object detection, classification, and tracking using OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite.
- **Gain experience with embedded system development:** Working with the Raspberry Pi provides valuable experience in deploying and optimizing computer vision algorithms on resource-constrained hardware.
