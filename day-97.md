#  Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control (Miniature)

## Overview
This project aims to build a miniature self-balancing robot arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller.  The challenge lies in implementing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm to maintain balance while the arm is extended or manipulated.  This project demonstrates fundamental robotics control principles in a compact, easily prototyped format.

## Technologies & Tools
- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano or similar
- Servo Motor:  Small, high-torque servo (e.g., TowerPro SG90)
- Accelerometer/Gyroscope: MPU6050 or similar IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- Programming Language: Arduino IDE (C++)
- Optional: 3D-printed or laser-cut base for the arm

## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should remain upright despite external disturbances.
- **Angle Control:**  The ability to manually set a target angle for the arm using potentiometer or serial input.
- **PID Control Implementation:** Accurate PID tuning for optimal stability.
- **Sensor Data Visualization:** Optionally display sensor readings (angle, acceleration) on a serial monitor.
- **Automatic Zeroing:**  The system should automatically detect and adjust for its upright position.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a basic "reach" functionality â€“ the arm extends to a target position while maintaining balance.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporate a simple object recognition system (e.g., using a distance sensor) to avoid collisions.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the servo motor, IMU, and potentiometer (if used) to the microcontroller according to the respective datasheets.  Assemble the mechanical structure of the arm (simple design is sufficient).
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the IMU to obtain accurate angle readings relative to the vertical axis. This may involve finding the offset values.
3. **PID Algorithm Implementation:** Write the PID control loop in Arduino C++. This will read IMU data, calculate the error between current and desired angle, and adjust the servo motor accordingly.
4. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the arm's balance and refine PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) to optimize stability.  Start with low values for Kp, Ki, and Kd and gradually increase them.
5. **Advanced Functionality (Optional):** If time permits, implement the selected advanced features.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:**  Finding the optimal PID parameters can be time-consuming and require iterative adjustments. Use trial and error, keeping a record of the values tested.
- **IMU Noise:** Real-world IMU data is noisy. Filtering techniques (like a moving average filter) may improve accuracy and stability.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of PID control algorithms and their implementation in a real-world context.
- Practical experience with sensor integration, data acquisition, and control systems in robotics.
