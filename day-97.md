# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game using reinforcement learning (RL).  The focus will be on a fast prototyping approach, leveraging existing RL libraries to achieve a functional AI within a short timeframe.  The game chosen will be a simplified version of tic-tac-toe or a similar game with a small state space, allowing for faster training and iteration. This demonstrates practical RL application in a concise and manageable project.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- RL Library: Stable Baselines3 (or similar)
- Game Engine/Library: Pygame (or a simple custom implementation for tic-tac-toe)
- IDE:  VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A functional game environment (tic-tac-toe or similar).
    - An RL agent trained using a chosen algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C).
    - The ability to play against the AI agent.
    - Basic visualization of the game state and agent's actions.
    - Recording of win/loss/draw statistics for the AI agent.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a different RL algorithm for comparison.
    - Adding a user interface with more sophisticated visual elements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Create the game environment using Pygame (or a custom implementation).  Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Choose and Implement RL Algorithm:** Select an appropriate RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) from Stable Baselines3 and integrate it with the game environment.
3. **Train the Agent:** Train the RL agent for a pre-defined number of iterations or until a satisfactory performance level is reached.  Monitor performance metrics.
4. **Implement Game Play:**  Add functionality for a human player to interact with the game and play against the AI agent.
5. **Evaluate and Refine:** Evaluate the AI agent's performance. If time permits, adjust hyperparameters or the RL algorithm to improve performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Training Time and Performance:**  Finding the right balance between training time and achieving a reasonably strong AI agent within the time constraint.  This might involve simplifying the game or using a faster RL algorithm.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal agent behavior. Careful consideration is needed to ensure the reward function guides the agent towards desired actions.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning principles in a real-world (game-based) context.
- Hands-on experience with RL libraries like Stable Baselines3 and its integration with game development.
- Understanding of hyperparameter tuning and its impact on RL agent performance.
