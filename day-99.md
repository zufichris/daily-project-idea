# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simplified calibration system for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to create a quick and efficient method to accurately determine the robot's end-effector position in 3D space, without relying on complex factory calibration procedures.  This is significant because accurate calibration is crucial for precise robotic manipulation tasks.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot Magician, UR3e - simulation acceptable for a daily challenge)
- A calibrated camera (or simulated camera parameters)

## Features & Requirements
- **Target Detection:**  Detect a known-size target (e.g., a checkerboard) placed at various locations within the robot's workspace using OpenCV.
- **3D Position Calculation:**  Calculate the 3D coordinates of the target relative to the camera using computer vision techniques (e.g., solving PnP problem).
- **Robot Arm Movement:** Command the robotic arm to move to the calculated 3D coordinates.
- **Error Measurement:**  Measure the difference between the commanded position and the actual position of the robot's end-effector (requires some feedback mechanism on the arm or simulation).
- **Calibration Parameter Adjustment (Optional):** Implement a basic iterative calibration method to adjust internal parameters based on the error measurement.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a visual servoing loop for refined positioning.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Utilize a more robust feature detection algorithm (e.g., SIFT, SURF) for less ideal lighting or target conditions.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Target Detection:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. Implement OpenCV code to detect the checkerboard target in the camera feed.
2. **3D Position Calculation (PnP):** Use OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to calculate the 3D position of the target from the 2D image points and camera parameters.
3. **Robot Arm Control:** Integrate the calculated 3D position with the robotic arm's API to move the end-effector to the target location.
4. **Error Measurement:** Measure the difference between the commanded position and the actual end-effector position. This may require additional sensors on the robotic arm or reliance on simulated feedback.
5. **(Optional) Iterative Calibration:** If time permits, develop a simple iterative loop to adjust calibration parameters based on the observed error.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Camera Calibration:** Accurate camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are crucial.  Pre-calibrated cameras are highly recommended to save time; otherwise, camera calibration will be a significant portion of the project.
- **Robot Arm Accuracy and Precision:** The accuracy of the robotic arm itself will limit the precision of the calibration.  Simulation may allow for more controlled experimentation in a short timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of computer vision techniques (feature detection, 3D reconstruction, PnP problem).
- Practical application of robotics control and integration with computer vision algorithms.
