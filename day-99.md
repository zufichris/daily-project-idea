# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated two-wheeled self-balancing robot.  The goal is to create a stable control system that keeps the robot upright despite disturbances.  This is a common robotics challenge ideal for illustrating fundamental control system concepts within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- **Simulation Environment:**  A simple physics engine like Pygame or a dedicated robotics simulator (e.g., PyBullet, if time permits).  A minimal simulation will suffice for this daily challenge.

## Features & Requirements

- **Robot Model:** A simplified two-wheeled inverted pendulum model with basic physics (gravity, inertia).
- **PID Controller Implementation:**  A functioning PID controller to adjust motor speeds based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
- **Sensor Simulation:**  Simulated sensors providing angle and angular velocity data.
- **Motor Control Simulation:**  Simulated motors responding to control signals.
- **Stabilization:**  The robot should maintain its upright position despite initial disturbances (e.g., small pushes).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of a Kalman filter for sensor fusion (if time and expertise allow).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Adding noise to the sensor data to test the robustness of the PID controller.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Robot Model & Simulation:** Create a simplified robot model using Pygame or another chosen simulation environment.  This involves defining the robot's physical properties and simulating its motion under gravity.
2. **Sensor & Motor Simulation:** Implement simulated sensors (angle, angular velocity) and motors.  Keep the simulation as simple as possible for a daily challenge.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Write a Python function implementing the PID algorithm.  Initialize the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) with initial values.
4. **Control Loop:** Integrate the PID controller into the simulation.  The controller receives sensor data, calculates control signals, and sends them to the simulated motors.
5. **PID Tuning:**  Iteratively adjust the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal performance (stability and responsiveness). Use visualization to observe the robot's behavior and fine-tune the controller.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires careful observation and iterative adjustments.  Start with a simple Ziegler-Nichols method or similar tuning approach.
- **Simulation Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the simulation will directly affect the controller's performance.  Simplifying the model for a daily scope may lead to less realistic behavior but is sufficient for learning purposes.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Controller Design:**  This project reinforces understanding of PID controllers and their application in control systems.
- **Control System Tuning:**  Hands-on experience in tuning PID gains and observing the effects on system stability and response.
