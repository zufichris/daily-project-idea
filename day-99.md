# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple AI agent that learns to play a classic, rule-based mini-game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four) using reinforcement learning. The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in understanding how reinforcement learning can be applied to game playing and how to structure an RL agent efficiently.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `gym`, `stable-baselines3` (or a similar RL library)
* **Optional:**  A game visualization library like `Pygame` for enhanced user experience.


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** Implement a basic environment for the chosen mini-game.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Train an agent using a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization).
- **Training and Evaluation:**  Train the agent on a substantial number of games and evaluate its performance against a random opponent.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track the win rate and average game length of the AI agent.
- **Save/Load Model:** Implement functionality to save and load the trained agent's model.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a self-play training regime where the agent plays against itself to improve learning.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Visualize the training process (e.g., plotting win rate over time).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the game environment using Python and optionally `Pygame` for visualization. Define the state space, action space, reward function, and game rules.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO from `stable-baselines3`) and integrate it with the environment.  Initialize the agent with appropriate hyperparameters.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that iteratively trains the agent by letting it play multiple games against a random opponent or itself (if implementing self-play).
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a random opponent, measuring win rate and average game length.
5. **Save and Visualization (Optional):** Save the trained model for later use. If using `Pygame`, visualize the agent playing a game against the opponent.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require experimentation. Start with default values and adjust based on initial results.
- **Computational Resources:** Training a sophisticated RL agent can be computationally intensive.  Focus on a simpler algorithm and/or reduce the training iterations for a daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:**  Gain practical experience with core RL concepts such as state, action, reward, policy, and training loops.
- **Agent Design and Implementation:** Learn to design and implement an RL agent, integrating it with a custom game environment.  This includes understanding the interplay between the agent and its environment.
