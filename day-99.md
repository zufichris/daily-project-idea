# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, robust calibration procedure for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately determine the robot's end-effector pose (position and orientation) in 3D space relative to a known reference point, without relying on pre-programmed calibration procedures. This is crucial for improving accuracy and flexibility in various robotic applications.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a suitable robotics library (e.g., ROS, PyBullet â€“ depending on the actual robot being used, a simulator might suffice for prototyping).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (physical or simulated), a camera (webcam or similar), a calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard).


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture images from the camera and detect the calibration target using OpenCV.
- **Pose Estimation:** Calculate the 3D pose of the calibration target relative to the camera.
- **Robot Forward Kinematics:**  Use the robot's kinematic model to predict the end-effector pose based on joint angles.
- **Calibration Optimization:** Develop an algorithm to minimize the error between the observed target pose (from vision) and the predicted end-effector pose.
- **Pose Visualization:** Display the calculated poses (camera, target, and end-effector) in a 3D visualization.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a real-time calibration loop for continuous adjustment and error correction.
- **Optional Feature:**  Incorporate different calibration target types beyond checkerboards for greater flexibility.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Image Acquisition:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. Capture a series of images of the calibration target at different robot poses.
2. **Target Detection and Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV's functions to detect the calibration target in each image and estimate its 3D pose using techniques like Perspective-n-Point (PnP).
3. **Forward Kinematics:** Implement the robot's forward kinematics to compute the end-effector pose for each captured image based on the robot's joint angles.
4. **Calibration Optimization:** Implement a least-squares or similar optimization algorithm to minimize the difference between the visually estimated target pose and the computed end-effector pose.  This step will refine the robot's kinematic parameters.
5. **Visualization and Validation:** Visualize the results in a 3D environment to verify the accuracy of the calibration.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Pose Estimation:**  Camera calibration and lighting conditions can affect the accuracy of pose estimation.  Careful camera calibration and lighting control are crucial.
- **Robot Kinematic Model Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the calibration depends heavily on the accuracy of the robot's kinematic model. Any inaccuracies in the model will propagate to the calibration results.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of computer vision techniques for pose estimation (PnP).
- Practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotics for calibration and control.
