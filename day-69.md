# Smart Home Device Integration with Custom Voice Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for integrating a smart home device (e.g., a smart light bulb) with a custom voice recognition system, allowing users to control the device using personalized voice commands.  This showcases practical application of speech recognition and smart home automation, providing a tangible outcome within a short timeframe. The significance lies in demonstrating the ability to bypass vendor-specific voice assistants and create a customized, more private solution.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Speech Recognition Library:** SpeechRecognition (with potentially a cloud-based alternative like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for higher accuracy)
* **Smart Home Protocol:**  A library supporting a chosen protocol (e.g.,  Home Assistant API for broad compatibility, or a specific device's API for direct control).
* **Hardware:** A smart light bulb (or similar controllable device) and a microphone (built-in or external).
* **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Command Recognition:** The system should accurately recognize a small set of pre-defined voice commands (e.g., "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the lamp," "Dim the lamp").
- **Device Control:**  The system should correctly execute the corresponding action on the chosen smart home device based on the recognized command.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling should be implemented to manage situations like unrecognized commands or network issues.
- **Simple User Interface:** A basic command-line interface (CLI) to display status and allow for quick testing and debugging.
- **Configuration:**  Ability to easily modify the recognized voice commands and device settings through a configuration file.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Contextual Awareness:** The system could consider the current time or location to adapt its responses.
- **Multiple Device Support:** Extending the system to control multiple devices simultaneously.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary Python libraries (SpeechRecognition and the chosen smart home protocol library). Configure the smart device for API access (obtain API keys/tokens if needed).
2. **Voice Recognition Module:** Implement the core voice recognition functionality using the chosen library.  Train the system on the pre-defined voice commands or utilize a cloud-based solution for better accuracy.
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Integrate the chosen smart home protocol library.  Write functions to translate recognized commands into API calls for controlling the smart device.
4. **CLI Development:** Create a simple CLI to display the system's status, handle user input (optional, for development convenience), and output logs.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with various voice inputs and refine the voice recognition and control logic to improve accuracy and stability.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with speech recognition can be challenging, especially with background noise or varying accents. Consider using a cloud-based service to address this.
- **Smart Home Device API Limitations:**  The chosen smart home device's API may have limitations on functionality or responsiveness.   This needs to be considered when designing the system's features.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Speech Recognition:** Gain hands-on experience using speech recognition libraries and integrating them into a real-world application.
- **Smart Home Automation Principles:** Learn about common protocols and API interactions for smart home devices and how to programmatically control them.
