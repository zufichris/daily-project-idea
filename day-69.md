# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Simulation

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simplified simulation of a self-balancing robot arm using Python and a physics engine.  The goal is to implement a basic control system that keeps the arm upright despite external disturbances. This project emphasizes rapid prototyping and showcases control system principles within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Physics Engine:** Pymunk (or a similar 2D physics engine)
* **Graphics Library:** Pygame (for visualization)
* **IDE:** Any suitable Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Arm Physics:** Simulate a single-jointed arm with mass and inertia using Pymunk.
- **Gravity & Balancing:** Implement gravity and a control algorithm (e.g., a simple PID controller) to keep the arm upright.
- **External Disturbances:**  Simulate small, random forces acting on the arm to test the robustness of the control system.
- **Visual Representation:**  Display the arm's movement and angle in a Pygame window.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the arm's angle and control signals over time for analysis.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., LQR) for improved stability.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add a second joint to the arm, increasing the complexity of the control problem.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pymunk, Pygame) and set up a basic project structure.
2. **Arm Modeling:** Define the arm's physical properties (mass, length, inertia) within Pymunk and create the arm's visual representation using Pygame.
3. **Control System Implementation:** Implement a simple PID controller or another suitable control algorithm to counteract gravity and external disturbances.
4. **Disturbance Simulation:** Introduce small, random forces to the arm model to test the controller's performance.
5. **Visualization & Testing:** Run the simulation, visualize the arm's movement, and observe its behavior under various conditions.  Adjust controller gains as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Controller Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gain values can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Starting with simple proportional control and gradually adding integral and derivative terms can simplify this process.
- **Computational Performance:**  While Pymunk is relatively efficient, handling complex simulations or high frame rates might lead to performance issues.  Simplifying the simulation or optimizing code may be necessary for smooth performance.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Control System Design:**  Reinforce understanding of basic control system concepts like PID controllers and their application to robotics.
- **Physics Engine Integration:** Gain experience integrating a physics engine with a visualization library to simulate real-world physical systems.
