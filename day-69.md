# Self-Healing Robotic Arm Trajectory Optimization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified simulation and control system for a robotic arm that can autonomously adjust its trajectory to avoid unexpected obstacles.  The focus is on a fast, efficient algorithm for trajectory replanning, suitable for prototyping within a short timeframe.  This is significant because robust obstacle avoidance is crucial for safe and efficient robotic operation in dynamic environments.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for optimization), Matplotlib (for visualization), Pygame (for basic simulation environment - optional, can be replaced with simpler visualization)
- **Robotics Simulation (Optional):**  A simple 2D robotic arm simulation can be created using Pygame or a similar library.  Alternatively, a pre-built simulator can be used if time is severely limited.


## Features & Requirements

- **Kinematic Model:** Implement a basic 2D robotic arm kinematic model (forward and inverse kinematics).
- **Obstacle Detection:** Simulate obstacle detection using a simple distance sensor model.
- **Trajectory Planning:**  Generate an initial trajectory using a simple algorithm (e.g., linear interpolation).
- **Trajectory Replanning:** Implement a rapid replanning algorithm (e.g., using a simplified potential field method or A*) when an obstacle is detected.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the robotic arm, obstacles, and trajectory in a 2D simulation.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporate a more sophisticated obstacle avoidance algorithm (e.g., RRT*),  Implement a more realistic robotic arm model with joint limits and dynamics.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Kinematic Modeling:** Define the robotic arm's geometry and implement forward and inverse kinematic functions.
2. **Obstacle Representation:**  Create a simple representation of obstacles within the simulation environment.
3. **Initial Trajectory Generation:**  Generate a straight-line trajectory from the start to the goal point.
4. **Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm:** Implement a basic obstacle avoidance algorithm (e.g., potential fields) that adjusts the trajectory when an obstacle is detected.
5. **Simulation & Visualization:** Simulate the robot arm's movement and visualize the trajectory, obstacles, and any replanning.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Efficiency:**  Choosing an efficient algorithm for trajectory replanning is crucial to achieving real-time performance within the time constraint.  A simple algorithm is prioritized for this daily challenge.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** Balancing simulation complexity with the time constraint.  A simplified simulation is appropriate for this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of kinematic modeling and control concepts:** This project solidifies understanding of forward and inverse kinematics, crucial for robotic manipulation.
- **Practical experience with trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms:**  This provides hands-on experience with common robotic control techniques.
