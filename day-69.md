# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control using Inverse Kinematics

## Overview
This project aims to create a rudimentary self-balancing robotic arm controlled using inverse kinematics.  The goal is to demonstrate the principles of IK in a tangible, miniaturized robotic system.  The focus is on achieving stable control, not sophisticated motion planning.  This is a challenging yet achievable daily project for experienced engineers.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for inverse kinematics calculations), Pygame (for visualization/control, optional), a robotics simulation library like PyBullet or V-REP (optional, but recommended for rapid prototyping).
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A small, lightweight robotic arm (e.g., a hobbyist kit), microcontroller (e.g., Arduino), sensors (e.g., IMU for balancing).  If hardware is unavailable, a simulation will suffice for the daily challenge.

## Features & Requirements
- **Inverse Kinematics Implementation:**  Calculate joint angles required to reach a target end-effector position using a suitable IK algorithm (e.g., Jacobian transpose).
- **Basic Arm Control:**  Allow the user to specify a target position (e.g., via keyboard input or mouse clicks in a simulation), and the arm should move to that position while maintaining balance.
- **Self-Balancing Mechanism:** Implement a simple PID controller to maintain the arm's upright position, counteracting disturbances.
- **Error Handling:**  Include checks for unreachable positions or singularity conditions in the IK solution.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Display the arm's movement and target position graphically.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and choose a simulation environment or connect hardware.
2. **Implement Inverse Kinematics:** Use SciPy or a custom function to solve the IK problem for the chosen robot arm's kinematics.
3. **Develop PID Controller:** Create a PID controller to regulate the arm's angle based on sensor data (simulated or real).
4. **Integrate Control and IK:** Combine the IK solver and PID controller to achieve controlled movement while maintaining balance.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various target positions, adjusting PID gains and IK parameters for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Real-time constraints:** Achieving smooth and responsive control in a real-world scenario requires efficient algorithms and potentially optimized code.  Simulation helps mitigate this.
- **Accuracy of IK solution:** The accuracy of the IK solution is crucial for stable control; using more advanced IK techniques may be necessary for higher accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcing understanding of inverse kinematics and its application in robotics.
- Practical experience in implementing and tuning PID controllers for real-time control systems.
