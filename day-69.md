# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple AI agent that learns to play a miniature version of a classic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, simplified Connect Four) using reinforcement learning. The focus is on rapid prototyping and observing the learning process within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental RL concept in a tangible and easily understandable way.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- A game environment (can be custom-coded or use a simple existing library)

## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:** A functional, playable mini-game with a clear win/loss/draw condition.
- **AI Agent:**  An agent that uses a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to learn optimal game strategies.
- **Training Loop:** A process to train the AI agent through repeated game play, updating its policy based on rewards.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  A method to evaluate the agent's performance (win rate, average game length, etc.).
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Basic visualization of the agent's learning curve or game board state.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN if time permits, requires more experience).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporate exploration-exploitation techniques (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to improve learning efficiency.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the core game logic.  Keep it extremely simple (3x3 board for Tic-Tac-Toe, for example).
2. **Agent Implementation:** Create the AI agent with a chosen reinforcement learning algorithm.  Start with Q-learning for simplicity.
3. **Training Loop Development:** Implement the training loop, including reward definition and policy updates.
4. **Evaluation and Testing:**  Run the training loop, evaluate the agent's performance, and analyze the learning curve.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Add basic visualizations to monitor progress (if time allows).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for effective learning.  A poorly designed reward may lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) can significantly impact performance and requires experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., Q-learning, state-action space, reward functions).
- Develops practical skills in implementing and evaluating a simple RL agent.
