# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately determine the robot's end-effector pose (position and orientation) relative to a known target in the workspace. This is crucial for precise manipulation tasks and demonstrates a fundamental aspect of robotics control.  The calibration will be achieved using a camera to observe the robot's end-effector at known locations.


## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a suitable robotics library (e.g., ROS, pybullet for simulation, or a specific robotic arm SDK).
* **Hardware:**  A robotic arm (physical or simulated), a camera (webcam or other suitable camera), a calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard pattern).


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition & Processing:** Capture images from the camera and process them to detect the calibration target.
- **Target Localization:** Accurately determine the target's position and orientation in the camera's coordinate system.
- **Robot Pose Estimation:**  Calculate the robot's end-effector pose based on the target's location and the robot's known joint angles.
- **Calibration Matrix Generation:**  Determine the transformation matrix mapping the camera's coordinate system to the robot's base coordinate system.
- **Verification:** Perform a simple verification step by commanding the robot to a new location and verifying the accuracy of the estimated pose.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement an iterative calibration procedure to refine the accuracy of the transformation matrix.
- **Optional Feature:**  Develop a user interface to visualize the calibration process and results.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and connect the camera and robotic arm (or load the simulation environment).
2. **Target Detection:** Implement a function using OpenCV to detect the calibration target in images acquired from the camera.
3. **Pose Estimation:**  Develop a function to estimate the robot's end-effector pose based on the camera's observations and the robot's joint angles. Use a known transformation between the end-effector and the target.
4. **Calibration Matrix Computation:**  Calculate the transformation matrix using a suitable algorithm (e.g., least-squares method) based on multiple observations.
5. **Verification & Refinement (Optional):**  Test the calibration by commanding the robot to different locations and comparing the estimated pose with the actual pose.  Iteratively refine the calibration matrix if necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of target detection:**  Dealing with noise and variations in lighting conditions can affect the accuracy of target localization.  Robust image processing techniques are crucial.
- **Camera calibration:**  The intrinsic parameters of the camera (focal length, distortion coefficients) will need to be known or estimated.  Pre-calibrating the camera separately might be necessary for higher accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision:** Practical experience in image processing, feature detection, and pose estimation.
- **Robotics:** Understanding and implementing robotic arm calibration procedures, including coordinate transformations and error handling.
