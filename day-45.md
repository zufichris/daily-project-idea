# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimal 2D game using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and showcasing the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning within a constrained timeframe.  The game will be sufficiently simple to allow for significant progress in a day or two, highlighting the power of RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar, e.g., RLlib)
* **Game Engine (Optional):** Pygame (for visualization; can be omitted for core functionality)
* **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A simple 2D grid-based game with a clear objective (e.g., reaching a goal, collecting items).
- **Agent Implementation:**  An AI agent that interacts with the environment using actions (e.g., move up, down, left, right).
- **Reward System:**  A defined reward structure that guides the agent's learning (e.g., positive reward for reaching the goal, negative reward for taking actions that hinder progress).
- **Training Loop:**  Implementation of a training loop that uses reinforcement learning to update the agent's policy.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics to assess the agent's learning progress (e.g., average reward per episode).

- **Advanced Feature:**  Incorporating a simple form of exploration-exploitation strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
- **Advanced Feature:** Visualization of the agent's learning process using Pygame or similar.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Game and Reward:** Design a simple 2D game environment and define its rules, actions, and a suitable reward structure.  This could be as simple as a grid with obstacles and a goal.
2. **Agent and Environment Setup:** Implement the game environment and the AI agent using Python. Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C) from Stable Baselines3.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively runs episodes of the game, allowing the agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy using the chosen RL algorithm.
4. **Evaluation and Iteration:** Evaluate the agent's performance using relevant metrics.  Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) or the reward function if needed to improve performance.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If using Pygame, implement visualization to monitor the agent's progress and behavior during training.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require experimentation. Start with default values and adjust incrementally.
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent towards the desired behavior can be challenging.  Careful consideration of the reward structure is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project provides hands-on experience with core RL concepts such as agents, environments, rewards, policies, and training loops.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Participants will learn to use and integrate a reinforcement learning library effectively, accelerating development and focusing on algorithm design and implementation.
