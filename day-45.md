# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI-Assisted Suggestions

## Overview

This project aims to develop a lightweight tool that automatically enforces a chosen coding style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) on a codebase, going beyond simple linting by incorporating AI-powered suggestions for style improvements.  The focus will be on a single language (Python) for the daily challenge. The significance lies in accelerating code review and improving overall code quality through automation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pycodestyle`, `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees), a lightweight Machine Learning library like `scikit-learn` (for a simplified approach; a pre-trained model could be used).
- **Tools:**  A code editor with a terminal or command-line interface.


## Features & Requirements

- **Automated Linting:**  Integrate `pycodestyle` to detect style violations.
- **AI-Assisted Suggestions (Simplified):**  For identified violations, offer a simplified suggestion based on common patterns (e.g., suggest adding a space after a comma). A more sophisticated version could involve classifying violation types and suggesting fixes based on pre-trained data.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Display violations and suggestions clearly in the terminal or editor.
- **Configurable Style Guide:** Allow users to specify the preferred style guide (e.g., through a configuration file).
- **Report Generation (Optional):** Generate a summary report of all violations and suggestions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:**  Install necessary libraries (`pycodestyle`, `scikit-learn` or a suitable pre-trained model).
2. **Linting Integration:** Integrate `pycodestyle` to parse code and identify violations.
3. **Suggestion Engine (Simplified):** Implement a basic rule-based system for suggesting fixes based on common violations. For example, if a line is longer than 79 characters, suggest breaking it up.  A pre-trained model can replace this step for a more advanced approach.
4. **Output & Feedback:** Display violations and suggestions in a user-friendly format in the terminal.
5. **Configuration:** Allow users to specify the style guide through a simple configuration file (e.g., JSON).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **AI Model Complexity:**  Implementing a robust AI-powered suggestion system within a day requires using a pre-trained model or simplifying the AI component significantly.  Focus on a small subset of common style violations for a daily challenge.
- **Handling Complex Code:**  The tool might struggle with highly complex code structures or edge cases.  Prioritize handling common scenarios.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of code style guides and best practices:**  Working with `pycodestyle` and implementing style enforcement will deepen the understanding of coding style conventions.
- **Practical experience with basic AI integration:** Even a simplified AI-powered suggestion system provides hands-on experience integrating machine learning into a software tool.
