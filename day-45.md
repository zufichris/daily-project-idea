# Real-time Object Recognition and Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, real-time object recognition and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will identify pre-defined objects within the camera's field of view and track their movement, providing coordinates and potentially other relevant data. This is a valuable prototype for applications like security monitoring, automated inventory management, or robotics navigation.  The focus is on achieving a functional prototype within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Raspberry Pi:**  Any model with sufficient processing power (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4).
- **Camera:** A Raspberry Pi compatible camera module.
- **Python:** Programming language.
- **OpenCV:**  Computer vision library for image processing and object detection.
- **TensorFlow Lite (optional):**  For faster inference if pre-trained models are used.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  Detect pre-defined objects (e.g., a red ball, a specific person's face) within the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the identified objects' movement, providing real-time coordinates (x, y).
- **Visualization:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes around detected objects and their coordinates overlaid.
- **Data Logging (optional):** Record object positions over time for later analysis.
- **Alert System (optional):** Trigger an alert (e.g., sound, notification) when a specific object enters or leaves a defined area.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite if using), configure the camera, and test the basic camera feed.
2. **Object Detection Model:** Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or a simpler custom-trained model focusing on only a few specific objects) or implement a simpler color-based object detection.
3. **Tracking Implementation:** Integrate a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, simple centroid tracking) to follow detected objects frame-by-frame.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and coordinates onto the video stream using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **(Optional)  Alert System and Data Logging:** Implement alert triggers based on object position and/or record object trajectories to a file.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:**  The Raspberry Pi's limited processing power might be a constraint.  Using a lightweight object detection model and optimizing the code is crucial.
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the object detection model directly impacts the tracking performance. Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model or training a simple custom model with sufficient data is key.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:** Gain practical experience with OpenCV for video stream processing, object detection, and visualization.
- **Object tracking algorithms:** Understand and implement basic object tracking algorithms and their limitations.  This reinforces concepts of state estimation and filtering.
