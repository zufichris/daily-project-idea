# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home appliance control system using a combination of voice commands and hand gestures. The system will focus on controlling a single appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating multiple input modalities for intuitive control. This is significant because it explores a more natural and accessible interface than traditional button-based or app-based control.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  PyAudio (audio input), OpenCV (computer vision for gesture recognition), a suitable library for your chosen voice recognition engine (e.g., SpeechRecognition),  RPi.GPIO (if using a Raspberry Pi for physical appliance control).
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi (for direct appliance control),  Webcam.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Command Control:**  The system should respond to at least three distinct voice commands (e.g., "Turn on," "Turn off," "Dim").
- **Gesture Control:** The system should recognize at least two distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm for "on," closed fist for "off").
- **Appliance Interaction:** The system should control the state of a target smart appliance (e.g., turning a lamp on/off or adjusting brightness).
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide visual or auditory feedback upon successful command execution.
- **Error Handling:** The system should handle voice recognition errors and invalid gestures gracefully.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple user interface (e.g., a basic GUI) to visualize the current appliance state and allow for manual override.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Extend gesture recognition to include more complex gestures (e.g., swiping for brightness adjustment).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries, configure your voice recognition engine, and test your webcam.
2. **Voice Recognition Integration:** Implement voice command recognition using the chosen library and link it to actions (e.g., function calls to control the appliance).
3. **Gesture Recognition Implementation:**  Use OpenCV to detect and classify pre-defined hand gestures, associating each with corresponding actions.
4. **Appliance Control Integration:**  Implement the code to interact with your chosen smart appliance (this may involve direct hardware control using RPi.GPIO or communication with a smart home API).
5. **Feedback & Error Handling:**  Add feedback mechanisms (visual or auditory) and robust error handling for failed voice or gesture recognition.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture/Voice Recognition:**  Real-world conditions (lighting, background noise) can significantly impact accuracy. Consider using techniques like image pre-processing (for gestures) and noise reduction (for voice).
- **Appliance Compatibility:**  Ensure compatibility between your control system and the chosen smart appliance.  This may require consulting appliance documentation and APIs.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project will reinforce experience with real-time processing of audio and visual data.
- The project will provide practical experience in integrating multiple input modalities (voice and vision) for seamless user interaction.
