# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robotics

## Overview
This project aims to develop a compact, efficient AI model for generating descriptive captions for images captured by a robot's onboard camera.  This capability is crucial for robots operating in unstructured environments, allowing for better situational awareness and autonomous decision-making.  The daily challenge focuses on building a functional prototype capable of generating basic captions.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- A pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or Hugging Face)
- A simple image dataset (e.g., COCO subset or a custom dataset)


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Preprocessing:**  Resize and normalize input images for compatibility with the chosen model.
- **Caption Generation:**  Utilize a pre-trained model to generate a textual description of the image.
- **Output Display:** Display the generated caption alongside the original image.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle potential errors during image loading or caption generation.
- **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable pre-trained model based on computational resources and desired caption quality.

- **Optional Features:**  Implement a mechanism for user feedback to improve model accuracy over time.
- **Advanced Feature:** Integrate with a robotic control system to trigger actions based on generated captions (e.g., "object detected: pick up").

## Implementation Steps
1. **Dataset and Model Selection:** Choose a pre-trained image captioning model and a small, representative image dataset.
2. **Preprocessing & Inference:**  Write Python code to preprocess images and use the selected model to generate captions.
3. **Output Integration:** Create a user interface (GUI or command-line) to display the image and the generated caption.
4. **Error Handling:** Add basic error handling for common issues like missing files or invalid image formats.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test with various images and refine the code to handle edge cases.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Resources:**  Pre-trained image captioning models can be computationally intensive.  Consider using a model optimized for resource-constrained environments.
- **Dataset Bias:**  The quality of generated captions is heavily dependent on the dataset used to train the pre-trained model.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of skills in utilizing pre-trained AI models.
- Practical experience in integrating AI with image processing and user interface development.
