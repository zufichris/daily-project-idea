# Self-Balancing Robot with PID Control (Simplified)

## Overview
This project aims to create a simplified self-balancing robot using a minimal set of components and focusing on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for balance.  The goal is not a fully robust, production-ready robot, but a functional prototype demonstrating core control system principles within a short timeframe.  This project emphasizes practical application of PID control, a crucial concept in robotics and automation.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries listed below)
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (with an IMU like MPU6050)
- **Actuators:** Two DC motors with motor drivers (L298N is suitable)
- **Sensors:** MPU6050 6-axis IMU (for angle and angular velocity)
- **Libraries:**  `PySerial` (for Arduino communication),  `mpu6050` (for IMU data acquisition), potentially a custom PID control library or a simplified implementation.


## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain an upright position when perturbed.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A functional PID controller should be implemented to regulate the robot's angle.
- **Motor Control:**  The robot's motors should respond accurately to the PID controller's output.
- **Data Visualization (Optional):**  Real-time visualization of angle, angular velocity, and motor output.
- **Calibration Routine (Optional):**  A simple calibration routine to adjust sensor offsets.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU, motors, and motor drivers to the Arduino.  Ensure power supply is adequate.
2. **Sensor Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Write Arduino code to read IMU data and send it to the computer via serial communication. Verify data accuracy.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Write Python code implementing a simplified PID controller based on the received IMU data.  Tune the PID gains (P, I, D) experimentally.
4. **Motor Control Implementation:** Write Python code to translate PID output into appropriate motor commands sent to the Arduino.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the robot's balancing capabilities and iterate on PID gains for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustment.  Starting with low gains and gradually increasing them is recommended.
- **Sensor Noise:** The IMU may produce noisy data; implementing a simple filter (e.g., moving average) might improve stability.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical Application of PID Control:** This project provides hands-on experience with designing and implementing a PID controller in a real-world system.
- **Embedded Systems and Sensor Integration:**  It reinforces skills in interfacing a microcontroller with sensors and actuators.
