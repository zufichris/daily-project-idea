# Robotic Arm Calibration with OpenCV

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a quick calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately map the robot's joint angles to its end-effector's position in 3D space using a simple visual marker and OpenCV. This is crucial for precise robotic manipulation tasks and can significantly improve accuracy in a short development time.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- A robotic arm (physical or simulated, e.g., using PyBullet)
- A camera (physical or simulated)
- A visual marker (e.g., a checkerboard pattern)


## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera to determine intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients).
- **Marker Detection:** Detect the visual marker in each camera frame using OpenCV's `aruco` module or similar.
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the marker relative to the camera.
- **Joint Angle Measurement:**  Obtain joint angle readings from the robotic arm's sensors.
- **Calibration Data Generation:** Generate a dataset mapping joint angles to marker poses.

- **Optional 1:** Implement a simple inverse kinematics solution to predict joint angles from a desired end-effector pose.
- **Optional 2:**  Visualize the calibration data and the estimated pose in a 3D environment (e.g., using Matplotlib or a 3D visualization library).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera and Marker Setup:** Set up the camera and place the marker in the robot's workspace. Calibrate the camera using OpenCV's built-in functions.
2. **Marker Detection and Pose Estimation:**  Implement marker detection and pose estimation using OpenCV. Capture images, detect the marker, and obtain its pose.
3. **Data Acquisition:**  Move the robotic arm to several different poses, recording both the joint angles and the corresponding marker poses for each pose.
4. **Calibration Model:** Use a simple linear regression or other suitable method (depending on the robot's kinematics) to create a mapping between joint angles and marker poses.
5. **Validation (Optional):** Test the calibration model by commanding the robot to specific poses and comparing the actual end-effector position with the predicted position based on the calibration data.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy depends on the quality of the camera calibration, marker detection, and the precision of the robotic arm's sensors. Noise in the data can significantly impact accuracy.
- **Computational Cost:**  Processing images and performing pose estimation can be computationally intensive, potentially requiring optimization techniques.

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with camera calibration and pose estimation using OpenCV.
- Understanding of robotic arm kinematics and calibration techniques.
- Practical application of linear regression or other suitable modeling techniques for data fitting.
