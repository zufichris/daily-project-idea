# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with Webcam Feed

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed. The system will detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and classify it, demonstrating fundamental computer vision concepts within a limited timeframe. This is significant as it showcases practical application of object detection and tracking, fundamental skills for robotics and automation.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (or a similar lightweight ML library like scikit-learn for simpler classification), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a Jupyter Notebook or IDE for Python development.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Webcam Feed Acquisition:** Capture video frames from a connected webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within each frame using color filtering or a simpler machine learning model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across consecutive frames using algorithms like Kalman filtering or simple centroid tracking.
- **Object Classification (Optional):** Classify the detected object using a pre-trained model or a simple classifier trained on a small dataset.
- **Visual Output:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes around the detected object and potentially classification labels.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy).  Connect the webcam and test the feed using OpenCV.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement color filtering (HSV thresholding) or load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a small, mobile-friendly model from TensorFlow Lite) to detect the object.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a centroid tracker to maintain the object's position across frames.  Simple difference in consecutive centroid coordinates will work for a short-term project.
4. **Visualisation:** Overlay bounding boxes and potentially classification labels onto the video feed and display it using OpenCV's window.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** Improve tracking robustness by incorporating Kalman filtering or explore more sophisticated object detection models if time permits.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive.  Simpler algorithms and potentially downscaling the video resolution might be necessary to maintain real-time performance.
- **Object Occlusion:**  Handling situations where the target object is temporarily occluded will require more advanced tracking algorithms which might not be feasible within the daily constraint. A simpler solution would be to reset tracking when object disappears.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of OpenCV:**  Gain hands-on experience with image processing, video handling, and display functionalities in OpenCV.
- **Fundamental computer vision concepts:** Reinforce understanding of object detection, tracking, and basic image analysis techniques.
