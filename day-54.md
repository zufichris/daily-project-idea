# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus is on creating a robust and efficient system capable of recognizing a small set of pre-defined gestures within a short timeframe. This could be a valuable component in assistive technology or enhancing user experience for smart home ecosystems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model optimization and deployment)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, (optional) Raspberry Pi for deployment.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm, thumbs up, fist) with high accuracy.
- **Real-time Processing:** Process webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Device Control Simulation:**  Simulate control of smart home devices (lights, fan) based on recognized gestures.  This could be as simple as printing the recognized gesture to the console.
- **User Calibration:**  Allow for initial calibration to account for individual hand size and position variations.
- **GUI (Optional):** A simple graphical user interface to display the recognized gesture and control simulated devices.

- **Advanced Features:**
    - Gesture Sequence Recognition (e.g., recognizing a sequence of gestures for more complex commands).
    - Background Subtraction to improve robustness against cluttered backgrounds.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture a dataset of images/videos of the target gestures using the webcam.  Preprocess the data (resizing, normalization).
2. **Model Training (Simplified):** Use a simple machine learning model (e.g., a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier or a small, pre-trained convolutional neural network) to classify the gestures based on the features extracted from hand images.  For a 1-2 day challenge, pre-trained models are strongly recommended.
3. **Real-time Gesture Detection:** Integrate the trained model with OpenCV and MediaPipe to process webcam feed in real-time, detecting and classifying hand gestures.
4. **Device Control Simulation:** Implement a basic system to simulate control actions based on the detected gestures (e.g., printing a message to the console or changing the color of a simulated light on the GUI).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Evaluate the system's accuracy and responsiveness, iteratively refining the model and parameters based on testing results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy & Robustness:**  Achieving high accuracy in real-time with a small dataset can be challenging.  Careful data collection and model selection are crucial.
- **Computational Cost:**  Processing webcam feed in real-time requires efficient algorithms and potentially optimized hardware.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical experience in computer vision.** This project will provide hands-on experience with using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand tracking.
- **Develop skills in model selection and evaluation.**  Choosing an appropriate model and evaluating its performance using relevant metrics will be crucial for success.
