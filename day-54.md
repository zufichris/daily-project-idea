# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary self-balancing robot arm using a microcontroller and a PID control algorithm. The robot arm will consist of a single servo motor controlling the arm's angle, aiming to maintain a specific target angle despite external disturbances.  This project is significant as it demonstrates a fundamental control system principle commonly used in robotics and automation.  A successful prototype within a day showcases competency in embedded systems and control theory.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 for wireless options).
* **Servo Motor:** A standard hobby servo motor with sufficient torque.
* **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** An MPU6050 or similar for angle sensing.
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Libraries:** Servo library (for Arduino), MPU6050 library.

## Features & Requirements

- **Angle Sensing:** Accurately read the arm's angle using the IMU.
- **PID Control Implementation:** Implement a PID controller to maintain a user-defined target angle.
- **Target Angle Setting:** Allow setting of the desired arm angle (e.g., through serial communication).
- **Stabilization:** Maintain the target angle despite small disturbances (e.g., tapping the arm).
- **Basic Error Handling:** Provide basic error reporting for sensor readings or servo issues.

**Advanced Features:**
- **Automatic Calibration:** Implement automatic calibration of the IMU and servo.
- **Visual Feedback:**  Use a simple visual display (e.g., LED) to indicate the arm's state.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU, servo, and microcontroller, ensuring proper power supply and grounding.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the IMU to obtain accurate angle readings.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Write the PID control algorithm, tuning the gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) experimentally for optimal performance.
4. **Target Angle Control:**  Implement the logic for setting and maintaining the target angle.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system's stability and adjust PID gains for improved performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments. Start with low gains and gradually increase them while monitoring the system's response.
- **IMU Noise:** IMU readings are often noisy; implementing a moving average filter or other noise reduction techniques is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:**  Gain practical experience with designing and implementing PID controllers, a fundamental control algorithm in robotics.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:** Improve skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time control.
