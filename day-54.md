# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a miniature game using reinforcement learning (RL).  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts.  The chosen game will be straightforward enough to allow for significant progress within a day or two.  This showcases a practical application of RL in a manageable timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), Gym (for environment creation, optional)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook or IDE of choice (VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A simple game environment (e.g., a grid-based navigation game with rewards and penalties).
    -  An RL agent (e.g., using Q-learning or a simpler algorithm) that learns through trial and error.
    -  Training loop to iterate and improve agent performance.
    -  Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., plots of reward over time).
    -  Basic agent decision-making based on learned Q-values or policy.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Implementing a more complex RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    -  Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for better interaction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Game Environment:** Create a simple game environment (e.g., a 5x5 grid where the agent needs to navigate to a target while avoiding obstacles).  You can use a library like Gym or manually code the environment.
2. **Choose & Implement the RL Algorithm:** Select a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning). Implement the algorithm in Python using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the training loop for a predetermined number of episodes or until a satisfactory performance level is achieved.  Monitor the agent's progress through reward values.
4. **Evaluate and Visualize:** Evaluate the agent's performance after training. Visualize learning curves (reward over time) to assess progress.
5. **Refine and Extend (Optional):**  If time permits, implement the optional advanced features, such as a more complex algorithm or a GUI.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) for the chosen RL algorithm can require experimentation. Start with reasonable defaults and adjust as needed based on the learning curves.
- **Environment Design:**  The complexity of the game environment needs to be carefully balanced.  A too-simple environment might not be challenging enough; a too-complex one might be intractable within the time constraint.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project reinforces the core concepts of reinforcement learning, including rewards, states, actions, and the learning process.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Gain hands-on experience utilizing TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for building and training RL agents.
