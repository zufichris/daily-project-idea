# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple but functional system for real-time object detection and tracking using a web camera, leveraging the power of WebRTC for efficient streaming and client-side processing.  The significance lies in exploring the integration of computer vision with real-time communication technologies, potentially useful for applications like remote inspection, augmented reality overlays, or interactive security systems.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js for potential backend components)
- **Framework/Library:** TensorFlow.js (for object detection), WebRTC (for video streaming), potentially OpenCV.js for more advanced image processing.
- **Tools:** A web browser (Chrome recommended), a web camera, and a text editor/IDE.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  Capture and stream video from a web camera using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Implement a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet SSD) in TensorFlow.js to detect objects in the video stream.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected objects across frames using a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking).
- **Display Results:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels on the video stream to indicate detected and tracked objects.
- **Basic UI:** A minimal HTML interface to control the camera and display the results.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Object Classification Confidence Threshold:** Allow users to adjust the confidence level for object detection.
- **Multiple Object Tracking:** Implement a more robust multi-object tracking algorithm.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup WebRTC Streaming:**  Set up a basic WebRTC connection to stream video from the webcam to the browser.
2. **Load and Integrate TensorFlow.js Model:** Load a pre-trained object detection model using TensorFlow.js and integrate it with the video stream.
3. **Implement Object Detection and Tracking:** Process each frame of the video stream using the model and implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow objects across frames.
4. **Display Results:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels onto the video stream, displaying the detected and tracked objects.
5. **Build Basic UI:** Create a minimal HTML user interface for the application.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Performance Optimization:**  Real-time processing of video streams can be computationally intensive.  Careful model selection and optimization techniques (e.g., reducing frame rate, simplifying the tracking algorithm) may be needed to maintain a smooth frame rate.
- **Accuracy of Object Tracking:**  Simple tracking algorithms can struggle with occlusion or rapid movements.  More advanced techniques might be needed for improved accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of WebRTC implementation:**  Hands-on experience with building and implementing real-time video streaming using WebRTC.
- **Practical Application of TensorFlow.js:**  Applying a pre-trained model for object detection in a real-world application, understanding its limitations, and potential for improvement.
