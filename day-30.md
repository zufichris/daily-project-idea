# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI-Assisted Suggestion

## Overview
This project aims to build a prototype tool that automatically enforces a specific code style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) using a combination of static analysis and AI-powered suggestions for corrections.  This goes beyond simple linters by offering intelligent, context-aware recommendations to improve code readability and maintainability.  The focus will be on a specific language and a limited subset of style rules for a daily challenge scope.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: `flake8`, `pycodestyle`, `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees), potentially a small pre-trained language model (e.g., a fine-tuned version of a small BERT model for code).
- Tools:  VS Code or similar IDE for development.


## Features & Requirements
- **Automated Linting:**  Integrate `flake8` or `pycodestyle` to identify style violations.
- **AI-Assisted Suggestion (Core):**  For a subset of identified violations (e.g., line length, whitespace), generate contextual suggestions for correction using a simple heuristic or small pre-trained model (optional).
- **Interactive Output:** Present the identified violations and AI suggestions to the user in a clear and understandable format (e.g., a formatted report or integrated into an IDE).
- **Configuration:** Allow users to specify the level of strictness and customize the style guide used.
- **Reporting:**  Generate a report summarizing the number of violations and the types of corrections suggested.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Integrate the tool with a version control system (e.g., Git) to automatically suggest and apply corrections in pull requests.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Expand the AI model to handle more complex style violations (e.g., naming conventions, code complexity).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Linting Integration:** Set up the development environment and integrate `flake8` or `pycodestyle` to analyze a sample Python codebase.
2. **Core Functionality (Static Analysis):** Focus on a subset of style violations (e.g., line length exceeding 79 characters).  Implement logic to identify and report these violations.
3. **Basic AI Suggestion (Heuristic):**  Develop a simple heuristic function to suggest corrections for the selected violations (e.g., automatically split long lines). (For a more advanced challenge, attempt integration with a lightweight pre-trained model).
4. **Output & Reporting:** Create functions to display the results in a user-friendly format (e.g., a console report or integration with an IDE plugin).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the tool on various code samples and refine the logic and reporting mechanisms.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **AI Model Integration (Optional):** Integrating a pre-trained language model might require significant preprocessing and might exceed the daily time constraint.  Focusing on a simpler heuristic approach is a viable alternative for the daily challenge scope.
- **Handling Ambiguity:** Some style violations can have multiple valid corrections.  The tool should ideally handle such ambiguity gracefully, perhaps by providing multiple suggestions or prioritizing them based on certain criteria.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of static code analysis:**  Understand how linters work and how to integrate them into a development workflow.
- **Introduction to AI-assisted code improvement:** Gain experience with incorporating basic AI techniques (heuristics or simple models) to enhance software development tools.
