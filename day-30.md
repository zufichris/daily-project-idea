# Mini-Game AI: Reinforcement Learning for Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on creating a functional, albeit basic, AI within a short timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts.  The significance lies in showcasing the power of RL in a easily understandable game environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `gym`, `stable-baselines3` (or similar RL library like `tensorflow-agents`)
- Tools:  A suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), Jupyter Notebook (optional).


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  Agent plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human opponent.
    -  Agent learns through reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler approach).
    -  The agent's performance improves over time through multiple games.
    -  Game state is visually represented (simple text-based interface sufficient).
    -  Basic win/loss/draw tracking.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network if time permits).
    -  Visualize the Q-values or policy learned by the agent (optional, might require extra time).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the Tic-Tac-Toe environment using `gym` or a custom implementation.  This involves defining the state space, action space, reward function, and game logic.
2. **Agent Selection & Training:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning). Implement the agent and train it against a random opponent or a simple rule-based agent.
3. **Game Integration:** Integrate the trained agent into a simple text-based game interface allowing human interaction.
4. **Testing & Evaluation:** Play several games against the AI to assess its performance.  Note improvements in strategy over training iterations.
5. **Optional Visualization (if time allows):** Visualize the Q-values or the learned policy of the agent using a heatmap or other suitable method.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully crafting the reward function is crucial for the agent's learning.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions) is essential for effective learning.  Experiment with different exploration strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with implementing and applying a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Environment Design:**  Understand the process of designing a suitable environment for reinforcement learning, including defining states, actions, and rewards.
