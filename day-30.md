# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project involves developing a simple AI agent that learns to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning techniques.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts within a limited timeframe. The game will be sufficiently simple to allow for significant progress in a day or two.  This project showcases a practical application of AI and highlights the power of reinforcement learning in a concise example.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A simple game environment (e.g., a grid-based game with a reward system).
    -  An AI agent that interacts with the environment.
    -  Implementation of a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
    -  Training the agent to achieve a specific goal within the game.
    -  Visualization of the agent's performance (e.g., plotting rewards over time).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    -  Adding different levels of difficulty to the game.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement a simple game environment using a library like Pygame or a custom implementation. Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Create the AI agent using a chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point).  Initialize the Q-table or neural network.
3. **Training Loop:**  Implement a training loop that iteratively interacts the agent with the environment, updates the Q-table/neural network based on received rewards, and monitors performance.
4. **Visualization:**  Visualize the agent's learning process by plotting its reward over training episodes.
5. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the agent's performance after training by running several test episodes and observing its success rate.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**  Finding the right balance between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions that have yielded high rewards in the past) is crucial for efficient learning. This can be addressed using techniques like epsilon-greedy exploration.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  The performance of the RL algorithm is sensitive to hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor).  Experimentation might be needed to find optimal values within the time constraint.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts such as state, action, reward, Q-learning, and exploration-exploitation trade-off.
- **Practical Application of Python & Deep Learning Libraries:**  The project provides hands-on experience with Python, and a deep learning framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras) in the context of a practical problem.
