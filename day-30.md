# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated or physical self-balancing robot.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing using a simplified model, focusing on rapid PID tuning and controller implementation. This project is significant because PID control is a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems, and this provides hands-on experience with its implementation and tuning.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID controller), Pygame (optional, for visualization)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino Uno/Nano, MPU6050 IMU, motor driver, small motors


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balancing:** The robot should maintain an upright position when disturbed from equilibrium.
- **PID Implementation:**  A functional PID controller should be implemented from scratch or using a suitable library.
- **Gain Tuning:**  The PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) should be adjustable and tunable to optimize performance.
- **Sensor Input (Optional):** If using a physical robot, integrate IMU data for angle and angular velocity.
- **Actuator Control (Optional):** If using a physical robot, control the motors to adjust the robot's orientation.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Setup:** Create a simplified inverted pendulum model (either simulated or physical). If simulated, use equations of motion to calculate the robot's dynamics; if physical, establish communication with the IMU and motor driver.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID algorithm using NumPy/SciPy.  This involves calculating the error, proportional, integral, and derivative terms, and summing them to determine the control output.
3. **Gain Tuning:** Start with initial gains, and iteratively adjust Kp, Ki, and Kd using trial and error or a more systematic approach (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method). Observe the robot's response and refine gains for optimal stability and response time.
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the controller's performance with various disturbances.  Adjust the gains as needed to minimize oscillations and ensure stability.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If using a simulation, visualize the robot's motion using Pygame or a similar library.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Gain Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires careful observation and iterative adjustment.  Oscillations or instability can arise from poorly tuned gains.
- **Sensor Noise (Physical Robot):**  IMU data can be noisy, which can affect the controller's performance.  Filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** This project reinforces understanding of PID control theory and its practical application.
- **System Tuning:**  Hands-on experience in tuning control parameters for optimal system performance and stability will be gained.
