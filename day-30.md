#  Miniature Robot Maze Solver with Dynamic Pathfinding

## Overview

This project aims to build a miniature robot capable of autonomously navigating a simple maze.  The focus is on implementing a dynamic pathfinding algorithm, allowing the robot to adapt to changes in the maze environment (e.g., added obstacles) during runtime. This challenge emphasizes rapid prototyping and efficient algorithm implementation within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Microcontroller:**  Arduino Nano (or similar)
* **Sensors:** Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
* **Actuators:** Two DC motors with motor drivers (L293D)
* **Libraries:**  `RPi.GPIO` (if using a Raspberry Pi for higher-level control), Arduino libraries for motor control and ultrasonic sensor reading.
* **Software:** A simple maze visualization tool (optional, for debugging)


## Features & Requirements

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot should autonomously navigate a predefined maze.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Using the ultrasonic sensor, the robot should detect and avoid obstacles within its path.
- **Dynamic Pathfinding:** Implement a simple pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*, but potentially simplified for the day's scope) to recalculate the path if new obstacles are introduced.
- **Motor Control:** Precise control of the robot's motors to move forward, backward, and turn.
- **Maze Representation:**  A simple internal representation of the maze (e.g., a grid or adjacency matrix) should be used or dynamically built by the robot's sensor readings.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Integration with a camera module for visual maze mapping.
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated pathfinding algorithm (e.g., D*).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the ultrasonic sensor, motors, and motor drivers to the Arduino. Test basic motor control and sensor readings.
2. **Sensor Integration:** Write code to read and interpret ultrasonic sensor data to detect obstacles.
3. **Basic Maze Navigation:** Implement a simple wall-following algorithm to guide the robot through the maze. This can be a starting point before implementing dynamic pathfinding.
4. **Dynamic Pathfinding (Simplified):** Implement a simplified version of A* or a similar algorithm to allow for dynamic path recalculation based on sensor feedback.  Focus on a small maze to reduce computational complexity.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the robot's navigation capabilities in different maze configurations and with added obstacles.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Efficiency:**  Implementing a sophisticated pathfinding algorithm within a limited time requires careful optimization and potentially simplification.
- **Sensor Noise:** Ultrasonic sensors can be prone to noise; appropriate filtering or averaging techniques might be necessary to obtain reliable data.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Reinforces skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and actuator control.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:**  Provides practical experience in implementing and optimizing pathfinding algorithms for robotics applications.
