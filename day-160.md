# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The system will detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's view, classifying it and displaying relevant information like bounding boxes and labels on the video feed. This is a practical application of computer vision, useful in various fields from robotics to surveillance.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional for pre-trained models)
- **Tools:** Webcam, IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video stream from a webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Detect the presence of a pre-defined object (e.g., color-based detection).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object.
- **Classification (Optional):** Classify the tracked object using a pre-trained model (if using TensorFlow/PyTorch).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Calculate the object's trajectory. Implement a more robust tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) to handle occlusions.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch if needed).  Set up the webcam connection.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement color-based object detection using OpenCV's thresholding and contour detection functions.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's tracking APIs (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`) to track the detected object across frames.
4. **Display:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels (if classifying) on the video feed.
5. **Refinement:** Test and refine the detection and tracking parameters to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Object Occlusion:** Handling situations where the object is temporarily hidden from view.  This could be partially addressed with a more advanced tracking algorithm (Kalman filter).
- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can affect color-based detection. Consider implementing adaptive thresholding techniques.


## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthen practical skills in computer vision using OpenCV.
- Gain experience with real-time video processing and object tracking algorithms.
