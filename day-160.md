# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimal, text-based game using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstration of basic RL principles, rather than creating a sophisticated game or AI. The game will be sufficiently simple to allow significant progress within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple text-based game environment (e.g., a grid-based maze navigation).
    - An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
    - Ability to visualize the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting rewards over time).
    - Ability to run multiple training episodes and observe performance improvement.
    - Basic reward system designed for the game (e.g., reaching the goal, avoiding obstacles).


- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more complex reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Implementing a different game environment (e.g., a simple card game).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game rules and state representation. Create a Python class or function to simulate the game environment. This could be a simple text-based maze or another easily implementable game.
2. **Agent Implementation:**  Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point). Implement the agent's logic for choosing actions based on the environment's state and its learned Q-values.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that repeatedly interacts with the environment, allowing the agent to learn from its experiences.  Record reward and other relevant metrics.
4. **Visualization:** Implement plotting to visually represent the agent's learning progress (e.g., reward over time).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** After training, test the agent's performance and make adjustments to the algorithm or environment as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to unexpected or suboptimal behavior.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using actions known to yield good rewards) is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning.  This may require tuning parameters of the chosen algorithm.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of basic RL concepts like state, action, reward, and the learning process itself.
- **Practical Application of RL:**  It provides hands-on experience in implementing and applying a simple RL algorithm to a concrete problem, demonstrating its core mechanics.
