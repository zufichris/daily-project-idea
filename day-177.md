# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  Instead of relying on larger, more obvious hand movements, the system will focus on subtle finger movements or hand positions to trigger specific actions, providing a more discreet and intuitive interaction method.  This is significant as it explores a novel input modality for smart home applications, potentially enhancing user experience and accessibility.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation), TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional, for machine learning model training if time permits).
* **Tools:**  Webcam, Jupyter Notebook or IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  Accurately capture and process webcam feed to detect pre-defined micro-gestures (e.g., subtle finger taps, hand positions near the camera).
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Classify captured gestures into distinct actions (e.g., tap for "lights on," specific hand positions for "increase/decrease volume").
- **Action Triggering:**  Execute pre-programmed commands based on the recognized gesture (e.g., sending commands to a simulated smart home environment or actual smart home devices via API).
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Provide visual feedback to the user (e.g., on-screen display confirming gesture recognition).
- **Calibration:** Allow for easy calibration of the system to account for variations in lighting and user positioning.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement a simple machine learning model to improve gesture recognition accuracy over time.
- **Advanced Feature:** Integrate with a real smart home ecosystem (e.g., Philips Hue, IFTTT).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture a dataset of micro-gestures using the webcam and preprocess the images (resizing, noise reduction).  Focus on 2-3 distinct gestures initially.
2. **Gesture Feature Extraction:**  Use MediaPipe or similar library to extract relevant features from the images (e.g., hand landmarks, finger angles).
3. **Gesture Classification:**  Implement a simple classifier (e.g., k-nearest neighbors or decision tree) to map features to gestures.
4. **Action Execution:**  Develop the logic to trigger specific actions based on the classification results (initially simulate actions).
5. **User Interface:** Create a basic user interface (e.g., using OpenCV's display functionality) to show the detected gestures and feedback.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to Noise:**  Micro-gestures are subtle, making them vulnerable to noise (lighting changes, hand tremors).  Careful feature selection and preprocessing are crucial.
- **Accuracy:**  Achieving high accuracy with limited training data may be challenging.  Prioritizing simple, easily distinguishable gestures helps.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience with image processing, feature extraction, and classification for a real-world application.
- **Develop skills in building a real-time interactive system:** This project emphasizes building a system that responds dynamically to user input, improving understanding of event handling and responsiveness in software.
