# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a rudimentary reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.  The focus will be on creating a functional prototype demonstrating the core concepts of RL in a short timeframe.  The game will be minimalistic to prioritize rapid development and clear demonstration of the AIâ€™s learning process.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- A reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Basic Game Mechanics:**  A simple game like "Catch" (catching falling objects) or a simplified Pong clone.
- **RL Agent Implementation:**  An AI opponent using a basic RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler approach).
- **Game Visualization:** Real-time display of the game state and the AI's performance.
- **Reward System:**  A clear reward system defining how the AI receives feedback (e.g., points for catching objects).
- **Basic Training Loop:** A loop allowing the AI to train and improve its performance over a fixed number of iterations.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implementation of a simple neural network as the function approximator within the RL algorithm.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Incorporating a basic persistent storage mechanism to save and load the trained AI model.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Design and implement the basic game using Pygame.  Focus on a very simple game with clear rules and a minimal visual interface.
2. **Environment Definition:**  Create a class representing the game environment for the RL agent.  This includes functions to perform actions, receive observations, and calculate rewards.
3. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement it using the chosen library.  Start with a simpler algorithm for time constraints.
4. **Training Loop:**  Develop a training loop that iteratively runs the game, allowing the RL agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy.
5. **Visualization & Evaluation:**  Display the game visually and add basic metrics to track the AI's performance over time (e.g., average reward per episode).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Game Complexity & RL Implementation:**  The game needs to be simple enough to allow rapid prototyping but complex enough to present a meaningful learning challenge for the RL agent.
- **Tuning Hyperparameters:** Finding appropriate hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) for the chosen RL algorithm might require some experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals:  Practical application of core RL concepts such as rewards, states, actions, and policies.
- Game development using Pygame:  Hands-on experience building a simple game and integrating AI.
