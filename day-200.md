# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control via Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary self-balancing robotic arm using machine learning for control.  The focus will be on creating a simple, simulated environment to train a reinforcement learning agent to balance a virtual weight on the end of a virtual robotic arm.  This project emphasizes rapid prototyping and explores the core concepts of reinforcement learning within a constrained timeframe.  While a physical prototype isn't feasible within the timeframe, this provides a solid foundation for later physical implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), Gym (OpenAI Gym or a similar reinforcement learning environment framework), NumPy
* **Simulation Environment:** Pygame (for basic visualization) or a more sophisticated physics engine like PyBullet (optional, adds complexity)


## Features & Requirements

- **Simulated Robotic Arm:** A 1-DOF (degree-of-freedom) robotic arm model (can be extended to 2-DOF for added challenge).
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An agent trained using a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
- **Reward Function:** A reward function designed to incentivize the agent to keep the weight balanced.
- **Training and Evaluation:** A system for training the agent and evaluating its performance using metrics like balancing time.
- **Basic Visualization:** A visual representation of the arm and weight's movement within the simulation.


- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementation of a more complex reward function incorporating energy efficiency.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integration of a more realistic physics engine (PyBullet).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the robotic arm model, physics, and reward function within the chosen simulation environment. This involves creating classes and functions to represent the arm, weight, and physics interactions.
2. **Agent Design:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (DQN is recommended for simplicity) and implement the agent's architecture using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
3. **Training Loop:**  Implement a training loop that iteratively interacts with the environment, trains the agent based on the received rewards, and saves the trained model.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's ability to balance the weight for a specified duration.  Collect metrics and visualize performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  Integrate basic visualization using Pygame to observe the arm's movements during training and evaluation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal balancing behavior without creating undesirable side effects can be challenging.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the reinforcement learning algorithm might require experimentation and iteration, potentially exceeding the daily timeframe if not carefully managed.  Start with default values and focus on functionality.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Gain practical experience in implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.
- **Simulation and Control:**  Develop skills in creating a simplified physics simulation and designing a controller for a robotic system.
