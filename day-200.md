# Minimalist Robotic Arm Trajectory Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified trajectory planner for a robotic arm, optimized for speed and minimizing computational overhead.  The goal is to create a system that can generate smooth, collision-free paths for a 2-DOF (degrees of freedom) robotic arm given a starting and ending point, suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. This is significant because efficient trajectory planning is crucial for real-time robotic control applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for optimization), Matplotlib (for visualization)
* **Optional:**  Robotics Simulation Environment (e.g., PyBullet, V-REP) for testing and visualization.

## Features & Requirements

- **Point-to-Point Trajectory Generation:**  Generate a smooth trajectory between a defined start and end point in the robot's workspace.
- **Collision Avoidance (Simplified):**  Implement basic collision avoidance by ensuring the arm stays within predefined workspace boundaries.
- **Trajectory Smoothing:** Utilize a suitable algorithm (e.g., cubic splines) to ensure smooth joint movements, minimizing jerk and acceleration.
- **Visualization:**  Display the generated trajectory visually using Matplotlib.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and report the trajectory's total time and maximum joint velocities.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporate a simple obstacle avoidance algorithm (e.g., potential fields).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a more sophisticated trajectory optimization algorithm (e.g., using dynamic programming or gradient descent).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Robot Kinematics:** Model the 2-DOF robot arm's kinematics (forward and inverse) using NumPy.
2. **Trajectory Generation:** Implement a cubic spline interpolation algorithm to generate a smooth trajectory between the start and end points.
3. **Collision Detection:** Add basic collision checks by comparing the arm's joint angles with workspace limits.
4. **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib to plot the robot arm's trajectory in its workspace.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Calculate and display the trajectory's duration and maximum joint velocities.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Optimization Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate algorithm for trajectory smoothing and optimization that balances complexity with computational efficiency.
- **Handling Complex Workspaces:** Extending the collision avoidance to handle more complex workspace geometries (if advanced features are implemented) can add significant complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Kinematics and Trajectory Planning:**  This project provides hands-on experience with fundamental robotic concepts, specifically forward and inverse kinematics and trajectory generation.
- **Practical Application of Optimization Algorithms:**  The project allows for practical exploration of different optimization techniques for trajectory generation, improving understanding of their trade-offs.
