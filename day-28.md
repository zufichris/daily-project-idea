# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing micro-gestures captured via a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures performed in front of the camera and trigger pre-defined actions within a simulated smart home environment. This project is significant because it explores a more intuitive and hands-free approach to interacting with smart home devices.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking), Flask (optional: for web interface)
- **Tools:**  Webcam,  Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., hand wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for volume up, thumbs down for volume down).
- **Action Triggering:**  Map recognized gestures to specific actions within a simulated smart home environment (e.g., controlling virtual lights, volume, etc.).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process video frames and trigger actions with minimal latency.
- **User Calibration:**  Option for users to calibrate their gestures to improve accuracy.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Log gesture data for training and analysis.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).
2. **Gesture Capture & Processing:** Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe and define thresholds for gesture recognition based on hand landmarks.
3. **Action Mapping:** Create a mapping between recognized gestures and simulated smart home actions.  Use a simple dictionary or configuration file.
4. **Real-time Control Loop:**  Integrate the gesture recognition and action triggering into a loop processing webcam frames continuously.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different users and lighting conditions, refining gesture thresholds and action mapping as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy & Robustness:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in lighting, hand size, and individual hand shapes.  Careful thresholding and potential use of more advanced machine learning techniques may be necessary.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing video frames in real-time while maintaining low latency requires efficient code and algorithm optimization.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of computer vision principles and libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Practical experience in developing real-time applications using video processing and event handling.
