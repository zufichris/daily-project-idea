#  Miniature Robot Obstacle Avoidance with Dynamic Path Planning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a miniature robot (simulated or physical) capable of autonomously navigating a simple obstacle course using dynamic path planning. The goal is to implement a robust and efficient algorithm that allows the robot to adapt to unexpected obstacles and find an optimal path to a target location within a constrained environment.  This project emphasizes practical application of pathfinding algorithms and real-time responsiveness.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  Pygame (for simulation), RPi.GPIO (if using a physical robot), NumPy (for numerical computation), a pathfinding library like `pathfinding` or `networkx`.
* **Hardware (Optional):** A small, mobile robot platform (e.g., Arduino-based robot), ultrasonic sensors.
* **Software (Optional):**  ROS (Robot Operating System) for more complex robot control (advanced option).


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Detection:**  The robot should detect obstacles using simulated sensors (in simulation) or physical ultrasonic sensors (in a physical implementation).
- **Path Planning:** Implement an A* search algorithm or a similar algorithm to find a path from the robot's starting point to a designated target location, avoiding detected obstacles.
- **Dynamic Path Adjustment:** The algorithm should dynamically replan the path if new obstacles are detected during navigation.
- **Real-time Navigation:** The robot should navigate in real-time, reacting to changes in the environment with minimal delay.
- **Visualization:**  Display the robot's path, obstacles, and target location visually, either through Pygame's graphical capabilities or a simple text-based output.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a smoother pathfinding algorithm, such as RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree*), for more efficient and natural navigation.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Integrate a camera for visual obstacle detection and avoidance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the project environment, installing necessary libraries and creating the simulation environment (using Pygame) or connecting to the physical robot hardware.
2. **Obstacle Detection Implementation:** Implement obstacle detection using simulated sensors or connect and calibrate physical ultrasonic sensors.
3. **Pathfinding Algorithm Integration:** Integrate the chosen pathfinding algorithm (A*, RRT*, etc.) and test its functionality on a simple map.
4. **Dynamic Path Adjustment:** Implement the logic to dynamically replan the path if new obstacles are detected during navigation.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the robot's navigation capabilities in various scenarios and refine the algorithm for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:** Pathfinding algorithms can be computationally expensive, especially for complex environments.  Consider optimizing the algorithm or simplifying the environment to improve real-time performance.
- **Sensor Noise:** Physical sensors can be noisy, leading to inaccurate obstacle detection. Implementing sensor fusion or filtering techniques might be necessary to improve the robustness of the system.


## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces practical understanding of pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*) and their implementation in a dynamic environment.
- It provides hands-on experience with sensor integration, real-time control, and the challenges of developing autonomous navigation systems.
