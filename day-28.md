# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The focus will be on rapidly prototyping and iterating on the RL agent's performance within a limited timeframe.  The game itself will be deliberately simplistic to allow for quick development and focused experimentation with RL techniques.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Game Development Library:** Pygame
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar)
* **Optional:**  TensorBoard for visualization

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple 2D Game:** A basic game like Pong or a simplified version of Snake.
- **RL-controlled Opponent:** The AI opponent will use an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C) to learn optimal strategies.
- **Training Environment:** A self-contained environment for training the RL agent.
- **Game Visualization:** Real-time display of the game and agent's performance.
- **Basic Scorekeeping:** Tracking the scores of the player and AI.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a reward shaping mechanism to improve learning speed and efficiency.
- **Advanced Feature:** Explore different RL algorithms and compare their performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development (2 hrs):** Create a basic 2D game using Pygame. Focus on core gameplay mechanics and a simple visual representation.
2. **Environment Setup (1 hr):**  Define the game state, actions, and reward function for the RL environment.  This should be designed to interface cleanly with the RL library.
3. **RL Agent Integration (2 hrs):** Integrate a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., PPO from Stable Baselines3) and begin training the agent.
4. **Training & Evaluation (3 hrs):** Train the agent for a set number of episodes. Monitor its progress and adjust hyperparameters as needed. Evaluate the agent's performance against a simple baseline (e.g., random actions).
5. **Refinement & Testing (2 hrs):** Refine the game logic, agent parameters, and reward function based on initial performance. Conduct further testing and evaluation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function is crucial for successful training.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal agent behavior.  Experimentation is key.
- **Training Time:** RL training can be computationally expensive.  Adjusting the training parameters (number of episodes, learning rate, etc.) will be necessary to ensure progress within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:** Gain hands-on experience with implementing and training an RL agent.
- **Game Development Fundamentals:** Improve skills in building a simple game using Pygame and integrating it with external libraries.
