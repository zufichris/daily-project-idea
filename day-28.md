# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The game will be a simplified version of a classic, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing of RL algorithms. The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL within a short timeframe, showcasing the power and efficiency of RL algorithms in solving simple decision-making problems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A custom-built, simple 2D game environment (e.g., grid-based navigation to a goal, avoiding obstacles).
- **RL Agent:** An agent using a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
- **Training Loop:** A training loop to allow the agent to learn through interaction with the environment.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics to track the agent's learning progress (e.g., average reward per episode, success rate).
- **Visualization:** Simple visualization of the agent's actions and progress within the game.

- **Advanced Feature:** Incorporate a simple neural network as a function approximator for the Q-function.
- **Optional Feature:** Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game rules, state space, action space, and reward function. Implement the game environment using Python.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning initially) and implement the agent's logic to interact with the environment.
3. **Training Loop Development:**  Implement the training loop that iteratively allows the agent to learn from interactions with the environment, updating its Q-values.
4. **Performance Evaluation & Visualization:** Add code to track relevant metrics and visualize the agent's progress.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Test the agent, and analyze its performance. If time allows, experiment with the advanced or optional features.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) might require some experimentation and iterative adjustments.
- **Environment Complexity:**  Balancing the simplicity of the environment with enough complexity to make the problem challenging yet solvable within the timeframe is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like Q-learning, reward functions, exploration-exploitation trade-off, and the training loop.
- **Practical Application of RL:**  Participants will gain hands-on experience applying RL to a concrete problem, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
