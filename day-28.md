# Efficient Pathfinding for a Simulated Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated robot navigating a 2D environment with obstacles.  The goal is to develop a system that finds the shortest or most efficient path quickly, even with a dynamically changing environment. This is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, with applications in autonomous vehicles, warehouse automation, and more.  The daily challenge will be to implement and test different pathfinding algorithms and analyze their performance.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for visualization), NetworkX (optional, for graph representation and algorithms)

## Features & Requirements

- **Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the A* search algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- **Obstacle Representation:**  Represent obstacles in the environment as a 2D array or a similar data structure.
- **Visualization:** Display the environment, obstacles, and the calculated path using Pygame.
- **Start and Goal Input:** Allow the user to specify the robot's starting and goal positions.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a simple path smoothing algorithm to reduce the number of sharp turns in the generated path.

- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling (Advanced):**  Allow for the addition or removal of obstacles during runtime, requiring the robot to recalculate its path.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the 2D environment using Pygame, including static obstacles.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* algorithm, using a suitable heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance).
3. **Path Visualization:**  Display the generated path on the Pygame screen, highlighting the start, goal, and obstacles.
4. **User Interaction:** Allow the user to specify the start and goal points with mouse clicks or keyboard input.
5. **Performance Testing (Optional):**  Measure the runtime of the pathfinding algorithm for different map sizes and obstacle densities.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Heuristic Choice:** Selecting an appropriate heuristic function is crucial for the efficiency of the A* algorithm. Experimentation with different heuristics might be necessary.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:**  Implementing dynamic obstacle avoidance requires a robust mechanism to detect changes in the environment and efficiently recalculate the path.  This could involve re-running the algorithm or using incremental search techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Pathfinding Algorithms:** This project solidifies understanding of the A* search algorithm, its principles, and implementation details.
- **Practical Application of Simulation:**  Gain experience in using Pygame for simulation and visualization, which is a crucial skill in robotics and AI development.
