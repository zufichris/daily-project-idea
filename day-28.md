# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately determine the robot's end-effector position in 3D space using a camera and image processing techniques. This is crucial for precise manipulation tasks and avoids the need for complex, pre-programmed calibration procedures.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computing), potentially a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, pySerial depending on the specific arm).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple one), a webcam or camera, a checkerboard or other known pattern for calibration.


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture images from the camera and detect the checkerboard pattern using OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners` function.
- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera using the detected checkerboard points to obtain intrinsic and distortion parameters.
- **3D Point Reconstruction:** Use the camera parameters and the checkerboard coordinates to reconstruct 3D points in the camera's coordinate system.
- **Robot Arm Position Estimation:**  Relate the 3D points to the robot's end-effector position, potentially requiring a transformation matrix based on the robot's physical setup.
- **Error Calculation and Refinement:**  Compare the estimated position with the actual robot position (if known) and quantify the error.


- **Advanced Feature:** Implement an iterative calibration process to minimize the error.
- **Optional Feature:** Incorporate a simple GUI for visualization and parameter adjustment.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and connect the camera and robotic arm.
2. **Camera Calibration:** Capture images of the checkerboard at different angles and use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function to determine camera parameters.
3. **3D Point Reconstruction:** Use the obtained parameters to reconstruct the 3D position of the checkerboard corners.
4. **Robot Arm Position Mapping:** Relate the 3D points to the robot's joint angles and end-effector position. This step may require a transformation matrix derived from the robot's kinematic model (simplified for a single day project).
5. **Calibration Validation:** Move the robotic arm to a known position, capture an image, and compare the estimated position with the actual position to assess accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accurate Robot Arm Model:** Obtaining an accurate kinematic model for the robot arm might be challenging if a complex arm is used; simplifying the model might be necessary for a one or two-day project.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can affect the accuracy of the checkerboard detection.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience in camera calibration, image processing, and 3D point reconstruction.
- **Gain experience in integrating computer vision with robotics:**  The project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision for improving the accuracy and control of a robotic arm.
