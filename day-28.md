# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Webcam

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet effective real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam.  The system will detect and track a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the webcam's field of view and display the object's coordinates on the screen.  This is a valuable exercise in integrating computer vision libraries and demonstrating basic object recognition principles.  The focus is on speed and efficiency for rapid prototyping.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (optional for classification)
- **Tools:**  A webcam (integrated or external), a Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Capture and display the webcam feed.
- **Object Detection:** Identify a specific object (e.g., color-based detection for simplicity).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Coordinate Display:** Display the object's (centroid) x, y coordinates on the video feed.
- **FPS Display:** Show frames per second (FPS) to gauge performance.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement basic object classification using a pre-trained model (TensorFlow/Keras).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a bounding box around the tracked object.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Webcam Access:** Install OpenCV and test webcam access. Capture and display the webcam feed.
2. **Object Detection (Color-based):** Implement color thresholding (e.g., HSV color space) to isolate the target object. Find contours and identify the largest contour representing the object.
3. **Object Tracking:**  Use techniques like Kalman filtering (simple implementation) or optical flow to track the object's movement across frames. Calculate the centroid.
4. **Coordinate and FPS Display:** Overlay the object's coordinates and the FPS on the video feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **(Optional) Object Classification:** Integrate a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet) for object classification if aiming for the advanced feature.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms.  Consider using simpler tracking methods for a day's challenge.  Optimize code for speed.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can affect color thresholding accuracy.  Explore different color spaces and thresholding techniques.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of OpenCV:**  Hands-on experience with image processing, object detection, and video manipulation techniques.
- **Practice with real-time processing:** Gain practical skills in building responsive applications with limited computational resources.
