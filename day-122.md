# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves developing a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it. The focus will be on rapid prototyping and achieving basic functionality within a short timeframe.  The game's simplicity allows for quick iteration and experimentation with different RL algorithms.  This project demonstrates practical application of RL and provides a foundation for more complex projects.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- Stable Baselines3 (for RL algorithms)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- Jupyter Notebook (or similar IDE)

## Features & Requirements
- **Game Engine:** A simple 2D game (e.g., a single-screen maze navigation or a simple platformer).
- **RL Agent:** An agent trained using a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
- **Training Loop:** Implementation of a training loop to iteratively improve the agent's performance.
- **Reward System:** Definition of a clear reward structure to guide the agent's learning.
- **Visualization:** Basic visualization of the game and the agent's progress.

- **Advanced Features:**  Saving/loading trained models.  Implementing different RL algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN) for comparison.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Design & Development:** Design and implement a minimal 2D game using Pygame. Focus on simplicityâ€”a few sprites, straightforward rules.
2. **Environment Wrapper:** Create a wrapper to interface between the Pygame game and the RL environment (Stable Baselines3).  This will translate game states into observations and actions.
3. **Agent Training:** Train the RL agent using a chosen algorithm (PPO is recommended for its relative ease of use).  Experiment with hyperparameters to find a reasonable balance between training time and performance.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance by letting it play the game without training.  Analyze its success rate and identify areas for improvement.
5. **Visualization & Refinement:** Enhance the visualization to better track the agent's learning and refine the game or reward function based on observations.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Creating an effective reward function that guides the agent towards desirable behavior can be tricky.  Experimentation and iterative refinement are crucial.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm may require some experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust based on performance.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning principles.
- Experience with building a simple game engine and integrating it with an RL framework.
- Understanding of the trade-offs between RL algorithm choices and hyperparameter tuning.
