# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus will be on creating a functional prototype demonstrating the basic principles of RL rather than achieving superhuman performance.  This allows for a tangible result within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  Gym (for environment creation if needed), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL model), NumPy
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - Game Environment: A functional implementation of the chosen game (Tic-Tac-Toe for simplicity).
    - RL Agent: An agent trained using a simple RL algorithm like Q-learning or SARSA.
    - Training Loop: A loop to train the agent against itself or a simple rule-based opponent.
    - Evaluation: A function to evaluate the agent's performance against a random opponent.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Visualization: Basic visualization of the game state and agent's policy.
    - Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different learning rates, discount factors, etc.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game's rules and state representation (e.g., a 3x3 array for Tic-Tac-Toe).  If using Gym, create a custom environment; otherwise, implement the game logic directly.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning recommended for simplicity) and implement the agent's logic, including actions, reward function, and state-action value updates.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop where the agent plays against itself (self-play) or a simple opponent, updating its policy based on the results.
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a random or rule-based opponent to assess its learning progress.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** Add basic visualization to show the game's progression and the agent's choices.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for successful learning. A poorly designed reward function can lead to unexpected or suboptimal agent behavior.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions) is essential for effective RL.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: Practical experience with core RL concepts like state, action, reward, and policy.
- Python Programming for AI:  Strengthening skills in Python programming for AI and ML tasks, including library usage and algorithm implementation.
