# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it effectively.  The game's simplicity allows for rapid prototyping and algorithm testing within a day or two, while incorporating RL introduces a challenging yet achievable element. The aim is to observe how an RL agent learns and adapts its strategy over time.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning), NumPy
- Tools:  A suitable Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a grid-based maze navigation or a simple platformer).
    - A basic RL agent (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA) to control the game character.
    - A reward system to guide the agent's learning (e.g., rewards for reaching goals, penalties for collisions).
    - Basic visualization of the game and agent's progress.
    - Data logging to track agent performance over time.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Introduction of multiple agents competing or cooperating.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Design and implement the core game mechanics using Pygame. This should include a simple game loop, player input (for initial testing), and basic rendering.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (start with Q-learning) and implement it to control the agent's actions within the game environment.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that allows the agent to play the game repeatedly, receiving rewards and updating its policy based on the chosen RL algorithm.
4. **Visualization and Logging:**  Implement visualization to display the game state and the agent's actions. Log key metrics (e.g., reward, steps taken) to track progress.
5. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance by letting it play the game without further training.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Shaping:**  Designing a suitable reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behaviour can be challenging. Experimentation and iteration may be needed.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the RL algorithm might require some trial and error.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement Learning fundamentals:  Gain practical experience implementing and applying core RL concepts.
- Game Development with Pygame: Enhance skills in game development and integrating AI into games.
