#  Miniature Smart Home Energy Management System

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a miniature smart home energy management system that monitors and simulates energy consumption of multiple devices within a constrained environment.  The goal is to build a functional prototype capable of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing energy data in real-time, even with simulated data.  This demonstrates fundamental concepts applicable to larger-scale smart home systems, data visualization, and IoT device management.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework/Library:** Flask (for a simple web interface),  Plotly (for data visualization), and a suitable library for interacting with simulated sensors (e.g., random number generators or a simple database for pre-recorded data).
* **Tools:**  A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), a web browser.

## Features & Requirements

- **Simulated Device Monitoring:**  The system should simulate the energy consumption of at least three different devices (e.g., lights, appliances, electronics).
- **Real-time Data Acquisition:**  Simulate energy usage data dynamically, updating every few seconds to mimic real-world variability.
- **Data Visualization:**  Display the energy usage of each device in an interactive dashboard using charts and graphs.
- **Energy Consumption Calculation:**  Calculate the total energy consumption and possibly the cost based on a simulated energy rate.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log the data to a file for later analysis.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement basic thresholds for high energy consumption alerts, and allow users to control simulated devices remotely through the web interface.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the development environment:** Install Python and necessary libraries (Flask, Plotly).
2. **Develop the data simulation component:** Create functions to generate random but realistic energy consumption data for each simulated device.
3. **Build the Flask web application:** Create a simple web server to display the data using Plotly charts and graphs.  This will include the real-time updating functionality.
4. **Integrate data simulation and visualization:** Connect the data simulation to the web application so the dashboard updates dynamically.
5. **(Optional) Implement data logging and remote control:** Add functionality to log data to a file and to remotely control the simulated devices.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time updates:**  Maintaining smooth real-time updates without causing performance bottlenecks will require careful consideration of data handling.
- **Data representation:**  Choosing an appropriate data structure and visualization method to clearly represent the data is important for a user-friendly interface.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Data visualization using Plotly:**  Gain practical experience in creating interactive data visualizations.
- **Building real-time web applications:**  Learn to construct a responsive web interface that updates dynamically with real-time data streams (even simulated ones).
