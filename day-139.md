# Mini-Game AI Agent using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Connect Four, using reinforcement learning. The focus is on creating a functional prototype demonstrating core RL concepts within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in experiencing the iterative development and rapid prototyping capabilities of reinforcement learning.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Libraries: Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- IDE: VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:**  A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or simplified Connect Four) with clear rules and win/loss conditions.
- **Agent Training:** Implementation of a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm to train the AI agent.
- **Agent Evaluation:**  A method to evaluate the agent's performance against a random opponent or a simple rule-based opponent.
- **Data Visualization:** Simple plotting of rewards or win rates during training to monitor progress.
- **Saving/Loading Model:** Ability to save and load the trained agent's model for later use.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementing an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for better exploration-exploitation balance.
- **Optional Feature:** Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame or similar.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple game environment using a library like Gym or by building a custom class. Define the state space, action space, reward function, and game logic.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning or SARSA). Implement the agent's logic for selecting actions, updating the Q-table/policy, and learning from experience.
3. **Training Loop:** Design a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updates the agent's knowledge, and tracks performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a baseline opponent (random or rule-based).
5. **Visualization & Saving:**  Visualize the training progress (e.g., plot rewards over time) and save the trained agent's model.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal play can be challenging.  Experimentation may be required.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the right balance between learning rate, exploration rate, and the number of training iterations can significantly impact performance.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning or SARSA).
- Understanding of the key components of a reinforcement learning system (agent, environment, reward).
- Skill in rapid prototyping and iterative development of AI agents.
