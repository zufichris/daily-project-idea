#  Miniature Autonomous Line-Following Robot Simulation

## Overview

This project involves creating a simulated miniature autonomous line-following robot using a physics engine and a simple AI algorithm. The goal is to design a robot that can efficiently navigate a virtual track defined by a black line on a white background.  This project is significant as it allows for rapid prototyping and testing of different control algorithms without the need for physical hardware, reducing development time and cost.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Physics Engine:** Pygame
- **AI Algorithm:**  Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller
- **IDE:** Any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements

- **Line Detection:** The robot should accurately detect the black line on the white background using image processing techniques.
- **Motor Control:** The robot should have simulated motors that can be controlled independently to adjust its direction.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to adjust motor speeds based on the robot's deviation from the line.
- **Track Navigation:** The robot should successfully navigate a predefined track (a simple curved line) without leaving the path.
- **Performance Metrics:** The code should track and display metrics like track completion time and deviation from the center of the line.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a simple obstacle avoidance system.  If a virtual obstacle is placed on the track, the robot should detect it and navigate around it.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Allow for user adjustable PID controller gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to allow experimentation with different control parameters.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install Pygame and any necessary libraries.  Create the basic window and robot sprite using Pygame.
2. **Line Detection:** Implement a simple image processing algorithm (e.g., thresholding) to detect the black line from the background.
3. **Motor Control & Movement:** Implement basic motor control functions to move the robot based on the line detection results.
4. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a PID controller to adjust motor speeds based on the error (distance from the center of the line).
5. **Track Generation & Testing:** Create a simple curved line as a track and test the robot's ability to follow it using the PID controller.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Tuning PID Controller:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and might require iterative adjustment.  Start with conservative values and gradually increase them.
- **Accurate Line Detection:**  Robust line detection in varied lighting conditions or with noisy images can be difficult.  Consider using more advanced image processing techniques if time allows.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce PID Control:** This project provides practical experience in implementing and tuning PID controllers, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Master Pygame Fundamentals:**  Develop proficiency in using Pygame for simulation and game development, enhancing understanding of sprite manipulation and event handling.
