# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning. The focus is on building a functional, albeit rudimentary, AI within a short timeframe, showcasing the core concepts of RL without extensive complexity.  The significance lies in demonstrating the power and accessibility of RL for game AI development.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `gym`, `stable-baselines3` (or a similar RL library like `TensorFlow Agents`)
- IDE:  VS Code, PyCharm (or similar)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) with a human-playable interface.
    -  An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization).
    -  Ability to play against the AI agent.
    -  Basic performance metrics tracking (e.g., win rate).
    -  Saving and loading of trained models.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Implementation of different RL algorithms for comparison.
    -  Visualization of the learning process (e.g., plotting win rate over training episodes).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment using a library like `gym` or a custom implementation. This should handle game state, moves, and win/loss conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO from `stable-baselines3`) and implement the AI agent.  Focus on a simple, readily available algorithm.
3. **Training:** Train the agent for a reasonable number of episodes (adjust based on time constraints). Experiment with hyperparameters if time permits.
4. **Testing & Evaluation:** Play against the trained agent and evaluate its performance.  Observe its decision-making process.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time allows, explore different RL algorithms or hyperparameters to improve performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require experimentation and could be time-consuming.  Start with default values and iterate if possible.
- **Computational Resources:** Training a complex RL agent can be computationally expensive. Simplify the game or reduce the training episodes if computational power is limited.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning concepts: This project reinforces understanding of core RL principles like reward functions, state-action spaces, and policy optimization.
- Practical application of RL libraries: Hands-on experience using RL libraries like `stable-baselines3` will strengthen practical skills in implementing and deploying RL algorithms.
