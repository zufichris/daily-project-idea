# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera.  The system will detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view and track its movement, displaying the object's location on the screen and potentially logging its trajectory. This project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision and embedded systems in a compact, easily deployable system.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model with camera support), USB webcam (optional, if not using the Pi Camera).
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV library, TensorFlow Lite (for model inference - optional, could use a simpler model), Raspberry Pi OS.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement frame by frame.
- **Position Display:** Overlay the detected object's bounding box and/or coordinates on the camera feed.
- **Data Logging (optional):** Record the object's (x, y) coordinates over time.
- **User Interface (optional):** Provide a simple interface to adjust parameters such as the detection threshold.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite if using), configure the camera, and test the camera feed.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement object detection using either a pre-trained model (e.g., a simple color-based detection for a red ball) or a lightweight TensorFlow Lite model.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., optical flow or a simple centroid tracker) to track the detected object across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and/or coordinates on the camera feed to display the object's location.
5. **Data Logging (optional):** Implement data logging if chosen, saving the object's position to a file.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:**  Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the frame rate, especially with complex detection models.  Consider using a simplified detection method or reducing the image resolution.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Varying lighting conditions can affect the accuracy of object detection.  Preprocessing techniques like adaptive thresholding may be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with object detection and tracking algorithms.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:** Develop skills in working with hardware (Raspberry Pi and camera) and integrating it with software for real-time applications.
