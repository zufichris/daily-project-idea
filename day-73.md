# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic self-balancing robotic arm using a microcontroller and sensor data. The goal is to implement a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to stabilize the arm at a desired angle, showcasing real-time control and feedback mechanisms.  This is a simplified version focusing on a single degree of freedom, making it feasible for a 1-2 day challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (with sufficient GPIO pins).
* **Sensor:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU) for angle and angular rate measurement.
* **Actuator:** Servo motor for arm control.
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Libraries:**  Wire.h (for I2C communication with the MPU6050), Servo.h (for servo control).

## Features & Requirements

- **IMU Data Acquisition:** Read accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050.
- **Angle Calculation:**  Fuse accelerometer and gyroscope data using a complementary filter for accurate angle estimation.
- **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller to maintain the desired arm angle.
- **Servo Control:**  Use the PID output to control the servo motor and adjust the arm position.
- **Setpoint Control:** Allow setting the desired angle through a serial interface (e.g., serial monitor).

- **Advanced Features:** (Optional) Add a simple user interface (e.g., a potentiometer for setting the desired angle).
- **Advanced Features:** (Optional) Implement automatic calibration to account for sensor biases and offsets.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the Arduino. Verify all connections and power supply.
2. **Sensor Calibration & Data Acquisition:**  Write code to read raw sensor data from the MPU6050. Calibrate the sensor to compensate for any biases. Implement the complementary filter for stable angle estimation.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement the PID algorithm.  Start with simple tuning parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) and iterate for optimal performance.
4. **Servo Control Integration:** Integrate the PID output to control the servo motor, ensuring the arm moves smoothly towards the desired angle.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the system with different setpoints and fine-tune the PID parameters to achieve stable and responsive control.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments and potentially more sophisticated tuning techniques (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method).
- **Sensor Noise:**  Dealing with sensor noise and drift is crucial for accurate angle estimation and stable control.  Implementing appropriate filtering techniques is necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Control Systems:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing a real-time control system using feedback from sensors.
- **PID Control:**  Develop a strong understanding of PID control theory and its application in robotics.  Learn practical PID tuning techniques.
