# Mini-Game AI:  Procedural Level Generation for a Simple Platformer

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI for a 2D platformer game that procedurally generates levels.  The AI will focus on creating playable, but challenging, levels within a limited timeframe. This showcases both AI and game development skills within a constrained environment, perfect for a daily challenge.  The significance lies in exploring efficient procedural generation techniques for game design.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Game Library: Pygame (or similar lightweight 2D game library)
- AI Algorithm:  Randomized Prim's Algorithm (or similar maze generation algorithm with modifications for platforming)


## Features & Requirements
- **Level Generation:**  Generate a playable level with platforms, gaps, and a goal location using a randomized algorithm.
- **Level Difficulty:**  Incorporate a simple difficulty parameter to control the number of gaps, platform height variations, and overall level length.
- **Collision Detection:** Implement basic collision detection between the player (a simple rectangle) and platforms.
- **Player Movement:**  Basic player movement (left, right, jump).
- **Goal Detection:** Detect when the player reaches the goal location.

- **Advanced Features:** Add simple enemy placement (static or slow-moving),  visual enhancements (background, sprites).
- **Optional Feature:** Implement a scoring system based on time taken or path efficiency.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Set up the Pygame environment and create basic player and platform sprites.
2. **Level Generation:** Implement the chosen algorithm (e.g., Randomized Prim's) to generate a 2D array representing the level layout.  Adjust the algorithm parameters to control level complexity.
3. **Collision & Movement:**  Implement collision detection and basic player movement controls based on user input.
4. **Goal Detection & Display:** Add a goal location to the generated level and implement logic to detect when the player reaches it. Display the level on the screen.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the generated levels and refine the algorithm parameters to achieve a balance between challenge and playability.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm Complexity:** Balancing the randomness of the algorithm with the requirement for playable levels can be challenging.  Overly complex levels might be frustrating.
- **Collision Detection Optimization:** Efficient collision detection is crucial for smooth gameplay, especially with more complex levels or multiple objects.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of procedural generation techniques for game design.
- Practical experience with game development libraries and concepts like collision detection and player input handling.
