# Real-time Object Tracking with Gesture Control

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple system that tracks a specific object (e.g., a colored ball) in real-time using a webcam and controls its simulated movement based on hand gestures. This combines computer vision with gesture recognition, providing a practical demonstration of integrating these technologies.  The significance lies in its applicability to various fields like robotics, gaming, and assistive technologies.  The daily challenge focuses on building a functional prototype.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), Pygame (optional: for simple simulation)
* **Tools:**  Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection & Tracking:**  Real-time detection and tracking of a predefined object (color-based initially) within the webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Detection of simple hand gestures (e.g., open palm for "forward," closed fist for "stop") using MediaPipe.
- **Simulated Movement:**  The tracked object's simulated position (e.g., on a Pygame screen) updates based on the detected gestures.
- **User Interface:** Simple display showing the tracked object's coordinates and gesture recognition status.
- **Calibration:**  Ability to easily adjust the object's color threshold for robust tracking.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Object recognition using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO) instead of color-based tracking.
- More complex gesture recognition (e.g., multiple actions).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Object Detection Setup:** Implement OpenCV to capture webcam feed and define color thresholds to detect the target object. Track the object's centroid using OpenCV's tracking functions.
2. **Gesture Recognition Integration:** Integrate MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and classify predefined gestures.
3. **Gesture-Based Control:** Implement logic to map gestures to actions, influencing the object's simulated movement.
4. **UI Development:** Create a simple window using Pygame or a similar library to display the webcam feed, object coordinates, and gesture information.
5. **Calibration and Testing:** Allow user adjustment of color thresholds and test the system with various gestures and object positions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Object Tracking:**  Dealing with lighting changes, occlusions, and variations in object appearance.  Using advanced techniques like background subtraction or object feature tracking can mitigate this.
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  MediaPipe's accuracy may depend on background and lighting conditions. Testing and adjustment of gesture thresholds might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Gain experience with real-time object detection, tracking, and color thresholding using OpenCV.
- **Gesture Recognition & Integration:**  Learn to utilize MediaPipe for gesture detection and seamlessly integrate it with a computer vision application.
