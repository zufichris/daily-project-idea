# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified calibration procedure for a robotic arm using computer vision.  Instead of relying on manual calibration methods, which are time-consuming and prone to errors, this project leverages a camera to automatically determine the robot's end-effector pose and adjust its internal parameters accordingly. This is a crucial step in ensuring accurate and reliable robotic manipulation.  A simplified version focusing on a single degree of freedom is feasible within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), NumPy (for numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., `pySerial` if using a serial port, specific library based on arm's manufacturer)
- **Hardware:**  A robotic arm with controllable joints, a webcam or camera with a known intrinsic calibration, a checkerboard pattern or other identifiable marker.

## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture images from the camera, detect the marker, and extract its position and orientation.
- **Pose Estimation:** Use computer vision techniques (e.g., PnP algorithm) to estimate the 3D pose of the marker relative to the camera.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move to a specific target position based on the estimated pose.
- **Calibration Loop:** Iteratively adjust the robot's internal parameters (e.g., joint offsets) to minimize the error between the desired and actual end-effector pose.
- **Error Reporting:** Display the calibration error and progress visually.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a more robust error correction algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter).
- **Optional Feature:**  Support for multiple degrees of freedom in the robotic arm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:**  Connect the camera and robotic arm, install necessary libraries, and ensure communication between the computer and the robotic arm.  Load a pre-calibrated camera intrinsic matrix if available; otherwise, calibrate the camera separately using a checkerboard pattern.
2. **Marker Detection and Pose Estimation:** Write a function to capture images, detect the marker using OpenCV, and estimate its pose using a PnP algorithm (OpenCV provides this functionality).
3. **Robotic Arm Control:** Implement functions to control the robotic arm's movement based on the estimated pose.  This may require understanding the specific commands and communication protocol of your robotic arm.
4. **Calibration Loop:** Create a loop that iteratively moves the robotic arm to target positions, compares the estimated pose with the actual pose (obtained from the camera), and adjusts the robotic arm's internal parameters to minimize the error.  Start with a simplified single degree of freedom.
5. **Visualization and Reporting:** Display the current pose, error values, and calibration progress on the screen.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Pose Estimation:**  The accuracy of the calibration depends heavily on the accuracy of the pose estimation.  Ensure sufficient lighting and a well-defined marker.  Consider using a more advanced algorithm for robust pose estimation if necessary.
- **Robotic Arm Communication:** The specific communication protocol and control commands for the robotic arm can be challenging.  Consult the robotic arm's documentation carefully.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of computer vision techniques, specifically pose estimation using PnP.
- Practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic arm control, understanding the challenges of real-world sensor-actuator integration.
