# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn optimal strategies within a day or two. The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts.  The game will be text-based for simplicity, allowing focus on the AI implementation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Libraries: NumPy, Pygame (optional for visualization), a RL library like Stable Baselines3 or RLlib (choose one based on familiarity).

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple text-based game (e.g., a simplified version of tic-tac-toe or a maze navigation).
    - An RL agent capable of learning through trial and error.
    - A reward system designed to guide the agent towards optimal play.
    - Basic logging of the agent's performance metrics (e.g., average reward, win rate).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - A graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame for visualization.
    - Implementation of different RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Network).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Design & Environment:** Define the game rules, state space, action space, and reward function.  Implement the game logic in Python.
2. **RL Agent Selection & Initialization:** Choose an appropriate RL algorithm from the selected library.  Initialize the agent with default hyperparameters.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updates the agent's policy based on the rewards received, and logs performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance against a random or human opponent.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  If using Pygame, create a simple GUI to visualize the game and the agent's actions.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging and require iterative adjustments.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm might require experimentation and potentially exceed the timeframe, necessitating focus on default settings initially.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning concepts: Understanding the core components of RL (agent, environment, reward, policy).
- Practical application of RL libraries: Gaining hands-on experience using a chosen RL library for agent implementation and training.
