# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The goal is to create a functional, albeit basic, AI opponent that can learn through trial and error within a short timeframe. This demonstrates a fundamental RL concept in a manageable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `gym` (for environment creation, optional), `numpy`, a suitable RL library like `stable-baselines3` or a simpler custom implementation.

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An AI agent trained using a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler policy gradient method).
    - Basic gameplay functionality allowing human interaction.
    - The ability to train the AI agent and test its performance against a human or a random player.
    - Data logging of the training process (rewards, losses, etc.).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Visualization of the agent's learning process (e.g., plotting reward curves).
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game rules and create the game environment (using `gym` or a custom implementation). This involves defining states, actions, rewards, and the game's end conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on the current state.  If using a library, focus on adapting its simple API for the chosen game.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updating the agent's policy based on the received rewards.  Log relevant training data.
4. **Testing and Evaluation:**  Test the trained agent against a human player or a random agent to evaluate its performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  If time permits, create plots showing the agent's learning progress (rewards over time).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward function is crucial for successful training.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or unexpected behavior. Experimentation and adjustment might be necessary.
- **Computational Cost:** Depending on the chosen RL algorithm and the complexity of the game, training might be computationally expensive.  Simplifying the algorithm or reducing the training iterations might be necessary to meet the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
- Experience in designing and implementing a simple game environment.
- Understanding of the importance of reward shaping and its impact on agent learning.
