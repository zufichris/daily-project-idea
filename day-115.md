# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified self-balancing robotic arm controlled via a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The goal is to create a system where a small robotic arm, perhaps simulated or using a physical mini-arm kit, maintains a stable upright position despite disturbances. This project emphasizes practical PID tuning and real-time control, skills highly relevant in robotics and automation.  The short timeframe necessitates using readily available libraries and focusing on core functionality.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with NumPy and SciPy)
- **Robotics Simulation (Optional):** PyBullet or V-REP (if a physical robot isn't available)
- **Control Library:**  A Python library for PID control (e.g., a custom implementation or a readily available one).
- **Hardware (Optional):** A small robotic arm kit (e.g., Arduino-based) with appropriate sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope).


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position using feedback from an accelerometer or simulated equivalent.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to adjust the arm's actuators (motors or simulated joints) based on the angular deviation from the upright position.
- **Real-time Control Loop:** The control loop should run at a reasonable frequency (e.g., 50-100 Hz) to provide responsive control.
- **Visualization (Optional):** Visual feedback (plots of sensor readings and control signals) to monitor the system's performance.
- **Disturbance Rejection (Advanced):** The arm should be robust enough to withstand small external disturbances (e.g., a slight tap).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Simulation/Hardware Initialization:** Set up the simulation environment (if using one) or connect to and initialize the physical robotic arm. Install necessary libraries.
2. **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Implement code to read sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope readings or simulated equivalents).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement or utilize an existing PID control library. Tune the PID gains (K_p, K_i, K_d) experimentally.
4. **Control Loop Execution:** Create a control loop that reads sensor data, computes control signals using the PID controller, and sends these signals to the arm's actuators (or simulates actuator movement).
5. **Visualization & Testing:** Visualize sensor readings and control outputs. Test the system's stability and robustness against disturbances.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments. The Ziegler-Nichols method or other tuning techniques can be used.
- **Real-time Constraints:** Ensuring the control loop runs at a sufficient frequency to provide responsive control might require optimization of the code.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning PID controllers, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Real-time System Development:** Understand the challenges and techniques involved in developing real-time systems with tight timing constraints.
