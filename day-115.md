# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified intelligent traffic light system using a multi-agent approach.  The goal is to create a basic model that dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle density at each intersection. This allows for exploration of optimization strategies for traffic flow and serves as a foundation for more complex simulations.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `Pygame` (for visualization), `NumPy` (for numerical computation), `random` (for randomness in vehicle generation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Randomly generate vehicles with varying speeds and destinations entering the simulation at specified entry points.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light controller that switches between green and red based on vehicle density sensors (simulated).
- **Density Detection:** Simulate vehicle density sensors at each intersection using basic counting algorithms.
- **Visualization:** Display the simulation in a Pygame window, showing vehicles, traffic lights, and potentially vehicle queues.
- **Basic Statistics:** Track and display basic statistics such as average waiting time and throughput.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a more sophisticated traffic light control algorithm, such as a basic adaptive control system that dynamically adjusts the green light duration based on vehicle density.
- **Optional Feature:** Incorporate different vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses, emergency vehicles) with varying speeds and priorities.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Vehicle Generation:** Set up the Pygame window, define vehicle properties, and implement the logic for generating vehicles at random intervals and locations.
2. **Density Sensor Simulation:** Implement simple counters to track the number of vehicles at each intersection.
3. **Basic Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple timer-based traffic light controller.
4. **Visualization:** Integrate vehicle movement and traffic light state visualization using Pygame.
5. **Basic Statistics Collection:**  Calculate and display average waiting time and throughput.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Simplicity and Functionality:**  The simulation needs to be simple enough to implement within the time constraint but complex enough to demonstrate the core concept.  Focus on a minimal viable product.
- **Algorithm Optimization:**  For the advanced feature, implementing a sophisticated adaptive control system might require careful consideration of algorithm complexity to avoid slowing down the simulation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Multi-Agent System Design:** This project helps in understanding the design and implementation of simple multi-agent systems.
- **Practical Application of Simulation Techniques:**  The project provides hands-on experience in building and visualizing a discrete event simulation.
