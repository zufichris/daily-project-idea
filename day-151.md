# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, yet engaging, 2D game (e.g., a simplified version of Pong or Snake) and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to control one of the players.  The focus is on rapidly prototyping an RL agent and observing its learning progress within a short timeframe. This showcases fundamental RL concepts and iterative development within a constrained timeline.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch) for RL implementation.
- **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Engine:**  A functional 2D game environment (Pong or Snake are ideal choices).
- **RL Agent:** An agent trained using a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the agent through multiple game iterations.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the game and the agent's performance (score, actions).
- **Data Logging:** Basic logging of the agent's training progress (e.g., rewards, losses).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., SARSA) for comparison.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Adding a simple GUI to control training parameters.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Create the basic game using Pygame. Focus on minimal functionality to get a playable game running quickly.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement its core logic.
3. **Training Loop Integration:** Integrate the RL agent into the game loop, allowing it to interact with the environment and learn.
4. **Visualization & Logging:** Add basic visualization and logging to monitor the agent's learning progress.
5. **Evaluation & Refinement:**  Evaluate the agent's performance. If time permits, iterate on the agent's hyperparameters or algorithm to improve its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Simplicity and Functionality:**  The challenge lies in creating a sufficiently complex game environment that is still simple enough to implement a basic RL agent within the time constraint.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the RL algorithm can be challenging and time-consuming.  Prioritizing quick prototyping over exhaustive hyperparameter optimization is key.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts such as states, actions, rewards, and Q-values.
- **Rapid Prototyping & Iterative Development:**  The project emphasizes efficient development and iteration within a limited timeframe, a crucial skill in software engineering.
