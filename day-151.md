# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a simple self-balancing robot arm using a microcontroller and sensor feedback. The goal is to create a system that maintains a stable upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating a basic understanding of PID control algorithms in a robotic context. This is a scaled-down version of a complex task, allowing a practical application within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (with sufficient memory)
- **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)
- **Sensors:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU for acceleration and angular velocity)
- **Actuator:** Servo motor (e.g., SG90)
- **Power Supply:** 5V power supply
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, potentially a plotting library for visualization.

## Features & Requirements
- **Self-Balancing:** The robot arm should maintain an upright position even when slightly disturbed.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to regulate the servo motor's angle based on IMU feedback.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide real-time feedback through serial communication (or LED indicators).
- **Calibration Routine:** A simple calibration procedure to adjust the initial position of the arm.
- **Stability under External Force (optional):**  The arm should demonstrate a degree of resistance to small pushes or taps.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the Arduino.  Calibrate the IMU to obtain accurate readings.
2. **IMU Data Acquisition:** Write code to read acceleration and gyro data from the MPU6050. Filter the raw data (e.g., using a complementary filter) to reduce noise.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a PID controller to calculate the required servo motor angle based on the current angle and desired angle (upright position).  Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) for optimal performance.
4. **Servo Motor Control:** Write code to control the servo motor angle based on the output from the PID controller.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system's stability. Adjust PID gains as needed to optimize performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments based on observing the system's response.
- **IMU Noise:** Filtering IMU data effectively is crucial to prevent instability caused by noisy sensor readings.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control:**  This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental control algorithm in robotics and automation.
- **Sensor Integration:**  It reinforces skills in integrating sensors (IMU) with a microcontroller to build a feedback control system.
