# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified traffic intersection with intelligent traffic light control, adapting to real-time vehicle density.  The simulation aims to explore basic traffic flow optimization algorithms and provide a visual representation of their impact.  This is a valuable exercise in algorithmic thinking and data visualization within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **IDE:**  Any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Randomly generate vehicles entering the intersection from different directions at varying intervals.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light cycle (e.g., fixed-time or basic actuated control).
- **Vehicle Movement:** Simulate vehicle movement through the intersection based on traffic light status.
- **Density Detection:**  Calculate vehicle density in each approach lane.
- **Visualization:** Display the simulation graphically using Pygame, showing vehicles, traffic lights, and density indicators.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated traffic control algorithm (e.g., a rudimentary adaptive control system adjusting cycle lengths based on density).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add vehicle types (cars, trucks) with varying speeds and sizes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Set up the Pygame environment and create basic window and drawing functions for vehicles and traffic lights.
2. **Vehicle Generation & Movement:** Implement vehicle generation and movement logic, ensuring vehicles stop at red lights and proceed at green lights.
3. **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple fixed-time traffic light control system.
4. **Density Calculation & Visualization:** Add density calculation for each lane and display it graphically.
5. **(Optional) Advanced Control:** Implement a more advanced traffic control algorithm if time permits.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Balancing algorithm complexity with the time constraint. Starting with a simpler algorithm and iterating is recommended.
- **Visualization Performance:**  Ensuring smooth visualization with a large number of vehicles might require optimization techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Designing and implementing algorithms for traffic flow optimization.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizing Pygame to create an effective visual representation of simulation data.
