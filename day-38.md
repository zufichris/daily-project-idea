# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Robot Arm

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simple system for real-time object detection and tracking using a camera feed,  integrated with a simulated robotic arm (e.g., using a library like PyBullet or V-REP). The goal is to have the robotic arm autonomously locate and "grasp" a predefined object within its workspace. This is a reduced-scope version of a complex robotic manipulation problem, achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for object detection, pre-trained model like YOLOv5 or MobileNet SSD recommended), PyBullet or V-REP (for robotic arm simulation).
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A webcam or pre-recorded video feed.  If using a real robot, appropriate drivers and libraries will be needed.

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:**  The system should accurately detect a specific object (e.g., a red cube) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:**  Once detected, the system should continuously track the object's position and orientation.
- **Arm Control:**  The simulated robotic arm should move to the detected object's location based on the camera coordinates.
- **Grasping (Simulation):** The simulated arm should attempt to "grasp" the object (simulation only; no physical interaction needed).
- **Basic UI:** A simple display showing the camera feed, object bounding box, and arm position.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a more robust object tracking algorithm to handle occlusion.  Add a simple path planning algorithm for the robot arm to avoid obstacles (if using a more complex simulated environment).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Object Detection:** Set up the environment, import necessary libraries, and load a pre-trained object detection model. Test object detection on a sample image or video feed.
2. **Object Tracking:** Integrate a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter or simple centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
3. **Robot Arm Integration:** Set up the simulated robot arm environment.  Establish a coordinate transformation between the camera's coordinate system and the robot arm's coordinate system.
4. **Control Loop:**  Implement a control loop that uses the tracked object's position to command the robotic arm's movement towards the object.
5. **Grasping Simulation:**  Implement basic grasping functionality in the simulation.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Accurately mapping the camera coordinates to the robot arm's coordinate system can be challenging.  Careful calibration or use of readily available calibration tools might be needed.
- **Real-time Performance:** Ensuring real-time performance with object detection and arm control might require optimization techniques, especially if using a less computationally efficient object detection model or a complex robotic arm simulation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gain practical experience in real-time computer vision and robotic control.
- Learn how to integrate different software libraries and tools for a complex task.  Reinforce understanding of coordinate transformation and control systems.
