# Mini-Game AI:  Procedural Level Generation for a Simple Platformer

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple 2D platformer game with procedurally generated levels using a limited set of tile assets. The AI will focus on generating levels that offer a balanced challenge, neither too easy nor impossibly difficult.  The goal is to build a functional prototype demonstrating procedural generation and basic game mechanics within a day or two.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with Pygame or Pyglet for game development)
* **Libraries:**  NumPy (for array manipulation), a suitable tilemap library (e.g., `pytmx`) if using a more complex tile system.
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), potentially a simple sprite editor for creating tile assets.


## Features & Requirements

- **Procedural Level Generation:**  The core functionality.  Levels should vary in layout and difficulty, with a focus on platforming challenges.
- **Basic Platformer Mechanics:** Player character movement (jumping, running), collision detection with platforms and obstacles.
- **Level Representation:**  A simple tile-based level representation (e.g., a 2D array or list).
- **Scoring System:**  Basic scoring based on level completion time or collected items.
- **Limited Tile Set:**  Restricting the number of tile types simplifies the implementation while still allowing for diverse level designs.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Enemy placement within the generated levels.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implementation of a simple difficulty scaling algorithm, adjusting level complexity based on the player's progress.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and create a basic project structure.  Choose your tile assets and create a simple player sprite.
2. **Implement basic game mechanics:** Create the player character with movement capabilities and collision detection.
3. **Develop the level generation algorithm:**  Start with a simple algorithm (e.g., random placement of platforms with constraints to ensure traversability).
4. **Integrate level generation with game mechanics:** Ensure the generated level is properly rendered and interacts with the player.
5. **Add scoring and basic UI elements:**  Implement a simple display for the score and a game-over condition.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:** Balancing level complexity and generation speed is a challenge.  Simple, efficient algorithms are preferred to allow for rapid prototyping within the timeframe.
- **Level Traversability:** Ensuring generated levels are always playable and don't contain unsolvable sections requires careful consideration of the level generation algorithm.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Procedural Content Generation:** Practical experience in creating algorithms for automatically generating game content.
- **Game Development Fundamentals:** Reinforces basic game development concepts such as game loop implementation, collision detection, and simple AI design.
