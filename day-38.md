# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a mini-game using reinforcement learning.  The chosen game will be a basic 2D environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration within a day or two.  The significance lies in applying a powerful AI technique to a concise problem, demonstrating the core concepts of RL and providing a tangible result.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development and visualization)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items).
    - An AI agent controlled by a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
    - A reward system that guides the agent's learning.
    - Basic game visualization using Pygame.
    - Ability to save and load the trained AI model.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    - Adding multiple AI agents with competitive or cooperative behaviors.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Design the Game Environment:**  Create a simple 2D game using Pygame, defining the game rules, rewards, and possible actions for the agent.
2. **Implement the RL Algorithm:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (start with Q-learning) and implement it using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
3. **Train the Agent:**  Run the training loop, allowing the agent to interact with the environment, learn from its experiences, and improve its performance over time.
4. **Test and Evaluate:**  Evaluate the agent's performance by observing its behavior in the game environment and assessing its ability to achieve the desired goals.
5. **Visualization and Refinement:**  Improve the visualization of the game and the agent's actions; refine the reward system or RL parameters to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding the optimal settings for the RL algorithm (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) can be challenging and may require experimentation.  Start with default values and iterate.
- **Reward Function Design:**  Creating a reward function that effectively guides the agent's learning is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to unexpected or suboptimal behavior.  Iterative refinement is key.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project provides hands-on experience with core RL concepts such as agents, environments, rewards, and learning algorithms.
- **Game AI Development:**  Participants will learn how to integrate AI into a game environment, using a practical approach to implement and evaluate agent performance.
