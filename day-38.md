# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robotic Object Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system that uses AI-powered image captioning to improve object recognition in a robotic arm's workspace.  The system will take an image from the robot's camera, generate a descriptive caption using a pre-trained model, and then use this caption to inform object manipulation tasks. This enhances the robot's ability to handle unseen or variably presented objects compared to relying solely on pre-programmed object recognition.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for image captioning), a Robotics library (e.g., ROS, MoveIt!)  (depending on the robotic arm used).
- **Pre-trained Model:**  A pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from Hugging Face's model hub).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm with a camera and basic control software (simulation environment can be substituted).

## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition:** Capture an image from the robot's camera.
- **Caption Generation:** Use a pre-trained image captioning model to generate a textual description of the image.
- **Object Identification:** Extract key objects and their attributes from the generated caption using NLP techniques (e.g., keyword extraction).
- **Task Planning:**  Based on identified objects, plan a simple manipulation task (e.g., pick and place).
- **Execution (Optional):** Execute the planned task using the robotic arm's control software.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a feedback loop to refine caption interpretation and task planning based on the robot's actions.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Incorporate object tracking to handle dynamic scenes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:**  Install necessary libraries, download a pre-trained image captioning model, and connect to the robotic arm (or set up a simulation).
2. **Image Acquisition & Captioning:** Write code to capture an image, preprocess it, and use the pre-trained model to generate a caption.
3. **NLP Processing:** Develop a basic NLP pipeline to extract key objects and their properties from the caption.
4. **Task Planning:**  Create a simple rule-based system to map object properties to basic manipulation tasks.
5. **(Optional) Execution & Feedback:** Integrate with robotic arm control to execute the task and potentially incorporate feedback (only if time allows and hardware is available).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models may not perfectly caption every image, requiring robust error handling and potentially custom model fine-tuning (beyond the scope of a daily challenge).
- **NLP Complexity:** Extracting meaningful information from captions requires careful consideration of NLP techniques and potentially advanced parsing.  A simplified approach might be sufficient for a daily project.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of pre-trained AI models:** This project provides hands-on experience integrating a pre-trained model into a robotics application.
- **Gain experience with NLP techniques:** The project involves basic NLP for object identification, introducing concepts like keyword extraction and potentially more advanced techniques if time allows.
