# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent using reinforcement learning to play a basic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.  The goal is to create a functional agent within a day or two, demonstrating a basic understanding of reinforcement learning principles and its implementation. The significance lies in showcasing the power of reinforcement learning in a concise, easily understandable application.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, optional), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning model), NumPy (for numerical operations).

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -   A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -   An AI agent that learns through reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning).
    -   The agent should be able to play against a human player.
    -   Basic training and evaluation capabilities.
    -   Output of the agent's win/loss/draw rate.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -   Visualization of the learning process (e.g., plotting win rate over time).
    -   Implementation of a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game rules and create a game environment (either manually or using OpenAI Gym). This involves creating functions to represent game states, moves, and win/loss conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Design and implement a Q-learning agent. This includes defining the state space, action space, Q-table (or neural network), and learning algorithm.  Focus on a simplified Q-learning implementation for the time constraint.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop where the agent plays multiple games against itself, updating the Q-table/neural network based on the rewards received.
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a random player or a human player.  Record win/loss/draw rates.
5. **Optional Visualization:** If time permits, plot the learning curve (win rate over training episodes).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**  Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting already learned knowledge is crucial for effective learning.  This can require careful tuning of exploration parameters (e.g., epsilon-greedy strategy).
- **State Representation:** Choosing an effective way to represent the game state is important for efficient learning.  A poorly chosen representation can lead to slow learning or poor performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core concepts in reinforcement learning, including Q-learning, state-action spaces, rewards, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma.
- **Practical Application of Machine Learning:**  The project provides practical experience in implementing and evaluating a simple machine learning model, gaining familiarity with libraries like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
