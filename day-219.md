# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures to control basic smart home functions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume). This addresses the growing demand for intuitive and accessible smart home interfaces beyond voice or touch controls.  The focus will be on a rapid prototype showcasing core functionality.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, NumPy
* **Framework:**  None (script-based)
* **Tools:**  Webcam, potentially a Raspberry Pi for a more embedded system approach (optional)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize predefined gestures (e.g., hand open/close, wave, thumbs up/down) from a webcam feed.
- **Smart Home Control Simulation:**  Map recognized gestures to simulated smart home actions (e.g., print "Lights ON," "Volume UP").  This simulates interaction with a real system without requiring actual smart home devices.
- **User Calibration:** Allow for basic calibration to adjust gesture recognition sensitivity to the user's hand size and movement.
- **Gesture Display:** Show a visual representation of the recognized gesture on the screen (e.g., overlay on webcam feed).
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where gestures are not recognized or are ambiguous.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Integration with a real smart home system (e.g., Home Assistant API).
- Machine learning-based gesture recognition model training for improved accuracy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy). Set up a webcam and test the connection.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect hand landmarks in real-time from the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Develop a simple logic (e.g., rule-based) to classify the detected hand landmarks into predefined gestures.
4. **Smart Home Simulation:**  Create a function that maps classified gestures to simulated smart home actions (print statements to the console).
5. **User Interface:**  Display the webcam feed and overlay the recognized gesture and simulated action.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of hand detection.  Consider using techniques to improve robustness to varying lighting conditions (image processing).
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Certain gestures may be difficult to distinguish from each other.  Carefully choose easily distinguishable gestures and consider using more sophisticated classification techniques for improved accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:**  Gain practical experience with real-time image processing and hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition Principles:**  Understand the fundamental concepts of gesture recognition and develop a simple gesture classification system.
