# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for a Smart Home Device

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a tinyML-based gesture recognition system that can control a smart home device (e.g., a smart light or fan). The system will utilize a microcontroller with onboard machine learning capabilities to process sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope data) in real-time, minimizing reliance on cloud processing.  The significance lies in achieving low-power, edge-based gesture control, increasing responsiveness and privacy.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or ESP32-S3
* **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE with TensorFlow Lite Micro libraries
* **Sensor:** Onboard accelerometer and gyroscope (already present in the chosen microcontrollers)
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Data Acquisition:** Capture accelerometer/gyroscope data for predefined gestures (e.g., wave for on/off, circle for brightness/speed control).
- **Model Training:** Train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow Lite Micro to classify gestures from the captured data.  A pre-trained model could be fine-tuned for faster results.
- **Real-time Gesture Classification:**  The microcontroller should process sensor data in real-time and classify gestures with minimal latency.
- **Smart Home Device Control:**  Interface with a smart home device (e.g., via Bluetooth or a digital output pin) to trigger actions based on the classified gestures.
- **Data Visualization (Optional):** Visualize the sensor data and classification results on a serial monitor or a connected display.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Gesture Customization:** Allow users to easily train new gestures.
- **Noise Filtering:** Implement algorithms to filter out noise from the sensor data.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect training data for at least three distinct gestures using the microcontroller's onboard sensors. Preprocess data (e.g., normalization, windowing).
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple CNN model in TensorFlow Lite Micro using the collected dataset. Optimize the model for size and speed.
3. **Model Deployment:** Convert the trained model into a format suitable for the microcontroller and deploy it.
4. **Real-time Classification & Control:** Integrate the model with the sensor data acquisition to perform real-time gesture classification.  Implement the logic to control the smart home device based on the classification results.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions.  Refine the model and parameters as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:** Obtaining a representative dataset with sufficient variations for robust gesture recognition.
- **Model Optimization:** Balancing model accuracy with its size and speed for real-time performance on a resource-constrained microcontroller.  Quantization techniques might be needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Implementation:** Hands-on experience with developing and deploying a machine learning model on a microcontroller.
- **Sensor Data Processing:** Practical application of sensor data acquisition, preprocessing, and feature engineering for real-time applications.
