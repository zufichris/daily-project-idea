# Smart Home Energy Optimization: A Micro-Controller Based Prototype

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic prototype of a smart home energy optimization system using a microcontroller. The system will monitor real-time energy consumption of a single appliance, identify peak usage times, and provide basic feedback to the user via an LED indicator.  This demonstrates core principles of embedded systems and IoT data acquisition.

## Technologies & Tools
- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano or ESP32 (preferred for Wi-Fi capabilities)
- Current sensor: ACS712 (or similar)
- LED indicator
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO for ESP32)
- (Optional)  ThingSpeak or similar IoT platform for data logging and visualization.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Energy Monitoring:**  Accurately measure and display the current power consumption of a connected appliance.
- **Peak Usage Detection:** Identify and record the highest power consumption within a predefined time window (e.g., 1 minute).
- **Visual Feedback (LED):**  An LED will indicate high energy consumption (e.g., bright red) vs. low consumption (e.g., dim green).
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Store the measured data on an SD card or transmit it to a remote server via Wi-Fi.
- **User-Configurable Thresholds (Optional):** Allow the user to set the high/low energy consumption thresholds.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the current sensor to the microcontroller, calibrate it for accurate readings, and wire the LED.
2. **Data Acquisition:** Write code to read the current sensor values and convert them to power consumption (Watts).  Implement a moving average filter to smooth out noisy readings.
3. **Peak Detection:** Implement an algorithm to track the maximum power consumption within a specified time window.
4. **LED Control:**  Map the power consumption to different LED brightness levels to provide visual feedback.
5. **Data Logging (Optional):** Implement code to store data to an SD card or transmit data to a cloud platform like ThingSpeak.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accurate Calibration:**  Properly calibrating the current sensor to obtain accurate power readings can be challenging and requires careful attention to detail.
- **Noise Filtering:**  Real-world sensor readings are often noisy. Implementing effective noise filtering is crucial for reliable results.


## Learning Outcomes
-  Reinforce practical skills in microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and data acquisition.
-  Develop an understanding of embedded systems design and real-time data processing.
