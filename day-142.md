# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus is on creating a robust and responsive system capable of recognizing a small set of pre-defined gestures within a limited timeframe. This is particularly useful for hands-free operation in situations where touch interaction is impractical or undesirable.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  pyautogui (screen control/simulation for testing).
* **Hardware:** Webcam (any USB webcam will suffice).
* **Optional:**  A small smart home device or simulator (e.g., Home Assistant API) for actual device control.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture & Processing:**  Real-time capture of webcam feed and processing to identify hand landmarks.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognition of 3-4 distinct gestures (e.g., "thumbs up" for lights on, "thumbs down" for lights off, fist for pause/play).
- **Device Control (Simulated):** Triggering predefined actions (e.g., simulating keystrokes to control a media player or sending simulated commands to a virtual smart home device).
- **User Interface (Basic):**  Displaying the recognized gesture and associated action on the screen (optional: live camera feed with gesture overlays).
- **Model Training (Simplified):**  Using a pre-trained model from MediaPipe and potentially fine-tuning with a small dataset of custom gestures if time allows.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Real-time Smart Home Integration:**  Direct control of actual smart home devices via their respective APIs.
- **Multiple User Support:** Distinguishing between different users based on hand/body features (requires more advanced computer vision techniques).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, pyautogui). Set up the webcam and test basic video capture.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand detection and tracking model.  Visualize hand landmarks on the camera feed to confirm correct detection.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Implement logic to classify detected hand poses into pre-defined gestures.  A simple threshold-based approach can suffice for a basic prototype.
4. **Action Triggering:** Implement the action associated with each gesture using `pyautogui` for simulated device control. (For advanced users, integrate with a real smart home API).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and hand positions.  Refine the gesture recognition thresholds or add more training data if needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to Lighting & Background:**  Variations in lighting and background clutter can significantly affect hand detection accuracy.  Experiment with different image processing techniques to mitigate this issue.
- **Accuracy & Precision:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition, especially with subtle hand movements, requires careful calibration and potentially advanced machine learning techniques.  Prioritize simplicity and functionality for a daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on experience with computer vision libraries:**  Gain practical experience using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Understanding of model selection and deployment:** Learn how to choose a pre-trained model that's suitable for the task and deploy it within a simple application.
