# Automated Code Style Checker with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to develop a lightweight, customizable code style checker that can analyze Python code and identify style violations based on a user-defined rule set.  This differs from existing solutions by prioritizing ease of customization for a specific project or team's style guide, even for very niche rules, making it suitable for a rapid prototyping daily challenge.  The focus is on rapid development and flexible rule implementation rather than exhaustive style coverage.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Tree parsing), `argparse` (for command-line argument parsing), potentially `pycodestyle` (for base style checks, though custom rules will be the focus).

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:** Users should be able to define custom style rules using a simple, easily parsable format (e.g., JSON or YAML).
- **Code Analysis:** The tool should parse Python code using the `ast` module and check for violations against the defined rules.
- **Reporting:** The tool should generate a clear report listing all style violations found, including line numbers and descriptions.
- **Command-Line Interface:**  The tool should be accessible via a command-line interface for easy use.
- **Customizable Severity:**  Users should be able to assign severity levels (e.g., warning, error) to each rule.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a code formatter to automatically fix identified violations.  Support for multiple file analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Rule Definition Structure:** Design and implement the structure for defining custom rules (e.g., JSON schema). Create a sample ruleset for testing.
2. **AST Parsing & Rule Matching:** Implement the core logic to parse Python code using `ast` and match the parsed nodes against the defined rules.
3. **Reporting Mechanism:** Develop the reporting functionality to output violation details in a clear and readable format.
4. **CLI Implementation:** Integrate `argparse` to build a command-line interface for specifying the code file and ruleset.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the tool with various code samples and refine the rule matching logic and reporting.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **AST Complexity:**  Handling complex Python AST structures efficiently and accurately requires careful consideration of edge cases.  Focus on a subset of AST nodes for the daily challenge scope.
- **Rule Definition Language Design:**  Balancing simplicity and expressiveness in the rule definition language is crucial.  Prioritize ease of use for the daily challenge.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of Python's `ast` module for code analysis.
- Practical experience in building command-line tools using Python.
- Improved skills in designing and implementing a flexible, customizable system.
