# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, game and implement a rudimentary AI opponent using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus is on rapid prototyping using a readily available game environment and a streamlined RL approach, highlighting the core concepts without getting bogged down in complexities.  The significance lies in experiencing the practical application of RL in a short time frame.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for game development)
- Stable Baselines3 (or similar RL library like RLlib)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:** A simple 2D game (e.g., Pong, a simplified version of Snake).
- **RL Agent:** An AI opponent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
- **Training Loop:**  A basic training loop that allows the agent to learn through interactions with the game environment.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the game and the agent's performance.
- **Basic Reward System:** A simple reward function to guide the agent's learning.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Saving and loading trained models. Implementing a more sophisticated reward function.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Using a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN) for comparison.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Game Environment:** Create a basic Pygame game.  Focus on simplicityâ€”a minimal playable version is sufficient.
2. **Define the RL Agent and Environment:** Wrap the Pygame game within a suitable environment for Stable Baselines3. Define the observation space, action space, and reward function.
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the training loop using PPO or chosen RL algorithm. Experiment with hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Test and Evaluate:** Observe the trained agent's performance against a simple rule-based AI or a human player.
5. **Refine (Optional):**  Iterate based on the results, adjust hyperparameters or reward function for better agent performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the right balance of hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) can be time-consuming. Start with default values and adjust incrementally.
- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function is crucial. A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal agent behavior.  Start with a simple reward function and refine it based on observations.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning principles.
- Experience with RL libraries like Stable Baselines3.
- Understanding the workflow of training and evaluating an RL agent.
