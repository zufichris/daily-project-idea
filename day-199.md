# Robotic Arm Calibration & Control via Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet robust, machine learning model to calibrate and control a robotic arm (physical or simulated) using only a few demonstration points.  The focus is on achieving accurate positional control without relying on complex kinematic models, making it suitable for rapid prototyping and testing within a short timeframe.  This is significant because it reduces the setup time and expertise needed for robotic arm applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Scikit-learn (for regression), Pygame (optional, for visualization/simulation)
* **Robotics Simulation (Optional):** PyBullet or V-REP (if using a simulated arm)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A small robotic arm with accessible control interfaces (e.g., Arduino-based).

## Features & Requirements

- **Calibration:**  Learn the relationship between motor angles and end-effector position using a small dataset of demonstration points.
- **Control:**  Given a target position, predict the required motor angles using the trained model.
- **Error Correction:**  Implement a basic feedback loop to compensate for minor positioning errors.
- **Data Acquisition:**  Use sensor data (if applicable, with hardware arm) or simulated positions to collect training data.
- **Visualization (Optional):** Display the robot arm's movements and target positions.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporate a more advanced regression model (e.g., Support Vector Regression, Random Forest) to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add obstacle avoidance functionality using sensor data (if using a physical arm).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:**  Collect a small dataset of (motor angles, end-effector position) pairs. This can be done manually by moving the arm to different positions and recording the data or using simulated data.
2. **Model Training:** Train a regression model (e.g., linear regression initially) using the collected dataset.  The input will be the motor angles, and the output will be the end-effector position.
3. **Control Implementation:**  Develop a function that, given a target position, uses the trained model to predict the required motor angles.  Send these angles to the robotic arm (physical or simulated).
4. **Error Correction:** Implement a simple feedback loop (e.g., proportional control) to adjust the predicted angles based on the difference between the target and actual positions.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system using various target positions and iterate on the model or feedback loop to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:**  The accuracy of the model heavily depends on the quality of the training data. Ensure precise data collection.
- **Noise Handling:** Real-world robotic arms are often subject to noise and disturbances. Robust error handling and filtering are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Regression Models:**  This project provides hands-on experience in applying regression techniques to a real-world problem.
- **Understanding of Robotic Control Fundamentals:** Gain insights into basic control concepts such as feedback loops and calibration techniques.
