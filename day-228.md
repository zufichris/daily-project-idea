# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection with intelligent traffic light control.  The simulation will dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle density at each approach, optimizing traffic flow and minimizing wait times. This project focuses on core algorithms and data structures, avoiding complex graphical rendering for a one- to two-day timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for basic visualization, optional).


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Simulate vehicles arriving at each approach of the intersection with varying arrival rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light control algorithm (e.g., a fixed-time cycle or a rudimentary adaptive algorithm based on vehicle counts).
- **Vehicle Movement:** Simulate vehicle movement through the intersection, respecting traffic light signals.
- **Data Collection:**  Collect data on vehicle wait times, throughput, and average queue lengths.
- **Basic Visualization (Optional):** Display a textual representation of the intersection state and vehicle movements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Structures:** Define data structures to represent vehicles (position, speed, arrival time), traffic lights (state, cycle time), and intersection geometry.
2. **Vehicle Generation:** Implement a function to generate vehicles at random intervals and assign them to different approaches.
3. **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light control algorithm. Start with a simple fixed-time cycle and consider adding a rudimentary adaptive control algorithm (e.g., prioritizing the approach with the longest queue) if time permits.
4. **Vehicle Movement:**  Implement vehicle movement logic, updating vehicle positions based on their speed and traffic light signals.
5. **Data Collection & Output:** Collect data on key metrics and output the results (e.g., average wait time, throughput) to the console or a simple text file.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Design:** Designing an efficient and effective traffic light control algorithm within the time constraints is challenging.  Start with a simple algorithm and iterate.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** Balancing simulation accuracy with development time requires careful consideration. Focus on core functionalities and avoid overly complex vehicle behavior modeling.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithm Design:** Reinforce skills in designing and implementing efficient algorithms for real-time systems.
- **Data Structures:** Practice using appropriate data structures for managing and manipulating simulation data efficiently.
