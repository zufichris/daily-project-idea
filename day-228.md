# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent using reinforcement learning (RL) to play a minimalistic game. The goal is to demonstrate a basic RL pipeline within a constrained timeframe, showcasing the core concepts and iterative improvement cycle.  The game will be a custom-designed text-based environment, making it easy to prototype and focus on the AI agent's development.  This is significant as it provides a hands-on approach to understand and implement RL, a powerful technique for AI development.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for RL algorithms), NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple text-based game environment with clear rules and rewards.  (e.g., navigating a grid to collect points, avoiding obstacles).
    - An RL agent using a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
    - Training loop to iteratively improve the agent's performance.
    - Basic visualization of the agent's actions and rewards during training.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).
    - Incorporating a simple GUI for better interaction.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Design the Game Environment:** Create a Python class representing the game's state, actions, and reward function. Keep it extremely simple (e.g., a 5x5 grid).
2. **Implement the RL Agent:** Choose a basic RL algorithm (Q-learning) and implement it using NumPy or a suitable RL library.
3. **Training Loop:** Write a loop to train the agent, iteratively interacting with the environment, updating the agent's policy, and observing performance.
4. **Visualization:** Add basic plotting (Matplotlib) to visualize the agent's learning progress (e.g., reward over time).
5. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent's performance against a random baseline.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal learning rates and exploration parameters for the RL algorithm might require experimentation.  Start with simple values and iterate.
- **Environment Complexity:** Balancing the simplicity of the environment with enough complexity to make the RL problem challenging yet solvable within the timeframe is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes
- Gain practical experience in implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Understand the core components of an RL pipeline: environment, agent, reward function, and training loop.
