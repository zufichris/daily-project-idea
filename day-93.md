# Mini-Project:  Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a basic real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera, leveraging the power of WebRTC for seamless browser-based interaction.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and track its movement within the camera's field of view, displaying the results directly in the browser. This serves as a foundational project for more complex applications involving augmented reality, robotics control, or human-computer interaction.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js for potential server-side components if needed for advanced features).
* **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow.js (for object detection), WebRTC (for real-time video streaming), potentially a JavaScript UI framework like React or Vue for enhanced user interface.
* **Tools:** A web browser (Chrome recommended), a webcam.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  Capture video from the webcam using WebRTC and display it in the browser.
- **Object Detection:** Utilize a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model (like MobileNet SSD) to detect the target object (e.g., a red ball) in each frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using centroid tracking) to follow the detected object's movement.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display bounding boxes around the detected object on the video stream, highlighting its position and trajectory.
- **FPS Display:** Show the frames per second (FPS) to monitor performance.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Server-side processing for improved performance and scalability (Node.js with a suitable framework).
- Integration with a robotic arm for object manipulation (requires additional hardware).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Video Streaming:** Set up the WebRTC connection to stream the webcam feed into the browser.
2. **Object Detection Model Integration:** Load and integrate a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model for object detection.
3. **Tracking Algorithm Implementation:** Implement a simple centroid tracking algorithm to follow the detected object.
4. **Visual Feedback & UI:** Overlay bounding boxes and FPS information on the video stream, creating a clear visual representation.
5. **Testing & Optimization:** Test the system with different objects and lighting conditions; optimize for performance if needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance:**  Balancing real-time processing with the computational demands of object detection can be challenging.  Consider using a lighter model or optimizing the tracking algorithm if necessary.
- **Accuracy:** Object detection models aren't perfect.  Dealing with potential false positives or missed detections requires robust error handling and potentially more advanced tracking techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforces understanding of real-time video processing techniques using WebRTC.**
- **Provides hands-on experience with TensorFlow.js for object detection and its application in browser-based projects.**
