# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a system that utilizes a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera to detect and track a specific object (e.g., a colored ball) in real-time. This involves integrating computer vision techniques with embedded system programming, demonstrating a practical application of object recognition and tracking in a resource-constrained environment.  The significance lies in its potential applications in robotics, surveillance, and automated systems.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (Model 4 or newer), USB camera
- **Software:** Raspberry Pi OS (with necessary libraries installed)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:** Continuously track the detected object's position as it moves.
- **Position Reporting:** Output the object's coordinates (x, y) in real-time to the console.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display bounding boxes around the detected object on the camera feed.
- **Color Calibration:** Allow for adjustment of color thresholds to improve detection accuracy for different lighting conditions.


**Advanced Features (Optional):**

- **Speed Measurement:** Calculate the object's speed based on its tracked movement.
- **Distance Estimation:**  Estimate the distance to the object using camera calibration and known object dimensions (requires additional calibration steps).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:**  Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) on the Raspberry Pi and connect the camera.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm using OpenCV's `inRange()` function to identify pixels corresponding to the target object's color.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's `cv2.Tracker` functions (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`) to track the detected object's centroid across frames.
4. **Data Output:** Print the object's (x, y) coordinates and optionally its speed or distance to the console.
5. **Visual Feedback:** Display the camera feed with bounding boxes around the tracked object using OpenCV's drawing functions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect color detection accuracy.  Careful calibration and potential use of adaptive thresholding may be necessary.
- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power may limit the frame rate, particularly with more complex tracking algorithms.  Optimization techniques might be required.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience in real-time object detection and tracking using OpenCV.
- **Develop skills in embedded system programming:** The project involves working with a Raspberry Pi and integrating hardware and software components, emphasizing resource management and efficiency.
