# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to design and implement a self-balancing robotic arm using a simple servo motor and an Arduino microcontroller. The focus is on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain the arm's balance despite external disturbances. This provides a practical application of control theory concepts within a constrained timeframe.  The significance lies in its educational value â€“ showcasing PID control implementation and the challenges involved in real-time robotic control.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller, servo motor (e.g., SG90), MPU6050 (6-axis IMU), breadboard, jumper wires, power supply.
* **Software:** Arduino IDE, C++ programming language.

## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain its upright position even when lightly nudged.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to regulate the servo motor's angle based on IMU readings.
- **IMU Data Acquisition:**  The MPU6050 should accurately capture angular acceleration and orientation data.
- **Servo Motor Control:**  The servo motor should precisely adjust its position based on the PID controller's output.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should respond to disturbances in real-time.

- **Advanced Features:** Data visualization of sensor readings and PID controller outputs (optional).
- **Optional:**  Implementation of a Kalman filter for noise reduction in IMU data.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the Arduino. Ensure proper power connections.
2. **IMU Calibration and Data Acquisition:**  Calibrate the MPU6050 and write code to read its acceleration and gyroscope data.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement a PID controller algorithm in C++ to adjust the servo motor angle based on the IMU feedback.  Start with simple gains and tune them iteratively.
4. **Servo Motor Control:**  Write code to control the servo motor's angle based on the PID controller's output.
5. **Testing and Tuning:**  Test the system's stability and tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal balance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Starting with low gains and gradually increasing them is recommended.
- **IMU Noise:**  The MPU6050 might produce noisy data.  Implementing filtering techniques (e.g., a simple moving average) can help mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:**  Gain practical experience in designing and implementing a PID controller for a real-world system.
- **Real-time Embedded Systems:**  Understand the challenges and techniques involved in developing real-time control systems using microcontrollers.
