# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of predefined micro-gestures (e.g., thumb-up for increasing volume, thumb-down for decreasing volume) for seamless and intuitive interaction.  This project is significant as it explores a novel interaction paradigm for smart home control, moving beyond traditional voice commands or touch interfaces.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  pyautogui (screen/system control),  a smart home API library (e.g., Home Assistant API)
- **Tools:** Webcam,  potentially a Raspberry Pi (for a more embedded solution)

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Capture:**  Capture a live video feed from the webcam using OpenCV.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Employ MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect and classify predefined micro-gestures.
- **Smart Home Control:** Integrate with a chosen smart home API to control specific devices (e.g., adjust volume, turn lights on/off) based on the recognized gesture.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display the recognized gesture and the corresponding action on the screen.
- **Error Handling:**  Implement basic error handling for cases where gesture recognition fails.

- **Advanced Features:**  Calibration for individual user hand sizes.
- **Optional Feature:** Add a simple GUI for selecting controlled devices and defining custom gestures.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, pyautogui, and the smart home API library).
2. **Gesture Capture & Recognition:** Implement the core logic using OpenCV and MediaPipe to capture the webcam feed and classify predefined gestures (e.g., thumb up/down, open hand).
3. **Smart Home Integration:**  Establish connection with your chosen smart home API and implement functions to control target devices based on recognized gestures.
4. **Real-time Feedback & Display:** Develop a simple display mechanism showing the recognized gesture and the action performed.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and hand positions to assess robustness and refine gesture recognition accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  MediaPipe's accuracy can vary based on lighting, hand position, and background clutter. Careful selection of gestures and robust error handling are crucial.
- **API Integration:**  Familiarity with the chosen smart home API's documentation and authentication processes is needed.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of real-time computer vision techniques using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Practical experience in integrating software with external hardware (webcam) and APIs (smart home).
