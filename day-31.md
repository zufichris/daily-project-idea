# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with Webcam

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time object tracking and classification system using a standard webcam.  The system will identify and track predefined objects within the webcam's field of view, providing bounding boxes and class labels.  This is a practical application of computer vision techniques, useful for various applications from robotics to security systems.  The daily challenge will focus on building a functional prototype capable of tracking a single, pre-defined object.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- TensorFlow/Keras (or similar deep learning framework – PyTorch could be used as an alternative)
- A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5) – downloading a suitable pre-trained model is crucial to staying within the daily timeframe.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system should detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball, a person) in the webcam feed.
- **Object Tracking:**  Once detected, the system should continuously track the object's movement, even if partially occluded.
- **Bounding Box Display:**  A bounding box should be displayed around the tracked object, showing its location in the frame.
- **Class Label Display:** The identified object's class label (e.g., "ball," "person") should be displayed near the bounding box.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Multiple object tracking;  more sophisticated tracking algorithms (e.g., DeepSORT).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras). Download a pre-trained object detection model compatible with the chosen framework.
2. **Webcam Access & Preprocessing:**  Write code to access the webcam feed using OpenCV.  Implement basic image preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing) if necessary for performance optimization.
3. **Object Detection & Classification:** Integrate the pre-trained model to perform object detection and classification on each frame.
4. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple object tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `Tracker` functions) to track the detected object across frames.
5. **Visualization & Display:** Overlay bounding boxes and class labels on the webcam feed and display FPS.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Performance Optimization:**  Achieving real-time performance (acceptable FPS) might require careful optimization of the code and selection of a lightweight object detection model.  Consider using a less resource-intensive model if performance is a bottleneck.
- **Object Occlusion:**  Handling situations where the object is partially or fully occluded can be challenging.  Exploring more robust tracking algorithms could be considered for a more advanced version.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of computer vision techniques for real-time object detection and tracking.
- Experience with using pre-trained models and integrating them into a larger application.
- Understanding of performance optimization techniques in computer vision applications.
