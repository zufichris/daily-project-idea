# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm.  The game will include a visual representation of the board and game state, allowing for easy understanding of the AI's decision-making process. This project focuses on implementing a classic AI algorithm in a visually appealing and interactive manner within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental AI concept in a practical, easily understandable context.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (optional, for board representation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Board:** A visually appealing 3x3 grid displayed using Pygame.
- **Player Input:**  Allows human player to make moves by clicking on the board.
- **Minimax AI:** Implements the Minimax algorithm to determine the AI's optimal moves.
- **Game Logic:**  Handles win/lose/draw conditions and appropriately ends the game.
- **Turn Indication:** Clearly indicates whose turn it is (human or AI).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Visual representation of the Minimax search tree (simplified for clarity).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Difficulty levels allowing the AI to explore a limited search depth.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create the game window using Pygame, draw the 3x3 grid, and handle player clicks to register moves.
2. **Game Logic:** Implement functions to check for win/lose/draw conditions and update the game state accordingly.
3. **Minimax Algorithm:** Implement the Minimax algorithm, ensuring correct evaluation of board states and recursive calls.
4. **AI Integration:** Integrate the Minimax AI to make moves after the human player.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  If time permits, add a simplified visual representation of the Minimax search tree, perhaps highlighting the nodes explored.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Optimization:**  The Minimax algorithm can be computationally expensive for larger game trees.  For Tic-Tac-Toe, this is manageable, but optimizations might be considered for scalability (e.g., alpha-beta pruning â€“ if time allows).
- **Pygame Integration:**  Efficiently integrating Pygame for real-time updates and visual feedback requires careful handling of game events and drawing calls.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of the Minimax algorithm:** This project provides practical experience implementing and visualizing a core AI search algorithm.
- **Improve skills in game development and user interface design:** Utilizing Pygame enhances skills in creating interactive applications with visual elements.
