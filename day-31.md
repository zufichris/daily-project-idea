# Robotic Arm Calibration via Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple, yet effective calibration system for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to develop a program that can automatically identify and locate calibration targets (e.g., colored markers) in the arm's workspace and adjust the arm's internal coordinate system accordingly. This is a crucial step in ensuring accurate robotic arm movements, especially in applications requiring precise positioning.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, a robotics library (e.g., ROS, PySerial for serial communication depending on the arm's interface).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, low-cost one will suffice), a webcam or camera, and potentially a marker set for calibration.

## Features & Requirements

- **Target Detection:** The system must reliably detect and locate pre-defined calibration targets (e.g., colored circles or squares) within the camera's field of view.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Calculate the 3D coordinates of the targets in the camera's coordinate system and transform them to the robot's coordinate system.
- **Inverse Kinematics:** Utilize the calculated coordinates to command the robotic arm to move to the corresponding locations.  (Simplified IK solutions can be used for a day-long challenge).
- **Calibration Adjustment:** Implement a mechanism to adjust the robot's internal parameters based on the discrepancies between the commanded and actual positions.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the detected targets, their calculated coordinates, and the robot's movements in a visual interface.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more robust error correction algorithm, potentially using iterative least squares.
- **Optional Feature:**  Include a user interface for selecting and adjusting calibration parameters.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Target Detection & Coordinate Calculation:** Use OpenCV to detect the calibration targets in the camera images. Calculate their 2D pixel coordinates and then, using camera calibration parameters (intrinsic matrix, distortion coefficients), convert them to 3D world coordinates.
2. **Coordinate Transformation:** Establish a transformation matrix between the camera and robot coordinate systems. This might involve manual measurements or a more sophisticated approach if time allows. Apply this transformation to the calculated target coordinates.
3. **Inverse Kinematics (Simplified):**  For a simplified approach, use a pre-calculated lookup table or a very basic IK algorithm to control the robot arm's joints based on the transformed coordinates.  Focus on a single degree of freedom for initial testing.
4. **Calibration Adjustment:** Compare the actual robot end-effector position (obtained through sensors or visual feedback) with the desired position.  A simple adjustment can involve adding offsets to the robot's joint angles.
5. **Visual Feedback:** Display the images with target locations highlighted, calculated coordinates, and robot arm movements on a GUI (e.g., using Matplotlib).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Camera Calibration:** Obtaining accurate camera parameters is crucial.  Pre-calibrated cameras or simplifying assumptions (e.g., assuming a pinhole camera model) can help reduce the complexity.
- **Accuracy of Inverse Kinematics:**  Simplified IK solutions might lead to some inaccuracies, especially for complex robot arms. Focus on a simpler arm setup for easier implementation.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision:**  Gain hands-on experience with object detection, image processing, and coordinate transformations using OpenCV.
- **Robotics Control:**  Learn about basic robotic arm control, coordinate systems, and calibration techniques.  This provides a basic understanding of the intricate relationship between perception and action in robotics.
