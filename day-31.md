# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will process camera input, identify pre-defined gestures, and translate them into commands for the appliance. This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and IoT integration, achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  requests (HTTP communication for appliance control).
* **Hardware:** Webcam,  (optional) Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer for a more embedded solution.  A smart home appliance with an API for remote control.
* **Software:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately recognize at least three distinct gestures (e.g., hand wave for on/off, open hand for brightness increase, closed fist for brightness decrease).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Gestures should be processed and acted upon with minimal latency.
- **Appliance Control:**  The system must successfully send commands to a chosen smart home appliance via its API or network protocol.
- **User Interface:** A simple visual display (e.g., console output) showing recognized gestures and sent commands.

- **Advanced Features:**  Calibration functionality to adjust gesture sensitivity based on user.
- **Optional Feature:**  Integration with a voice assistant for enhanced control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, requests) and configure the development environment.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement the gesture recognition pipeline using MediaPipe, focusing on hand tracking and gesture classification.
3. **Appliance Integration:**  Develop the code to communicate with the target smart appliance via its API, translating recognized gestures into appropriate commands (e.g., ON/OFF, brightness level).
4. **User Interface Development:** Create a basic visual display showing the recognized gestures and appliance status.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly, adjusting parameters and refining gesture recognition accuracy as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variability in lighting conditions can affect the accuracy of gesture recognition. This can be mitigated by using robust image processing techniques or adding more sophisticated lighting compensation.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Distinguishing between similar gestures might require careful training data selection and algorithm optimization.  Pre-processing steps to enhance image quality and careful feature extraction can help here.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Techniques:**  This project will reinforce skills in real-time image processing, object detection, and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **IoT Integration:**  It provides hands-on experience in integrating a computer vision system with a smart home device via its API, showcasing practical application of IoT principles.
