# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, self-calibrating system for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to enable the robot arm to accurately locate and grasp objects without relying on pre-programmed positions. This is significant because it allows for more adaptable and flexible robotic applications, especially in unstructured environments. The focus will be on a minimal viable prototype focusing on a single degree of freedom (DOF) for simplicity and time constraints.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), NumPy (for numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., PySerial if using an Arduino-controlled arm).
* **Hardware:** A single-DOF robotic arm (e.g., a servo motor on a rotatory base), a webcam or camera, a calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard pattern).

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:** The system should calibrate the camera to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
- **Object Detection:** The system should detect the calibration target in the camera's field of view.
- **Pose Estimation:**  The system should estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the target relative to the camera.
- **Arm Control:** The system should translate the pose information into commands to move the robotic arm to a specified position relative to the object.
- **Error Minimization:** The system will attempt to minimize error through iterative adjustments.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple feedback loop to refine arm position based on real-time camera feedback.
- **Optional Feature:** Extend to multiple DOFs for a more complex arm.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration & Target Detection:** Use OpenCV to calibrate the camera and detect the checkerboard target.  Save calibration parameters.
2. **Pose Estimation:**  Utilize the calibration parameters and OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to estimate the target's pose.
3. **Arm Control Mapping:**  Establish a mapping between the target's estimated pose and the required robotic arm movements.  This will likely involve simple trigonometry for the single DOF case.
4. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate the camera vision system with the robotic arm control system. Test the accuracy of the arm's movements in grasping the target.
5. **Refinement (Optional):**  If time permits, implement a feedback loop to iteratively refine the arm's positioning based on the camera's continuous observation of the target.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:**  Achieving high accuracy in pose estimation and arm movement will be challenging due to potential camera noise and mechanical inaccuracies in the arm.  This can be partly mitigated by using a high-resolution camera and a well-maintained robotic arm.
- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing might be computationally expensive.  Optimization techniques, such as reducing image resolution or using more efficient algorithms, might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Reinforce understanding of camera calibration, object detection, and pose estimation techniques.
- **Robotic Control Basics:**  Gain practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic control systems, highlighting the importance of calibration and feedback loops in achieving accurate movements.
