# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection controlled by an intelligent traffic light system. The simulation will prioritize minimizing wait times and optimizing traffic flow based on real-time vehicle detection. This is a valuable exercise in algorithmic design, data structures, and visualization within a constrained time frame.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Tools:** A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Randomly generate vehicles at various entry points to the intersection with variable speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light algorithm (e.g., fixed timing or a simple rule-based system) to control the signals.
- **Vehicle Detection & Tracking:** Simulate vehicle detection using simple bounding boxes around vehicle sprites in Pygame.
- **Visualization:**  Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light states graphically using Pygame.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Track metrics such as average wait time and throughput.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated traffic light control algorithm (e.g., adaptive control based on vehicle density).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add different vehicle types (cars, trucks) with varying speeds and sizes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Initialization:** Set up the Pygame window, define the intersection layout, and initialize vehicle generation parameters.
2. **Vehicle Generation and Movement:** Implement vehicle generation and movement logic, considering boundaries and collisions.
3. **Basic Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light switching mechanism (e.g., fixed timing).
4. **Vehicle Detection:** Add simple bounding boxes around vehicles for basic detection;  count vehicles at each entry point.
5. **Visualization & Metrics:** Update the display with the current state, vehicles, traffic lights, and relevant metrics.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Collision Detection:**  Implementing robust collision detection within the limited timeframe could be challenging.  Start with simplified bounding boxes and refine if time permits.
- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Choosing a sophisticated traffic control algorithm might be too complex for a 1-2 day timeframe. Focus on a simpler approach and improve it iteratively.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithmic Design:** Practice designing and implementing algorithms for traffic control and vehicle movement.
- **Data Structures & Visualization:**  Reinforce skills in using data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) to represent the simulation and visualize data effectively using Pygame.
