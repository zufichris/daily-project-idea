#  Miniature Robot Obstacle Avoidance with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple robot simulation that utilizes reinforcement learning to navigate a maze-like environment, avoiding obstacles. The goal is to demonstrate a functional prototype of obstacle avoidance using a readily available reinforcement learning library within a short timeframe.  This project focuses on the core learning algorithm and simplifies the robotic aspects for quicker iteration.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for visualization)
- Stable Baselines3 (or similar RL library like TensorFlow Agents)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Obstacle Detection:** The robot should detect obstacles within its simulated environment.
- **Movement Control:** The robot should be able to move forward, backward, and turn left/right.
- **Reward System:** A reward mechanism should incentivize the robot to reach a target location while avoiding obstacles.
- **Learning and Adaptation:** The robot should learn to navigate the maze through trial and error using reinforcement learning.
- **Visualization:**  The process should be visualized using Pygame, showing the robot's movement and obstacle avoidance in real-time.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate a more complex environment with varying obstacle types and shapes. Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple maze environment using Pygame. Define the robot's position, movement mechanics, and obstacle locations.  Implement a reward function that provides positive rewards for reaching the target and negative rewards for collisions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm from Stable Baselines3 (e.g., PPO or A2C). Define the agent's action space (movement commands) and observation space (sensor readings).
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that repeatedly runs the environment, allowing the agent to interact with it, receive rewards, and update its policy based on the chosen RL algorithm.
4. **Visualization:** Integrate Pygame to visualize the robot's movement, the maze, and the obstacles. Display the training progress (e.g., reward curves).
5. **Testing:** After sufficient training, test the agent's ability to navigate the maze without prior knowledge of the obstacle layout.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that balances exploration and exploitation is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior or slow learning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** RL algorithms often require careful tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.). Finding the optimal settings may require experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning concepts: Understanding the core principles of reinforcement learning, including agents, environments, rewards, and policy updates.
- Practical application of RL libraries: Gaining experience in using a reinforcement learning library like Stable Baselines3 for solving a real-world problem.
