# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Specific Object Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet functional AI-powered image caption generator that focuses on accurately describing a specific object within an image.  Instead of generating general captions, the system will prioritize detailed descriptions of a pre-defined target object (e.g., a particular type of flower, a specific car model).  This differs from general image captioning by focusing on precision and detailed feature extraction relevant to a single object.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NLTK (or similar NLP library)
* **Pre-trained Models:** A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) and a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., Show, Attend and Tell architecture).  Fine-tuning might be needed depending on the target object's specificity.
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (or similar IDE), suitable image dataset.

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Accurately locate and identify the target object within an input image using a pre-trained object detection model.
* **Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction:** Extract the region of the image containing the detected object.
* **Caption Generation:** Generate a descriptive caption for the extracted ROI using a pre-trained image captioning model.
* **Output Display:** Display the original image with a bounding box around the detected object and the generated caption overlaid on the image.
* **User Input:** Allow the user to specify the target object category (e.g., "red rose," "Toyota Camry").

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Model Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune the pre-trained models using a curated dataset specific to the target object for improved accuracy.
- **Multiple Object Detection & Captioning:** Extend the functionality to handle multiple instances of the target object within a single image.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation:** Gather or create a small dataset of images featuring the target object, ensuring diverse angles and lighting conditions.  Annotate the images with bounding boxes.
2. **Model Selection and Loading:** Choose and load pre-trained object detection and image captioning models.  Explore available models on TensorFlow Hub or similar repositories.
3. **Integration:** Integrate the object detection and captioning models.  The object detector provides the ROI, which serves as input to the caption generator.
4. **User Interface (UI):** Create a simple UI (using a library like Tkinter or a Jupyter Notebook cell) to handle user input (target object) and display the results.
5. **Testing & Evaluation:** Test the system with various images and evaluate the accuracy of both object detection and caption generation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the caption heavily relies on the pre-trained models' performance and the quality of the dataset. Fine-tuning might be necessary for optimal results within the short timeframe.
- **Computational Resources:**  Running the models may require a reasonable amount of computational power.  Consider using cloud computing resources if needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of pre-trained model usage and integration:** This project strengthens skills in leveraging existing models for specific tasks and integrating them seamlessly.
- **Practical experience in object detection and image captioning pipelines:** Hands-on experience building and deploying an end-to-end AI pipeline from image input to textual output will provide valuable insights.
