# Robotic Arm Calibration with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, self-calibrating robotic arm control system using machine learning.  The system will leverage a small dataset of known positions and corresponding motor angles to train a model capable of predicting accurate motor angles for desired end-effector positions. This eliminates the need for complex manual calibration processes, improving efficiency and reducing setup time. The focus will be on a single degree of freedom for simplicity and daily scope.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning), NumPy (for numerical computation), PySerial (for serial communication with the robotic arm, if applicable)
- **Hardware:** A single-degree-of-freedom robotic arm (e.g., a simple servo motor with a position sensor), or a simulated environment.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook/IDE for Python development

## Features & Requirements

- **Data Acquisition:** Collect a dataset of arm positions and corresponding servo angles.
- **Model Training:** Train a simple regression model (e.g., linear regression, neural network) to map desired positions to servo angles.
- **Position Control:** Implement a control loop that uses the trained model to control the servo motor to achieve desired positions.
- **Error Correction:** Implement basic error handling and correction based on sensor feedback (if applicable).
- **Visualization:** Plot the training data and model predictions.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated model (e.g., a Recurrent Neural Network) to account for dynamic effects.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integrate a GUI for easy interaction and parameter adjustment.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Manually move the robotic arm to several known positions and record the corresponding servo angles. Store this data in a CSV file.
2. **Model Training:** Load the data, preprocess it (if necessary), and train a simple regression model using TensorFlow/Keras. Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
3. **Control Implementation:** Write a control loop that takes a desired position as input, uses the trained model to predict the required servo angle, and sends this command to the servo motor (or simulate this in a software environment).
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various desired positions and observe its performance. Refine the model or control loop based on the results.
5. **Visualization:** Generate plots to visualize the collected data, the trained model's predictions, and the system's performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:** Inaccurate or noisy data can significantly impact model performance. Careful data collection and preprocessing are crucial.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate model architecture and hyperparameters can be challenging and may require experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of regression model training and application in a real-world context.
- Hands-on experience with integrating machine learning algorithms with robotic systems.
