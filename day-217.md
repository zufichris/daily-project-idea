# Real-time Object Recognition & Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet functional real-time object recognition and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will identify a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view and track its movement, displaying the object's location on a screen. This project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision and embedded systems.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (4 recommended), USB Camera
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for model inference - optional, can use a simpler approach initially)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Identify and locate the target object (e.g., a red ball) in each frame from the camera.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the object's movement across consecutive frames, displaying its coordinates (x,y) on the screen.
- **Visual Feedback:** Overlay bounding boxes or other visual indicators on the camera feed to highlight the tracked object.
- **Frame Rate Display:** Show the frames per second (FPS) achieved for performance evaluation.
- **Basic User Interface:** A simple display showing the object's coordinates and FPS.

- **Advanced Features:** (Optional) Implement a more sophisticated object tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) for smoother tracking. Integrate a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for broader object recognition capabilities.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi and install the necessary libraries (`pip3 install opencv-python`).
2. **Object Detection:** Implement basic color thresholding (HSV) to detect the target object.  If using TensorFlow Lite, load and run the pre-trained model.
3. **Object Tracking:** Employ a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Visual Feedback:**  Overlay bounding boxes and display the object's coordinates and FPS on the camera feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **GUI (Optional):** Create a simple GUI (e.g., using Tkinter or a simpler method) to display the data more cleanly.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi might struggle with high-resolution video and complex algorithms. Optimization (reducing image size, simpler algorithms) will be crucial.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Varying lighting conditions can significantly affect the accuracy of color-based object detection.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with real-time image processing using OpenCV.
- Reinforcement of object detection and tracking algorithms.  Understanding of the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and computational resources.
