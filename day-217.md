#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration & Control

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simplified control system for a miniature robotic arm (e.g., a commercially available kit or a 3D-printed model with pre-assembled servos).  The goal is to implement a basic calibration routine and a simple control interface allowing for precise positional control of the arm's end effector. This challenges the developer to integrate hardware control with software algorithms in a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `RPi.GPIO` (if using Raspberry Pi), `PySerial` (for serial communication), `NumPy` (for numerical computation), potentially a Robotics library like `PyBullet` for simulation (optional).
* **Hardware:** Miniature robotic arm kit (e.g., a 4-DOF arm with servo motors),  a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino), power supply, connecting wires.
* **Tools:**  Text editor/IDE (VS Code, Thonny), Serial monitor.

## Features & Requirements

- **Servo Motor Control:**  Precisely control the position of each servo motor using PWM signals.
- **Calibration Routine:**  Implement a procedure to calibrate the zero position and range of motion for each servo.
- **Basic Control Interface:** Create a simple interface (CLI or GUI) to manually set the desired angles for each joint.
- **End Effector Positioning:**  Calculate and send commands to the servos to move the end effector to a specified (x,y,z) coordinate (simplified 2D may suffice for a dayâ€™s work).
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record servo angles and end effector positions for analysis.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the robotic arm to the microcontroller and power supply.  Verify power and communication.
2. **Servo Calibration:**  Develop a calibration script to determine the minimum and maximum PWM values for each servo to achieve full range of motion.
3. **Control Interface Development:** Create a simple interface (CLI preferred for rapid prototyping) that accepts user input (joint angles or target coordinates).
4. **Inverse Kinematics (Simplified):** Implement a simplified algorithm (e.g., for a 2D planar arm) to translate desired (x,y) coordinates into individual servo angles.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the control system and refine calibration parameters for accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Servo Calibration Precision:** Achieving accurate calibration requires careful adjustment and potentially iterative refinement.
- **Inverse Kinematics Complexity:**  Implementing a full inverse kinematics solution can be time-consuming; simplifying to a 2D planar arm reduces complexity, but can be a limitation.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Integration:** This project strengthens skills in interfacing software with hardware components.
- **Robotic Control Algorithms:** This project provides hands-on experience with basic robotic control concepts like calibration and (potentially) inverse kinematics.
