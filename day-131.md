# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, playable game (e.g., a simplified version of Pong or Snake) and develop a basic AI opponent using reinforcement learning. The focus is on a quick implementation and demonstration of RL principles rather than a highly sophisticated AI.  The significance lies in understanding and applying RL concepts in a practical setting within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch) for reinforcement learning.
* **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Functional Game:**  A playable game with basic controls and a scoring system.
- **RL Agent:** An AI opponent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the AI agent through interactions with the game environment.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display of the game state and agent's performance (score, actions).
- **Basic Game Logic:**  Simple game rules and collision detection.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a simple neural network architecture for the agent.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Incorporate a replay buffer for improved training stability.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create the basic game framework using Pygame, including game visuals, controls, and scoring.  Focus on simplicity.
2. **Environment Definition:** Design the game environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the RL agent, defining states, actions, rewards, and transitions.
3. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement it to interact with the game environment.
4. **Training and Evaluation:** Run the training loop, allowing the agent to learn through repeated gameplay. Evaluate its performance against a random agent or a human player.
5. **Visualization and Refinement:**  Visualize the agent's learning process and improve its performance by tuning hyperparameters or modifying the reward function.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Selection:**  Choosing an appropriate RL algorithm and managing its complexity within the time constraint.  A simpler algorithm like Q-learning is recommended.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can be time-consuming.  Start with reasonable defaults and adjust iteratively.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience in applying RL algorithms to a simple game environment.
- **Game Development:** Refine skills in game development using Pygame or a similar library.
