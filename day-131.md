# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, self-balancing robotic arm using a single servo motor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The arm will maintain a stable upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating fundamental control system principles. This is a scaled-down, simplified version to fit within a daily challenge timeframe.  The significance lies in its practical application of PID control, a crucial concept in robotics and automation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework/Library:**  Pygame (for visualization, optional),  a suitable IMU library (e.g., MPU6050 library for I2C communication), a servo motor library (e.g., RPi.GPIO for Raspberry Pi).
* **Hardware:** A small servo motor, an MPU6050 IMU, a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico or Arduino Nano), breadboard, jumper wires, power supply.

## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position against minor disturbances.
- **Angle Measurement:** The IMU should accurately measure the arm's tilt angle.
- **Servo Control:** The servo motor should receive precise control signals to adjust the arm's position based on the IMU data.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A PID controller should be implemented to provide robust and stable balancing.
- **Basic Visualization (Optional):**  A simple graphical representation of the arm's angle and control signals using Pygame.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU and servo motor to the microcontroller. Calibrate the IMU and servo motor ranges.
2. **IMU Data Acquisition:** Write code to read the IMU's accelerometer and gyroscope data to calculate the tilt angle. Implement a complementary filter or Kalman filter for noise reduction (if time allows).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller to adjust the servo motor's position based on the calculated error (difference between desired and current angle). Tune the PID gains (K_p, K_i, K_d) experimentally.
4. **Control Loop:** Integrate the IMU data acquisition and PID controller into a continuous control loop.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system's stability under various disturbances. Adjust the PID gains for optimal performance.  If using visualization, implement the optional Pygame display.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Gain Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains requires iterative experimentation.  Poorly tuned gains can lead to oscillations or instability.
- **IMU Noise:** IMU data is often noisy. Implementing filtering techniques is crucial for accurate angle estimation.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:**  This project provides hands-on experience in designing and implementing a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Sensor Integration and Data Processing:** Gain practical experience in integrating sensor data (IMU) and processing it to control a robotic actuator (servo motor).
