# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with IMU Feedback

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a miniature self-balancing robotic arm using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for feedback. The goal is to design a system where the arm maintains its upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating a fundamental control system concept in a tangible robotic application. This project is scalable, with the complexity adjustable based on the time available.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries listed below)
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 IoT (or similar with IMU support)
- **IMU:** MPU6050 (or similar 6-axis IMU)
- **Servomotors:** At least two hobby servos (one for base rotation, one for arm elevation)
- **Libraries:**  `PySerial` (for Arduino communication), `numpy`, `matplotlib` (for data visualization and analysis - optional).

## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position using IMU feedback.
- **Basic Motor Control:**  Individual servo control should allow for precise positioning of the arm.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller should regulate the arm's position.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record IMU data and servo commands for analysis.
- **User Interface (Optional):** A basic GUI (using a library like Tkinter) to manually adjust PID gains or observe sensor data.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU and servos to the Arduino.  Calibrate the IMU and servos. Ensure power supply stability.
2. **IMU Data Acquisition:** Write Arduino code to read IMU data (acceleration and angular velocity) and transmit it to the computer via serial communication.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Develop a Python script to receive IMU data, implement the PID algorithm, calculate control signals for the servos, and send these signals back to the Arduino.
4. **Servo Control:**  Implement the servo control logic in the Arduino code based on the control signals from the Python script.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the system's stability.  Fine-tune the PID gains to optimize performance and stability against disturbances (e.g., gentle pushes).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains requires iterative adjustments and might consume significant time if aiming for robust performance. Start with conservative gains and gradually increase them.
- **Noise Filtering:** IMU data often contains noise. Implementing a simple moving average filter or complementary filter can significantly improve the system's stability.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of PID control:** This project provides hands-on experience implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Practical experience with embedded systems and sensor integration:**  Combining the Arduino microcontroller, IMU, and Python for data processing provides practical experience in sensor integration and embedded systems programming.
