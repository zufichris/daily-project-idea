# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated two-wheeled self-balancing robot.  The goal is to create a stable control system that keeps the robot upright despite disturbances. This provides a practical application of a crucial control algorithm in robotics and control systems engineering.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for simulation visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements

- **Robot Simulation:** Create a simplified 2D simulation of a self-balancing robot using Pygame.
- **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a PID controller to adjust motor speeds based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
- **Sensor Simulation:** Simulate an inclinometer (measuring angle) and rate gyroscope (measuring angular velocity).
- **Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain its upright position despite simulated disturbances (e.g., a sudden push).
- **Visualization:** The simulation should visually represent the robot's state (angle, velocity) and control actions.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a Kalman filter to improve sensor data fusion and noise reduction.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add a user interface (e.g., using Pygame's GUI features) to adjust PID gains in real-time.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Robot Simulation:**  Create a basic Pygame window and represent the robot as a simple shape (e.g., a rectangle).  Implement basic physics (gravity, angular momentum).
2. **Sensor Simulation:** Implement functions to simulate inclinometer and gyroscope readings, adding a degree of simulated noise.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design the PID controller with adjustable gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).  The controller output should determine motor speeds.
4. **Control Loop:** Integrate the controller into the simulation's main loop.  Update the robot's state based on the controller output and simulated physics.
5. **Visualization & Tuning:** Observe the robot's behavior and tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve stable balancing.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments.  Consider using a systematic approach like Ziegler-Nichols method.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** Balancing a real robot is more complex due to unmodeled dynamics and friction. The simulation should strike a balance between simplicity and realism.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental algorithm in control systems.
- **Robot Simulation:** Develop skills in creating and working with a simplified robotic simulation, improving understanding of robot dynamics and control.
