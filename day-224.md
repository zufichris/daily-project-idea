# Automated Code Style Checker with Customizable Rules

## Overview
This project aims to develop a command-line tool that automatically checks the coding style of a given Python file against a user-defined set of rules. This enhances code consistency, readability, and maintainability.  The tool will focus on a subset of style rules for a manageable daily scope.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) library
- `argparse` library (for command-line arguments)
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Terminal/Command prompt

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Parses a Python file using the `ast` module.
    - Checks for specific style violations (e.g., line length exceeding 79 characters, inconsistent indentation, missing docstrings for functions).
    - Reports violations with line numbers and descriptions.
    - Accepts a Python file path as a command-line argument.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Customizable rule set via a configuration file (JSON or YAML).
    - Support for multiple Python versions.
- **Requirement:** The tool must be able to handle basic Python syntax correctly.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Rule Definition:** Define a list of coding style rules (e.g., maximum line length, indentation style).  Start with 2-3 basic rules to keep it manageable for a daily challenge.
2. **AST Parsing:** Use the `ast` module to parse the input Python file and traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree.
3. **Rule Enforcement:** Implement functions that check each node of the AST against the defined rules.  Store violations in a list.
4. **Reporting:** Generate a report listing the violations, including file name, line numbers, and descriptions.
5. **Command-line Interface:** Use `argparse` to create a command-line interface for the tool, allowing users to specify the input file path.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Handling Complex AST Structures:**  The `ast` module can generate complex tree structures. Efficient traversal and rule application requires careful planning.  Focus on a simplified subset of AST nodes for the daily scope.
- **Error Handling:** The tool should gracefully handle invalid input files or unexpected errors during parsing or rule enforcement. Implement robust error handling mechanisms.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of Python's `ast` module for static code analysis.
- Practice building command-line tools using Python and `argparse`.  This includes argument parsing and handling, output formatting and efficient error reporting.
