# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be a custom-designed, text-based environment, minimizing the setup time and allowing for rapid iteration and experimentation with different reinforcement learning algorithms.  This project demonstrates practical applications of RL in a controlled setting and highlights core concepts of AI.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Stable Baselines3 (or similar RL library)
- NumPy
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:** A simple text-based game with a clear reward system (e.g., a grid-based navigation game where the agent needs to reach a goal).
- **Agent Training:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)) to train the agent.
- **Agent Performance Evaluation:**  Measure the agent's performance using metrics like average reward per episode and the number of steps to reach the goal.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Basic visualization of the agent's actions and progress within the game environment.
- **Data Logging:** Log key metrics during training for analysis.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Design the Game Environment:** Define the rules, state representation, actions, and reward structure of the simple game using Gym or a custom environment.
2. **Choose and Implement the RL Algorithm:** Select a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., PPO from Stable Baselines3) and integrate it with the game environment.
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the training process, monitoring performance metrics. Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the agent's learning.
4. **Evaluate Performance:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance against several test runs and analyze the collected data.
5. **Optional Visualization:** If time permits, create a basic visualization to show the agent's progress.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require experimentation and iterative adjustments. This can be addressed by starting with default settings and systematically modifying them based on performance.
- **Reward Shaping:**  Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for effective learning. A poorly designed reward function could lead to the agent learning suboptimal strategies.  Start with a simple reward and refine it based on the agent's behavior.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, PPO).
- Practical experience designing and implementing a simple game environment for AI agents.
