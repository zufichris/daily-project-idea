# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple system that uses a camera to detect and track a specific object in real-time, then commands a robotic arm (simulated or physical) to follow its movement.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and integration, rather than sophisticated computer vision algorithms.  This is significant as it demonstrates fundamental concepts in robotics and computer vision in a tangible way.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, a robotic arm simulator library (e.g., PyBullet, V-REP) or direct interface to a physical robotic arm (ROS, specific manufacturer libraries).
- **Tools:**  A webcam or video feed, a robotic arm (physical or simulated).


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using color thresholding.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across frames.
- **Arm Control:**  Command a simulated or physical robotic arm to move its end-effector to the tracked object's coordinates.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for object loss or out-of-reach situations.
- **User Interface:** A simple GUI (optional) to display the camera feed, object location, and arm control parameters.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more robust object detection algorithm (e.g., using Haar cascades or a pre-trained deep learning model).
- **Optional Feature:**  Add a mechanism for the robotic arm to grasp and manipulate the detected object.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Object Detection:** Set up the camera feed and implement basic color thresholding to detect the object.  Create a bounding box around the detected object.
2. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the object's movement across frames.
3. **Arm Control Interface:** Establish communication with the robotic arm simulator or physical arm.  Map the object's tracked coordinates to arm joint angles or cartesian coordinates.
4. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the object tracking and arm control modules. Test the system with various object movements and distances.
5. **Refinement and Error Handling:** Refine the object detection and tracking, and add basic error handling (e.g., if the object disappears from the view).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Speed:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms and potentially optimization techniques to maintain a high frame rate.
- **Calibration:**  If using a physical robotic arm, accurate calibration is crucial for correct positioning.  Simulators often require less calibration, but may not fully represent real-world complexities.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces practical experience in real-time image processing with OpenCV.
- It provides hands-on experience in robotic arm control, either via simulation or physical interaction, including coordinate transformations and error handling.
