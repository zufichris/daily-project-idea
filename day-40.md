# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, game and implement a basic AI opponent using reinforcement learning (RL).  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating a fundamental RL concept within a limited timeframe. The game will be text-based for simplicity, allowing the focus to remain on the AI implementation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow)
- A suitable game library (e.g., Pygame for a visual upgrade, but not strictly required for the core challenge)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Game Mechanics:** A simple turn-based game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Nim) with clearly defined win/loss/draw conditions.
- **AI Opponent:** An AI player that learns to play the game using a basic RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
- **Training Loop:** A function to train the AI against itself or a random opponent.
- **Game Simulation:** A function to simulate games between the AI and either a random opponent or a human player.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  A way to measure the AI's performance (e.g., win rate).

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network) if time permits.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Add a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame or a similar library.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Design & Implementation:** Define the game rules and implement the core game logic in Python.  Keep it extremely simple (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe).
2. **RL Algorithm Selection & Implementation:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for its ease of implementation) and implement it.
3. **Training & Evaluation:**  Create a training loop where the AI plays against itself or a random opponent.  Implement a method to evaluate its performance (win rate).
4. **Game Simulation:** Implement a function to simulate games with the trained AI and either another AI or a human player.
5. **Refinement and Testing:** Test the AIâ€™s performance and adjust parameters as needed.  If time allows, explore the optional advanced features.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:** Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions is crucial in RL.  Experimenting with different exploration strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy) may be necessary.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The performance of RL algorithms is highly sensitive to hyperparameters.  Experimentation and possibly some automated hyperparameter tuning would be beneficial if time permits.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., Q-learning, states, actions, rewards).
- Practical experience implementing and applying RL algorithms in a simple game environment.
