# Mini-Max Search for a Simplified Game AI

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a Mini-Max search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for a simplified version of a two-player game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.  The goal is to create a functional AI opponent that can play at a reasonable level of competency within a short timeframe. This demonstrates fundamental AI concepts in a practical context.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `numpy` (optional, for efficient board representation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Game board representation (2D array or list).
    - Mini-Max search algorithm implementation.
    - Alpha-beta pruning for improved efficiency.
    - Game logic (win/lose/draw conditions).
    - User interface (text-based is sufficient).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Heuristic function for more strategic game play (beyond simple win/loss evaluation).
    - Graphical user interface (using a library like Pygame).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Define the game board, rules, and win/lose conditions in Python. Create functions for checking game state and making moves.
2. **Mini-Max Implementation:** Implement the core Mini-Max algorithm recursively.  This function will explore all possible game states to a certain depth.
3. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Integrate alpha-beta pruning to significantly improve the search efficiency of the Mini-Max algorithm.
4. **User Interface:**  Create a simple text-based interface to allow the user to play against the AI.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Play several games against the AI to test its performance and identify areas for improvement (heuristic function tuning, etc.).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Complexity:**  The Mini-Max algorithm can be computationally expensive for larger game boards or search depths.  Alpha-beta pruning mitigates this but careful consideration of search depth is crucial for a daily project.
- **Heuristic Function Design (Optional):**  If attempting the optional heuristic function, designing a good heuristic that accurately reflects the game state's value requires careful thought and potentially experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces understanding of search algorithms (Mini-Max) and optimization techniques (alpha-beta pruning).
- Provides practical experience in implementing AI algorithms in a tangible game context.
