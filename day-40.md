# Smart Home Device Automation with Rule-Based Engine

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary rule-based automation engine for a smart home device, allowing users to define custom rules to trigger actions based on sensor data.  The focus is on creating a functional prototype that can handle simple automation scenarios within a short timeframe. This will demonstrate core concepts in event-driven programming and rule engine design, applicable to broader IoT applications.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework/Library:**  `RPi.GPIO` (if using a Raspberry Pi for sensor interaction), `json` (for rule storage), potentially a lightweight rule engine library like `durable-rules` (optional for advanced features).
- **Tools:**  A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text), a Raspberry Pi (optional, but highly recommended for a tangible output), various sensors (e.g., temperature, motion, light).

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:**  Ability to define rules in a simple JSON format (e.g., "IF temperature > 25Â°C THEN turn on fan").
- **Sensor Integration:** Read data from at least one sensor (e.g., temperature sensor).
- **Actuator Control:** Control a single actuator (e.g., turn a fan on/off).
- **Rule Execution Engine:**  Execute defined rules based on sensor readings.
- **Logging:** Basic logging of sensor data and rule executions.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Web UI for rule definition and monitoring; Support for multiple sensors and actuators.
- **Optional:** Integration with cloud services for remote monitoring and control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Sensor and Actuator Setup:** Connect chosen sensor(s) and actuator(s) (e.g., fan) to the Raspberry Pi (or suitable hardware) and verify functionality.  If no hardware is available, simulate sensor input with random data generation.
2. **Rule Engine Design:**  Design a simple rule engine using Python's `json` library to load rules, compare sensor data against rule conditions, and trigger actions.
3. **Rule Execution Loop:** Implement a loop that continuously reads sensor data, evaluates rules, and takes appropriate actions based on the defined rules.
4. **Logging Implementation:** Add basic logging to record sensor readings, rule evaluations, and actions performed.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system with various sensor inputs and rule configurations.  Refine the rule engine based on testing outcomes.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time constraints:**  Ensure the rule execution loop runs efficiently to prevent delays in responding to sensor changes.  Consider using asynchronous programming or threading if needed.
- **Error handling:** Implement robust error handling to deal with potential sensor failures or unexpected data.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Rule-based system design:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing a simple rule engine.
- **Event-driven programming:**  Practice working with sensor data as events and building a reactive system that responds to these events.
