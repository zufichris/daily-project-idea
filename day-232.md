# AI-Powered Smart Home Device Control via Voice

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic prototype of a smart home device controller using voice commands and a pre-trained speech-to-text model.  The goal is to demonstrate a simple but functional interface that translates voice commands into actions controlling a simulated smart home environment. This project highlights the integration of AI models with embedded systems or existing home automation APIs.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Speech-to-Text Library:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API or similar (e.g., AssemblyAI, Speechmatics).  A free tier should suffice for a basic prototype.
* **Framework (Optional):** Flask or FastAPI for a simple web API to handle the voice commands.
* **Simulated Smart Home:**  A dictionary or simple database to represent the state of simulated lights, appliances, etc.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Command Recognition:**  The system accurately recognizes and interprets basic voice commands such as "Turn on the living room lights," "Set the thermostat to 72 degrees," "Turn off the kitchen fan."
- **State Management:** The system maintains the current state of all simulated devices and updates it based on voice commands.
- **Error Handling:** The system gracefully handles unrecognized commands or invalid requests.
- **Text-to-Speech Feedback (Optional):**  Provides verbal confirmation of commands executed.
- **Command History (Optional):** Logs a history of executed voice commands.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Speech-to-Text API:** Obtain an API key and familiarize yourself with the library's usage.
2. **Create the Smart Home Simulator:** Develop a data structure (dictionary or simple database) to represent the state of lights, thermostat, etc.  Include functions to change their state.
3. **Develop the Command Interpreter:** Write a function that processes the transcribed speech, identifies the intended action (light control, thermostat adjustments, etc.), and updates the smart home simulator accordingly.
4. **Integrate with the Speech-to-Text API:**  Connect the command interpreter with the API to receive and process voice input.
5. **Test and Refine:** Test with various voice commands and iterate on the accuracy and robustness of the command interpretation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:**  Dealing with background noise or variations in pronunciation might affect the accuracy of the speech-to-text conversion. Consider error handling and potential fallbacks.
- **Ambiguous Commands:**  Designing the system to handle ambiguous or poorly phrased commands requires careful consideration of natural language understanding.  Limit the scope to highly specific, unambiguous commands initially.


## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience using speech-to-text APIs and integrating AI models into applications.
- Develop skills in designing robust, error-handling systems that process natural language inputs.
