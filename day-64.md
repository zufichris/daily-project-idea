# Self-Balancing Robot Control System (Simplified)

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified control system for a self-balancing robot using a single axis of rotation (e.g., a Segway-like robot).  The goal is to implement a basic Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain balance, demonstrable through simulated or physical robotics.  The project emphasizes practical application of control algorithms within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID control), Pygame (for simulation, optional) or a robotics library (e.g., ROS, if using physical hardware).
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino Uno/Nano, IMU (MPU6050), motor driver, small DC motors.

## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain an upright position when perturbed.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to adjust motor speeds based on sensor readings.
- **Sensor Data Acquisition (Simulation or Real):**  The system should acquire angle and angular velocity data (either from a simulated sensor or a physical IMU).
- **Motor Control (Simulation or Real):**  The system should send control signals to the motors (either simulated motors or physical DC motors).
- **User Interface (Optional):** A simple visual representation of the robot's state (angle, etc.) can enhance the user experience.

- **Advanced Features:**  Kalman Filter integration for noise reduction in sensor readings.
- **Advanced Features:** Implementation of a "setpoint" allowing the user to command a specific angle.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Sensor Data Acquisition:**  Implement the logic to read angle and angular velocity data either from a simulated sensor or a physical IMU.
2. **PID Controller Design:**  Tune the PID gains (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) to achieve stable balance. Start with a simple proportional controller and then progressively introduce integral and derivative terms.
3. **Motor Control Implementation:** Implement the logic to send appropriate commands to the motors based on the PID controller's output.
4. **Simulation/Hardware Integration:** Integrate the control system with either a Pygame simulation or a physical robot setup.
5. **Testing and Tuning:**  Test the system's ability to maintain balance under different perturbations and fine-tune the PID gains for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments.  Start with low gains and gradually increase them while monitoring for oscillations.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world IMU data contains noise, which can affect the controller's performance.  Techniques like Kalman filtering can mitigate this issue (advanced feature).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of PID control algorithms:** This project provides practical experience in designing and implementing a PID controller for a real-world application.
- **Develop proficiency in working with sensor data and actuators:**  The process involves handling sensor data, interpreting it, and using it to control actuators, a fundamental aspect of robotics and embedded systems.
