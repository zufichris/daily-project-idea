# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project involves building a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and implementing a rudimentary AI opponent using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus is on demonstrating a functional RL agent within a limited timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts without requiring extensive game development.  The game's simplicity allows for rapid prototyping and iteration of the RL algorithm. The significance lies in practically experiencing the core mechanics of RL in a tangible application.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Game Engine:** Pygame (for ease of rapid prototyping)
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (provides pre-built RL algorithms)
* **IDE:** Any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple 2D Game:** A basic game like Pong or a simplified version of Snake.
- **RL Agent:** An AI opponent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C).
- **Training Loop:**  A function to train the RL agent against a simple rule-based opponent or itself.
- **Game Visualization:**  Real-time rendering of the game within Pygame.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Basic metrics like average game score or win rate to monitor training progress.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., DQN) for comparison.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Introduce a more complex game environment with multiple AI opponents.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Design and implement the core game logic in Pygame.  This should involve creating the game window, game objects, and basic game rules.
2. **Environment Wrapper:** Create a wrapper around the Pygame game to interface with the RL library.  This wrapper should define the state space, action space, reward function, and step function for the RL agent.
3. **Agent Training:**  Use a pre-built RL algorithm from Stable Baselines3 (e.g., PPO) to train the AI agent.  Monitor training progress using the defined performance metrics.
4. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate the trained agent into the Pygame game and test its performance against a simple rule-based opponent or a human player.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** Based on the agent's performance, adjust hyperparameters of the RL algorithm or modify the game environment for better results.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining a suitable reward function that accurately reflects the desired agent behavior can be challenging.  Experimentation and iteration will be necessary.
- **Training Time:**  Finding a balance between training time and achieving reasonable performance requires careful consideration of the chosen RL algorithm and hyperparameters.  For a daily challenge, focus on a short training period and accept potentially suboptimal performance.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience in implementing and applying RL algorithms.
- **Game Development Basics:**  Improve skills in game development using Pygame, specifically integrating AI into a simple game.
