# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, up/down, hand open/close) and map them to specific smart home actions (e.g., changing channels, adjusting volume, turning lights on/off). This is a practical application of computer vision and machine learning, enabling intuitive and hands-free control.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras (optional for advanced feature)
- **Tools:**  Webcam, Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Capture:**  Real-time hand gesture detection from webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Classification of detected gestures into predefined actions (at least 4 distinct gestures).
- **Action Mapping:**  Translation of recognized gestures into commands for smart home devices (simulation or integration with a simple API).
- **User Interface:** Basic display showing the detected gesture and the corresponding action.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Tracking of accuracy and processing speed.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Customizable Gestures:**  Allow users to define their own gesture-action mappings.
- **Model Training (Advanced):** Train a custom TensorFlow/Keras model for higher accuracy and more complex gesture recognition.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, connect the webcam, and test the basic webcam feed using OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Develop a simple gesture classification logic (e.g., based on landmark distances or angles) or use a pre-trained model for quicker prototyping.
4. **Action Mapping & UI:**  Create a mapping between classified gestures and simulated smart home actions. Develop a simple UI to display the recognized gesture and the triggered action.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the classification logic or parameters for improved accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness to Noise:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand positions, and background clutter can be challenging.  Consider adding image pre-processing steps.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy with processing speed is crucial for a smooth user experience.  Optimize code and consider using hardware acceleration if needed.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Hands-on experience with Computer Vision:**  Practical application of MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Fundamentals of Machine Learning (if advanced feature is chosen):**  Exposure to model training, evaluation, and deployment (if using TensorFlow/Keras).
