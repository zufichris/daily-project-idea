# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with YOLOv8

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object tracking and classification system using the YOLOv8 model.  The goal is to demonstrate the speed and accuracy of YOLOv8 for a practical application, such as tracking moving objects in a video stream.  This system will be useful for various tasks like security surveillance, autonomous navigation, or robotic manipulation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Object Detection Model:** YOLOv8 (pre-trained model readily available)
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for video processing and display), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm), a GPU (highly recommended for speed)

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Accurately detect objects within a video stream using YOLOv8.
- **Object Tracking:** Track detected objects across frames, assigning unique IDs to each object.  Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using centroid tracking).
- **Classification:**  Display the classification label (e.g., "person," "car," "dog") for each detected object.
- **Visualization:** Display the video stream with bounding boxes and labels overlaid on detected objects.
- **FPS Monitoring:**  Display the frames per second (FPS) to measure the performance of the system.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated tracking algorithm (e.g., DeepSORT) for better handling of occlusions and object disappearances.  Add a simple user interface for selecting the video source.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, PyTorch, NumPy). Download a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
2. **Video Processing:** Load a video stream (from a file or webcam). Process each frame using OpenCV.
3. **Object Detection & Classification:**  Use the loaded YOLOv8 model to detect and classify objects in each frame.
4. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple centroid tracking algorithm to track objects across frames.
5. **Visualization & Output:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels on the video stream and display the FPS.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Processing video in real-time can be computationally expensive, especially with complex tracking algorithms. Utilizing a GPU is crucial for acceptable performance.  Consider downsampling the video resolution if necessary.
- **Accuracy:** The accuracy of object detection and tracking may vary depending on the quality of the video and the pre-trained model used. Experiment with different models or fine-tune a model if necessary (although outside the scope of a one or two day challenge).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Deep Learning Application:** Gain practical experience in applying a pre-trained deep learning model (YOLOv8) for a real-world problem.
- **Computer Vision Techniques:** Learn about object detection, classification, and tracking algorithms and their implementation using OpenCV and PyTorch.
