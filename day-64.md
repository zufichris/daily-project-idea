# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home device control system using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will allow users to control basic smart home functions (e.g., lights, temperature) through predefined gestures captured by a webcam.  This project focuses on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the feasibility of gesture control for IoT devices, highlighting potential improvements to accessibility and user experience.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking), RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi interaction, optional)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi, Webcam,  Smart Home Hub (e.g., Philips Hue bridge)
* **Software:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:**  The system should accurately detect and classify a small set of predefined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for lights on, closed fist for lights off, thumbs up for temperature increase).
- **Smart Home Integration (Optional):**  Control a simulated smart home environment or integrate with a real smart home hub (e.g., Philips Hue, IFTTT) to manipulate lighting or thermostat.
- **Gesture Visualization:** Display a visual representation of the recognized gesture on the screen.
- **Robustness to Noise:** The system should be reasonably tolerant to variations in lighting and hand positioning.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple, intuitive interface (perhaps just a console output initially).

**Advanced Features:**
- **Multiple User Support:**  Distinguish between different users based on hand geometry.
- **Customizable Gestures:** Allow users to define their own gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).
2. **Hand Tracking:** Implement real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe, capturing hand landmarks.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Develop a simple classification algorithm (e.g., based on hand landmark positions) to distinguish between predefined gestures.
4. **Action Triggering:**  Connect the gesture recognition to actions (e.g., printing commands to the console, sending commands to a simulated smart home environment or a real hub).
5. **Interface Development (Optional):** Create a basic graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with noisy data and ensuring accurate classification in real-time can be challenging.  Consider simplifying the gestures for initial prototyping.
- **Integration with Smart Home Systems:**  Setting up communication with a smart home hub and understanding its API can be time-consuming.  Simulating the smart home environment is a valid alternative for a one or two-day project.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce skills in real-time computer vision:**  Working with OpenCV and MediaPipe for image processing and hand tracking.
- **Develop skills in building a simple machine learning pipeline:**  Designing and implementing a gesture classification algorithm.
