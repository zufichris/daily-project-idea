# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robot Navigation

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI-powered image captioning system for a simulated robot.  The system will take an image from a simulated robot's camera, generate a descriptive caption, and use this caption for basic navigation decisions (e.g., "Turn left at the red wall"). This demonstrates a practical application of AI in robotics, focusing on efficient image processing and natural language processing for immediate task completion.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for image captioning model), NLTK or SpaCy (optional, for natural language processing refinement).
- **Tools:** A suitable simulated robotics environment (e.g., PyBullet, Gazebo â€“ a simpler environment is preferred for a 1-2 day project), Jupyter Notebook or IDE.

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition:** Capture an image from a simulated robot camera.
- **Caption Generation:**  Generate a concise caption describing the image content (e.g., "Hallway with door ahead").  A pre-trained model can be used for simplicity.
- **Action Selection:** Based on the caption, select a simple navigation action (e.g., "Move forward", "Turn left").  This can be a rule-based system based on keywords.
- **Simulated Robot Movement:** Execute the selected action in the simulated environment.
- **Output Display:** Display the original image, the generated caption, and the robot's action.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more sophisticated action selection based on semantic understanding of the caption (e.g., using a decision tree or a simple reinforcement learning approach).
- **Optional Feature:**  Integrate speech synthesis to verbally output the caption and action.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Set up the simulated environment and connect the robot's camera.  Load a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub).
2. **Image Processing:** Capture an image from the simulated camera, preprocess it (resize, normalize), and feed it to the captioning model.
3. **Caption Generation and Action Selection:** Generate the caption and, based on keywords or a simple rule set, decide on a navigation action.
4. **Robot Control:** Send the action command to the simulated robot.
5. **Output:** Display the image, caption, and robot's action.  Consider adding logging for debugging.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models might not perfectly capture all aspects of the simulated environment.  Addressing inaccuracies might require fine-tuning or creating a more tailored dataset.
- **Action Selection Complexity:** Designing robust rules or a simple AI for action selection can be challenging.  Start with a simple rule-based system and gradually increase complexity.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of AI concepts:** Applying pre-trained models and integrating AI into a robotics context.
- **Practical experience:** Building a functional system connecting image processing, natural language processing, and robotic control within a constrained time frame.
