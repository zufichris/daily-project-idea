# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures performed in front of the camera and trigger corresponding actions within a simulated smart home environment. This allows for exploration of computer vision and real-time gesture processing in a compact, easily demonstrable project.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, potentially TensorFlow Lite (for model optimization, optional)
- **Tools:**  Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Gesture Capture:** Capture and process webcam feed in real-time.
- **Micro-Gesture Recognition:** Recognize pre-defined micro-gestures (e.g., hand waving for lights, pinching for volume control).
- **Smart Home Simulation:**  Trigger simulated actions based on recognized gestures (e.g., print to console "Lights ON," "Volume Up").
- **Gesture Training/Calibration (Optional):**  Allow for user calibration of gestures for improved accuracy.
- **Basic UI:** A simple visual representation of recognized gestures.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and test webcam access. Capture a small dataset of training images/videos for each gesture.
2. **Gesture Detection Model:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect hand landmarks. Implement simple gesture classification based on landmark positions (e.g., distance between fingers).
3. **Smart Home Simulation:** Create a basic script to simulate smart home devices and their response to gesture commands.
4. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate gesture recognition with the smart home simulation. Test the system's accuracy and responsiveness.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time permits, explore using a machine learning model (e.g., a lightweight TensorFlow Lite model) for more robust gesture recognition.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with limited training data can be challenging.  Experimentation with different feature extraction techniques might be needed.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing real-time processing with accuracy requires careful optimization of the code and algorithms.  Consider using efficient data structures and algorithms.


## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with computer vision techniques, specifically real-time video processing and gesture recognition.
- Practical application of machine learning concepts (if using a machine learning model) for classification tasks.
