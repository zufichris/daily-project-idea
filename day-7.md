# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera, leveraging WebRTC for streaming and a pre-trained object detection model.  The goal is to demonstrate the integration of computer vision with real-time communication technologies, ideal for applications like remote monitoring or collaborative robotics.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for object detection), WebRTC (using a suitable Python wrapper like `aiortc`), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A web camera, a suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code), potentially a virtual machine for efficient resource management.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  Capture video from a webcam and stream it using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a specific object (e.g., a person, a ball) in the video stream using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNet SSD).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes around the detected objects on the video stream.
- **Basic Statistics:** Display basic statistics like the object's centroid coordinates.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple alert system (e.g., a sound or visual cue) when the object leaves a predefined area.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Allow multiple clients to view the stream and tracked object information simultaneously.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, aiortc, NumPy). Download a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Webcam Streaming:** Implement WebRTC server and client components to stream webcam footage.  Focus on a simple peer-to-peer setup for a daily challenge.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Integrate the pre-trained model into the stream processing pipeline to detect and track the chosen object.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and display basic statistics on the streamed video.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and object movements. Refine parameters for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:**  Balancing real-time processing with the computational demands of object detection might require careful model selection and optimization techniques.
- **Network Latency:** WebRTC performance can be sensitive to network conditions. Consider using a local network for testing to minimize latency issues.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Video Processing:** Gain experience in processing video streams in real-time, combining computer vision with network communication.
- **WebRTC Integration:** Understand the fundamentals of WebRTC and its applications beyond simple video conferencing.
