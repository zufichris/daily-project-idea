# Mini-Max AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Mini-Max AI algorithm for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe and visualize its decision-making process using a simple graphical user interface (GUI).  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental AI concept (game tree search) in a concise and easily understandable context.  It provides a practical example of implementing and visualizing an AI algorithm within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Library:** Pygame (or a similar lightweight library like Tkinter)
- **Data Structures:** Lists, Dictionaries (for game board representation and algorithm data)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Play:**  The user plays against the AI. The AI should use the Mini-Max algorithm to make optimal moves.
- **AI Opponent:** Implementation of a Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimization.
- **Win/Lose/Draw Detection:** Accurate detection of game states and display of the result.
- **Visual Board:** A graphical representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board updated after each move.
- **Move History (Optional):**  Display of the sequence of moves made by both the player and the AI.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Highlighting the AI's evaluated paths on the board to showcase its decision process visually.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Adding a difficulty setting (e.g., allowing the AI to make random moves with a certain probability to simulate varying skill levels).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board Representation:** Create a data structure (list or 2D array) to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board and functions to update the board based on player moves.
2. **Mini-Max Algorithm:** Implement the Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency. This involves recursively exploring the game tree to find the optimal move.
3. **GUI Development:** Create a simple GUI using Pygame (or Tkinter) to display the game board, handle user input, and update the board after each move.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the AI algorithm and the GUI.  The GUI should receive user input, send it to the AI, receive the AI's move, and update the board accordingly.
5. **Win/Lose/Draw Logic:**  Implement functions to detect win, lose, or draw conditions and display the outcome.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  The Mini-Max algorithm's computational complexity can increase exponentially. Alpha-beta pruning is crucial for managing this in a reasonable time.
- **GUI Responsiveness:** Ensuring the GUI remains responsive while the AI is calculating its move is important; consider using threading or asynchronous programming if necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of AI concepts:**  This project reinforces the understanding of game tree search, the Mini-Max algorithm, and alpha-beta pruning.
- **GUI development practice:** This project provides practical experience with GUI development using a library like Pygame, including event handling and visual representation of data.
