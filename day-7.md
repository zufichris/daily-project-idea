# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project focuses on building a prototype for a micro-gesture recognition system that can control smart home devices.  The system will utilize a readily available computer vision library to recognize subtle hand gestures from a webcam feed, translating these gestures into commands for controlling smart lights or other compatible devices. This aims to create a more intuitive and hands-free interface for smart home automation, replacing traditional voice or app-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe,  a smart home control API (e.g., Home Assistant API, Philips Hue API)
- **Tools:**  A webcam,  a personal computer with sufficient processing power.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., hand wave for lights on/off, fist for volume up, open palm for volume down).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Send commands to a smart home device (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume) based on recognized gestures.
- **User Calibration:** Allow for user-specific calibration to improve gesture recognition accuracy.
- **Visual Feedback:** Provide visual feedback (e.g., on-screen display) indicating which gesture was recognized.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Device Control:** Extend control to multiple smart home devices.
- **Gesture Learning:** Implement a simple machine learning model to allow the system to learn new gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, chosen smart home API library).  Set up the webcam feed.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe's hand tracking module to detect hand landmarks in the webcam feed.  Define thresholds and logic to differentiate between the chosen gestures.
3. **Command Mapping:** Create a mapping between recognized gestures and smart home commands.
4. **API Integration:**  Integrate the chosen smart home API to send commands based on gesture recognition.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and gestures. Adjust thresholds and refine the gesture recognition logic as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition, especially with varying lighting conditions and hand positions, can be challenging.  Employing techniques like background subtraction and hand region of interest (ROI) focusing can help mitigate this.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing the webcam feed in real-time requires efficient algorithms and optimization to avoid lag.  Consider simplifying the gesture recognition process or using more efficient algorithms if performance issues arise.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time video processing and gesture recognition.
- **API Integration:**  Develop skills in integrating different software components and APIs (smart home and computer vision).
