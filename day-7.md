# AI-Powered Smart Home Appliance Control Prototype

## Overview
This project aims to create a prototype for an AI-powered system that can intelligently control smart home appliances based on user preferences and real-time environmental data.  The focus will be on a single appliance (e.g., smart thermostat) for the sake of the daily challenge scope.  This allows for rapid prototyping and demonstrates a key concept in smart home automation—intelligent automation beyond simple scheduling.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework/Library:**  Flask (for a simple REST API), scikit-learn (for machine learning model), requests (for API interaction with a smart thermostat simulator).
* **Tools:**  VS Code or similar IDE, a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A smart thermostat (e.g., Nest, Ecobee) and its corresponding API access.  A simulator can replace this for the challenge.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Temperature Monitoring:** The system should fetch real-time temperature data (either simulated or from a real device).
- **User Preference Learning:**  The system should learn user temperature preferences through user-defined setpoints and feedback.
- **Predictive Temperature Control:** The system should predict optimal thermostat settings based on learned preferences and external factors (e.g., time of day, weather data – simulated for this challenge).
- **API Integration:** The system should interact with a smart thermostat simulator or a real device's API.
- **Basic User Interface:** A simple web interface or command-line interface to adjust settings and monitor system status.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment & Dependencies:** Create a Python virtual environment and install necessary libraries.  Create a basic Flask app structure.
2. **Develop a Smart Thermostat Simulator:** Create a simple simulator that provides temperature readings and accepts setpoint changes via API calls.  This substitutes for a real device.
3. **Implement Temperature Monitoring and Control Logic:**  Write the core logic to fetch temperature data, learn user preferences (e.g., using a simple linear regression model), and predict optimal temperature based on the learned model.
4. **Create the API Interface:** Build the Flask API endpoints for interacting with the smart thermostat simulator and enabling user interaction (setting preferences, retrieving data).
5. **Develop a Basic User Interface:** Create a simple command-line interface to interact with the system or a rudimentary web UI (using HTML/JS) to display the current temperature, setpoints, and predictions.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Data Acquisition:** Obtaining reliable and sufficient temperature data (if using a real device) might be challenging within the limited timeframe. Using a simulator mitigates this.
- **Model Accuracy:**  The simplicity of the machine learning model may limit the accuracy of predictions. Focusing on a simple model like linear regression is key to completing this in the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of API design and development principles:** This project offers practice in designing and implementing RESTful APIs.
- **Practical application of machine learning for automation:**  This project provides hands-on experience in applying a basic machine learning algorithm to a real-world control problem.
