# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures in a limited space and trigger pre-defined smart home actions. This offers a hands-free, intuitive alternative to traditional voice or touch controls, and provides a focused challenge for a two-day development sprint.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model optimization and deployment)
* **Framework:**  None (scripting approach is sufficient for this scope)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, (optional) Raspberry Pi for deployment.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open hand, clenched fist, thumbs up).
- **Action Triggering:**  Map each gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., turn lights on/off, adjust volume, play/pause music).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process video frames at a sufficient speed to provide a responsive user experience.
- **Calibration:** Allow for easy calibration of the system to account for different lighting conditions and camera positions.
- **UI:**  A simple on-screen display showing the recognized gesture and the corresponding action.

**Advanced Features (Optional):**

- **Model Training:** Train a custom machine learning model to improve gesture recognition accuracy.
- **Integration with Smart Home Platform:** Integrate the system with a smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant, IFTTT).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture video footage of the three chosen gestures.  Preprocess the videos to extract relevant frames.
2. **Feature Extraction:**  Use MediaPipe to extract hand landmarks from each frame.  Alternatively, implement simpler feature extraction methods if needed.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Implement a simple classification algorithm (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine) to classify gestures based on extracted features.
4. **Action Mapping & UI Development:**  Map classified gestures to smart home actions using simple logic. Create a basic UI to display the recognized gesture and triggered action.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system with various lighting conditions and user variations. Refine the algorithm and parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness:**  Achieving reliable gesture recognition across different lighting conditions and hand sizes can be challenging.  Consider using image augmentation techniques during model training (if using ML).
- **Real-time Performance:**  Processing video frames in real-time requires efficient algorithms and potentially optimized hardware.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical experience with computer vision techniques.** This project provides hands-on experience with image processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.
- **Develop skills in integrating different libraries and tools** to build a functional prototype.  This includes handling video streams, utilizing pre-trained models (MediaPipe), and implementing a basic UI.
