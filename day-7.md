# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype for controlling smart home devices using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model.  This offers a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional control methods, enhancing accessibility and user experience.  The focus will be on a limited set of gestures and devices for a rapid prototype.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  a relevant library for interacting with your smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant API, Philips Hue API).
- **Hardware:** Webcam (or pre-recorded video for initial testing),  a device compatible with chosen smart home API (e.g., smart light bulb).
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or IDE for Python development.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., hand open for "on," fist for "off," thumbs up for "dim").
- **Device Control:**  Control at least one smart home device (e.g., turn a light on/off, adjust brightness).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process gestures and update device status in real-time (or near real-time).
- **GUI (Optional):**  A simple graphical interface displaying recognized gestures and device status.
- **Calibration (Optional):** Allow for user-specific calibration to improve gesture recognition accuracy.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, smart home API library).  Choose a smart home device and its API.
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking solution.  Train or use a pre-trained model to recognize the chosen gestures.  Focus on achieving reasonable accuracy with minimal training data.
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Establish communication with the selected smart home device API. Implement functions to control the device based on recognized gestures.
4. **Real-time Processing Loop:** Combine steps 2 and 3 into a loop that continuously captures webcam input, detects gestures, and controls the device accordingly.
5. **GUI (Optional):** If time permits, create a basic GUI using a library like Tkinter or PyQt to display the recognized gesture and device status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Real-time gesture recognition can be sensitive to lighting conditions, hand positioning, and background clutter.  Focus on a controlled environment initially and limit gesture complexity.
- **API Integration:**  Interfacing with different smart home APIs might require different approaches and authentication methods.  Choose a well-documented and readily available API for simplicity.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience with OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Integration of Different Systems:** Learn how to integrate disparate systems (computer vision, smart home API) to build a functional application.
