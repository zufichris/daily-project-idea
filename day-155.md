#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration & Control

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simplified calibration and control system for a miniature robotic arm (e.g., a 3-DOF robotic arm kit).  The goal is to create a program that allows for precise calibration of the arm's joint angles and enables basic position control using a simple graphical interface. This project is significant because accurate calibration is crucial for the reliable operation of any robotic arm, and a day-long project allows focusing on core calibration strategies.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PySerial (for serial communication), NumPy (for numerical computation), Pygame (for GUI, optional), matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- **Hardware:** 3-DOF robotic arm kit (e.g., from Adafruit, SparkFun), microcontroller (e.g., Arduino), computer with serial port access.

## Features & Requirements
- **Joint Angle Calibration:**  The program should allow the user to manually set each joint to a known angle (e.g., 0 degrees) and record the corresponding sensor readings (e.g., potentiometer values).
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK) Solver (Simplified):** Implement a simplified IK solver for a 2D plane only, calculating joint angles based on a desired end-effector position.
- **Serial Communication:** Establish serial communication between the computer and the microcontroller to send control signals to the robotic arm.
- **Basic Control Interface:** A simple text-based interface allowing users to input desired joint angles or (in the simplified 2D case) target (x,y) coordinates.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log joint angles and sensor readings to a file for analysis.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup & Serial Communication:** Connect the robotic arm to the microcontroller and configure the serial communication between the microcontroller and the computer. Verify communication by sending and receiving test signals.
2. **Joint Angle Calibration:** Write a Python script to read sensor data from the microcontroller, allowing manual calibration of each joint to known angles.
3. **Implement Simplified 2D IK:** Develop a Python function to calculate joint angles required for a given end-effector (x,y) position in a simplified 2D plane, disregarding the Z-axis.
4. **Control Interface:** Create a basic text-based interface (or a simple Pygame GUI) to input target positions/joint angles, calculate the necessary angles using the IK solver (or use direct joint angle input), and send control signals to the arm via serial communication.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system by commanding the arm to different positions and observing its performance. Refine the calibration and control algorithms as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Sensors:** Sensor readings might be noisy or imprecise, requiring filtering or calibration techniques.  Consider using moving averages or other filtering techniques.
- **Simplified IK Limitations:** The 2D IK solution is a simplification and will not be applicable to general 3D movements. This limitation should be clearly stated in the project documentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of robotic arm kinematics and control:** The project directly involves implementing fundamental robotic concepts such as forward and inverse kinematics.
- **Practical experience with serial communication and embedded systems:** The project provides hands-on experience with interfacing a computer program with a microcontroller using serial communication, a common task in robotics and embedded systems.
