# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with Webcam Feed

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet effective real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The goal is to identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball, a person) within the camera's field of view, displaying bounding boxes and labels. This serves as a practical demonstration of computer vision techniques and their application in a real-world scenario.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (or a similar deep learning framework), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam (built-in or external)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Processing:**  The system should process video frames from the webcam in real-time.
- **Object Detection:**  The system should detect and identify the pre-selected object within each frame.
- **Bounding Box Display:**  Bounding boxes should be drawn around detected objects.
- **Object Tracking:** The system should track the identified object across consecutive frames.
- **Labeling:** The detected object should be labeled (e.g., "Red Ball", "Person").

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement object counting or trajectory plotting.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Allow user to select the object to track through a simple GUI.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy).
2. **Object Detection Model:** Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5) or fine-tune a model for the specific object.
3. **Webcam Input:** Access the webcam feed using OpenCV.
4. **Real-time Processing:** Process each frame, run object detection, draw bounding boxes, and display the results.
5. **Tracking Implementation:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.track()` function or a custom approach based on object centroid) to follow the object across frames.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially with complex models.  Consider using optimized models and reducing frame resolution if necessary.
- **Object Occlusion:** Handling situations where the object is temporarily occluded requires a robust tracking algorithm that can predict its location even when it's not directly visible.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** This project reinforces the application of computer vision techniques, including object detection, tracking, and real-time video processing.
- **Deep Learning Model Integration:**  The project provides hands-on experience integrating and utilizing pre-trained deep learning models within a larger application.
