#  Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will focus on recognizing a small set of predefined gestures, demonstrating the feasibility of a hands-free, intuitive interface for smart home automation. This project is significant because it explores a more natural and convenient interaction method compared to voice or touch interfaces, particularly in situations where voice commands are impractical or undesirable.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), a suitable smart home API library (e.g., Home Assistant API)
* **Tools:**  Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture & Processing:**  The system should capture webcam feed, detect hands and relevant keypoints using MediaPipe, and process the data to recognize predefined gestures (e.g., hand wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for increasing volume).
- **Gesture Recognition Engine:** Implement a simple gesture recognition algorithm (e.g., comparing keypoint distances and angles to predefined templates).
- **Smart Home Integration:** Send commands to a simulated or real smart home environment based on the recognized gesture.  (Lights on/off, volume control are suitable starting points).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display a visual representation of the recognized gesture and the corresponding action on the screen.
- **User Calibration:** Allow the user to calibrate the system to their specific hand size and gesture style.

**Advanced Features:**
- **Multiple User Support:** Extend the system to recognize gestures from multiple users simultaneously.
- **Machine Learning Integration:**  Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., using scikit-learn) to improve gesture recognition accuracy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, smart home API library). Set up the webcam and ensure correct access within the Python environment.
2. **Gesture Capture & Preprocessing:** Implement the pipeline to capture webcam feed, detect hands using MediaPipe, and extract relevant keypoints (e.g., fingertip positions). Preprocess the data (noise reduction, normalization).
3. **Gesture Recognition Algorithm:** Develop a simple algorithm to compare extracted keypoint data against predefined gesture templates.  Use basic geometric comparisons initially.
4. **Smart Home Command Integration:**  Implement the logic to send commands to the smart home environment based on the recognized gesture.  Start with a simulated environment if a real one isn't readily available.
5. **User Interface & Feedback:** Create a basic GUI to display the webcam feed, recognized gesture, and the corresponding smart home action.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  Handling variations in lighting, hand position, and user gesture style can be challenging.  Consider using techniques like data augmentation and smoothing to improve robustness.
- **Smart Home API Integration:**  The complexity of this step depends on the chosen smart home platform and API.  Start with a simplified simulated environment to avoid initial complexities.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project involves using OpenCV and MediaPipe for image processing and hand tracking, solidifying knowledge of these libraries and techniques.
- **Practice building real-time systems:** Developing a system that responds to input in real-time enhances understanding of event handling, asynchronous programming, and efficient resource management.
