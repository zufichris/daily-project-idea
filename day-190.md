# Robotic Arm Precision Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet effective, computer vision-based calibration system for a robotic arm.  The system will use a camera to track a known target (e.g., a colored marker) and adjust the robot's end-effector position to precisely reach the target's location. This improves the robotic arm's accuracy beyond its inherent limitations and showcases the synergy between computer vision and robotics.  The project focuses on a small-scale, proof-of-concept demonstration.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Robotics Library:** Robot Operating System (ROS) or a simplified library like PySerial if using a non-ROS-compatible arm.
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, hobbyist-grade arm will suffice), a USB camera, and a marker (e.g., a red circle printed on paper).

## Features & Requirements

- **Target Detection:**  The system must accurately detect the position of the marker in the camera's image using OpenCV.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK) Solution:**  The system must translate the detected marker coordinates into the required joint angles for the robotic arm to reach the target.  A simplified IK solution can be used if a full IK solution is too complex for the timeframe.
- **Arm Movement Control:**  The system must send commands to the robotic arm to move to the calculated joint angles.
- **Calibration Routine:**  A simple routine allowing the user to manually adjust calibration parameters if the arm consistently misses the target.
- **Error Reporting:** The system should provide feedback on the accuracy of the robot's movement (e.g., distance from target).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Real-time video feed with target overlay, automatic calibration adjustment based on error analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Calibration:** Set up the camera, robotic arm, and marker.  Acquire the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters (or use default values for simplicity).  Establish communication between the computer and the robotic arm.
2. **Target Detection:** Implement the OpenCV code to detect the marker in the camera's image, extracting its pixel coordinates.
3. **Inverse Kinematics (IK):**  Implement a simplified IK solution (e.g., for a 2-DOF arm) or utilize a pre-existing library function.  Convert pixel coordinates to real-world coordinates and then to robot joint angles.
4. **Arm Control:** Send the calculated joint angles to the robotic arm using appropriate commands.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Run tests and fine-tune the system using the calibration routine. Adjust parameters based on performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accurate Camera Calibration:** Obtaining accurate camera parameters is crucial for precision. If time is short, using pre-calculated or default parameters might be necessary, which will impact overall accuracy.
- **Inverse Kinematics Complexity:** The complexity of IK depends on the robotic arm's degrees of freedom (DOF). A simplified IK solution might be necessary for a 1-day project.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision techniques:**  This project solidifies knowledge of image processing, feature detection, and camera calibration.
- **Practical application of Robotics and Control:** This project provides hands-on experience in robot control, inverse kinematics, and the integration of computer vision with robotics.
