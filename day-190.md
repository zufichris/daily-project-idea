# Robotic Arm Calibration via Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, deep-learning-based calibration system for a robotic arm.  The goal is to train a model to correct for minor positional inaccuracies in the arm's movements using a small dataset of observed vs. commanded positions.  This is relevant for improving the precision of robotic arms without requiring extensive manual calibration procedures.  The focus is on a streamlined solution suitable for rapid prototyping within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
* **Robotics Library:**  A suitable library depending on the robotic arm interface (e.g., ROS for ROS-compatible robots, custom library for direct control).
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib or similar.


## Features & Requirements
- **Data Acquisition:**  Capture a dataset of commanded vs. actual end-effector positions.  This could involve moving the arm to several pre-defined points and recording the deviations.
- **Model Training:** Train a simple neural network (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron) to predict the correction needed based on the commanded position.
- **Calibration Application:** Implement a function that takes the commanded position as input, feeds it to the trained model, and outputs the corrected position.
- **Real-time Correction (Optional):**  Integrate the calibration model into a control loop for real-time corrections.
- **Error Analysis:**  Evaluate the model's performance by comparing predicted and actual positions on a test dataset.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Manually move the robotic arm to several points and record the commanded and actual (measured) coordinates.  Aim for at least 50 data points.
2. **Model Design & Training:** Create and train a simple neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.  Experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters if time allows.
3. **Calibration Function:** Develop a function that utilizes the trained model to predict position corrections.
4. **Integration (Optional):**  If time permits, integrate the calibration function into the robot arm's control system for real-time correction.
5. **Evaluation:** Test the calibrated system's performance using a separate test dataset and analyze the error reduction achieved.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Data Quality:**  Inaccurate data collection will significantly impact model performance.  Consider using multiple sensors or averaging multiple measurements to improve data quality.
- **Model Complexity:** Balancing model complexity (to avoid overfitting) and accuracy might require careful tuning of hyperparameters.  Start with a simple model and iterate.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of deep learning principles:**  Practical application of neural network design, training, and evaluation.
- **Robotics System Integration:** Hands-on experience in integrating machine learning algorithms into a robotic control system.
