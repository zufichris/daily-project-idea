# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a miniature, wearable sensor array to recognize subtle hand gestures.  The system will translate these gestures into commands to control smart home devices like lights and appliances. This offers a more intuitive and seamless interaction compared to traditional voice or app-based control.  The focus for a 2-day challenge is on building a basic gesture recognition model and integrating it with a simple simulated smart home environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning), OpenCV (for image/video processing), potentially a library for serial communication (if using a physical sensor).
- **Hardware (Optional):** A small sensor array (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope), Arduino (if using a physical sensor).
- **Software:** A Python IDE (PyCharm, VS Code), potentially a simulator for smart home devices.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:** Capture hand gesture data using a webcam or a small sensor array.
- **Gesture Classification:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., a simple CNN or LSTM) to classify different gestures.
- **Command Translation:** Map classified gestures to specific smart home commands (e.g., "flick wrist" -> "turn on lights").
- **Simulated Home Control:**  Implement a simulated smart home environment (e.g., using print statements to represent light or appliance status changes).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual or auditory feedback to the user confirming gesture recognition and command execution.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a user calibration step to improve gesture recognition accuracy.  Incorporate different types of sensors.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:** Capture a dataset of hand gestures using the chosen input method (webcam video or sensor readings). Focus on 2-3 distinct gestures.
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model using the captured data to classify the gestures.
3. **Command Mapping:** Create a mapping between classified gestures and commands for the simulated smart home environment.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the gesture recognition model with the simulated smart home control system.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system with various inputs and refine the model or gesture definitions as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:** Gathering enough high-quality data for robust model training within a limited timeframe can be challenging.  Consider using pre-existing datasets if time is severely limited.
- **Model Complexity:** Balancing model complexity with training time and computational resources is crucial. A simpler model may be necessary for a 2-day timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with machine learning for real-time applications:** Gain hands-on experience with building, training, and integrating a machine learning model within a larger system.
- **Development of a functional prototype:** Develop a working system that demonstrates the feasibility of the concept, reinforcing the iterative software development process.
