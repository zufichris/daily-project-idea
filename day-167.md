# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Robot Arm

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated robotic arm within a constrained workspace.  The goal is to find the shortest, collision-free path for the arm to reach a target position, considering the arm's degrees of freedom and obstacles. This is relevant to various robotics applications like industrial automation and surgical robotics.  The daily challenge will focus on implementing and comparing different pathfinding algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for visualization)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- SciPy (optional, for optimization algorithms)


## Features & Requirements
- **Basic Pathfinding:** Implement A* search algorithm to find a collision-free path for a 2-DOF robotic arm.
- **Obstacle Representation:**  Define a workspace with static polygonal obstacles.
- **Collision Detection:** Implement basic collision detection between the arm links and obstacles.
- **Path Visualization:** Display the workspace, obstacles, robot arm, and found path using Pygame.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a path smoothing algorithm (e.g., BÃ©zier curves) to reduce sharp turns in the path.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Workspace Setup:** Define the workspace boundaries and create a list of polygonal obstacles using NumPy arrays.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* search algorithm using a suitable heuristic (e.g., Euclidean distance).  The nodes will represent arm configurations (joint angles).
3. **Collision Detection:** Implement collision detection for each arm link against the obstacles.  Use simple bounding box checks for this daily challenge.
4. **Path Visualization:** Use Pygame to visualize the workspace, obstacles, the robotic arm's movement, and the calculated path.
5. **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a simple smoothing algorithm, such as a moving average filter, if time allows.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** A* can be computationally expensive for high-DOF arms or complex workspaces. Focus on optimizing the algorithm and collision detection for a 2-DOF arm within a reasonable workspace size for the daily time constraint.
- **Heuristic Selection:** The choice of heuristic significantly impacts A*'s performance. Experimenting with different heuristics might be necessary for optimal results.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces understanding of pathfinding algorithms (specifically A*) and their implementation.
- Develops skills in collision detection and visualization techniques in a robotics context.
