# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning techniques.  The game will be deliberately simplistic to allow for significant progress within a one- or two-day timeframe.  This project emphasizes practical application of RL concepts and efficient implementation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple game environment (e.g., a grid-based navigation task with rewards and penalties).
    - An AI agent using a Q-learning algorithm or a simpler variant.
    - Training the agent to maximize its cumulative reward.
    - Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., plots of cumulative reward over time).
    - Basic agent action selection (e.g., up, down, left, right).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing an ε-greedy exploration strategy.
    - Using a neural network for function approximation instead of a simple Q-table.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement a simple game environment using OpenAI Gym or create a custom environment using Python libraries like Pygame.  Define the state space, action space, reward structure, and termination conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent with a Q-table (initially) or a simple neural network. Define the agent's learning rate, discount factor, and exploration strategy.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively interacts with the environment, updates the Q-table (or neural network weights), and collects reward data.  Visualize the learning progress (e.g., plot cumulative rewards).
4. **Evaluation:**  After training, evaluate the agent's performance by letting it play the game without exploration (ε=0) and record its score or success rate.
5. **Refinement:** Iterate on the agent's hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, ε) and potentially explore more advanced algorithms or neural network architectures based on time constraints.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can be time-consuming. A systematic approach (e.g., grid search or random search) is beneficial, but might need to be simplified for the short timeframe.
- **Environment Complexity:** Balancing environment simplicity with a degree of challenge is crucial.  An overly simple environment might lead to trivial solutions, whereas a complex one will hinder progress within the given timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals (Q-learning, exploration/exploitation).
- Practical experience in implementing and training RL agents.
- Understanding of the trade-offs between different RL algorithms and their hyperparameters.
