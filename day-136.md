# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a system that uses a Raspberry Pi to detect and track objects in real-time using a connected camera.  This system could be a foundation for various applications, from simple object counting to more complex robotics tasks such as autonomous navigation. The focus is on creating a functional prototype within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for efficient model deployment), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (with sufficient processing power and camera module), USB Camera (optional, if Pi camera unavailable)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect predefined objects (e.g., person, car, ball) in the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected objects across frames, maintaining their identification.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Display bounding boxes around detected objects on the camera feed.
- **FPS Measurement:** Calculate and display the frames per second (FPS) to gauge performance.
- **Basic Object Counting:** Count the number of instances of a specific object detected within a defined region.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a simple user interface (GUI) for adjusting detection thresholds and selecting objects to track.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Store and display detection data (e.g., object location, timestamps) in a database or log file.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries on the Raspberry Pi (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, NumPy). Download a pre-trained object detection model compatible with TensorFlow Lite (e.g., MobileNet SSD).
2. **Camera Setup:** Configure the camera module or USB camera to stream video to the Raspberry Pi.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement the core logic using OpenCV to read video frames, run inference with the TensorFlow Lite model, draw bounding boxes, and perform basic tracking (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.track` functions).
4. **FPS Measurement and Display:** Add code to calculate and display FPS on the video stream.
5. **Object Counting (if implementing):** Define a region of interest and count object instances that pass through.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Resources:** Balancing accuracy and speed on the Raspberry Pi's limited processing power. This might necessitate choosing a lightweight object detection model.  Consider using model optimization techniques if FPS is too low.
- **Accuracy and Robustness:** Pre-trained models may not be perfectly accurate for all scenarios.  Address potential inaccuracies by experimenting with different models or adjusting detection thresholds.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience in real-time object detection and tracking using OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite.
- **Embedded System Development:**  Strengthen skills in deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi.
