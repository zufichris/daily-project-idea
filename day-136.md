# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web browser and WebRTC.  The system will detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in a video stream from a webcam, track its movement, and display the tracked object's position on the screen. This demonstrates a combination of client-side computer vision and real-time communication, useful for various applications like remote robotics or augmented reality.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow.js (for object detection), WebRTC (for video streaming)
- **Tools:** A web browser (Chrome recommended), a webcam.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  Capture webcam video using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the video stream using a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across frames.
- **Position Display:** Display the object's bounding box and coordinates on the video stream.
- **FPS Display:** Show frames per second to gauge performance.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple user interface to allow selection of the object to be tracked.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate with a server to share the tracking data with other clients.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up WebRTC:** Establish a connection to the webcam using WebRTC and display the video stream on a canvas element.
2. **Load TensorFlow.js Model:** Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD) using TensorFlow.js.
3. **Implement Object Detection:**  Process each frame from the webcam stream using the loaded model to detect the target object.
4. **Implement Object Tracking:** Use a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
5. **Display Results:**  Draw a bounding box around the detected object and display its coordinates on the canvas.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:**  Balancing the accuracy of object detection with the real-time processing demands of WebRTC can be challenging.  Consider reducing the input image resolution or using a less computationally intensive model if necessary.
- **Robust Tracking:**  Simple tracking algorithms may struggle with occlusion or fast movements.  Exploring more advanced tracking techniques might be needed for a more robust solution.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of WebRTC:** This project provides hands-on experience with real-time communication via WebRTC.
- **Gain experience with client-side computer vision:** This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow.js for object detection and tracking within a browser environment.
