# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Robot

## Overview
This project focuses on developing and implementing an optimized pathfinding algorithm for a simulated robot navigating a dynamically changing environment.  The goal is to create a system that efficiently finds the shortest or most cost-effective path, considering obstacles and potential changes in the environment. This is a valuable exercise in algorithm design and implementation, relevant to many robotics and AI applications.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `pygame` (for visualization), `networkx` (for graph representation and pathfinding algorithms),  `numpy` (optional, for performance optimization).


## Features & Requirements
- **Environment Representation:**  Create a 2D grid-based environment with randomly placed static and dynamic obstacles.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal point, avoiding obstacles.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:** The system should recalculate the path if a dynamic obstacle moves into the robot's path.
- **Visualization:**  Use `pygame` to visually represent the environment, robot, path, and obstacles in real-time.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a path smoothing algorithm (e.g., BÃ©zier curves) to create a more natural-looking robot trajectory.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create the 2D grid environment using `pygame`, including static and dynamic obstacles.  Represent the environment as a graph using `networkx`.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* algorithm using `networkx` or write a custom implementation.  Define appropriate heuristics (e.g., Manhattan distance).
3. **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:**  Implement a mechanism to detect changes in the environment (obstacle movement) and trigger path recalculation using the A* algorithm.
4. **Visualization:** Display the environment, robot path, and obstacles using `pygame`. Update the visualization in real-time as the robot moves and obstacles change.
5. **(Optional) Path Smoothing:** Implement a path smoothing algorithm to improve the visual appeal and potentially the efficiency of the robot's movement.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Efficient Obstacle Detection:**  Finding an efficient way to detect collisions with dynamic obstacles without excessive computational overhead.  Consider using spatial partitioning data structures.
- **Heuristic Choice:** Selecting an appropriate heuristic for the A* algorithm that balances accuracy and computational cost.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of graph-based pathfinding algorithms (A*) and their practical implementation.
- Practical experience in handling dynamic environments and real-time updates in a simulated robotic context.
