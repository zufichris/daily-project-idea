# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a standard webcam.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of predefined micro-gestures, eliminating the need for complex, full-body motion tracking. This offers a more natural and unobtrusive interaction method compared to voice commands or touch interfaces.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe (Hands solution)
- A suitable Smart Home API (e.g., Home Assistant API, Philips Hue API)

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., thumb up/down, hand open/close) for controlling different smart home functions.
- **Real-time Processing:** Process webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Device Control:** Integrate with a smart home API to trigger actions (e.g., turn lights on/off, adjust volume).
- **GUI:** A simple graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter to display the recognized gesture and control parameters.
- **Calibration:**  Allow the user to calibrate the system to their specific hand size and position.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporating hand orientation detection for finer control.
- **Optional Feature:** Adding a gesture for pausing/resuming gesture recognition.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).  Set up the chosen smart home API connection.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe's hand detection and tracking.  Develop a simple logic to classify the predefined gestures based on landmark positions.
3. **API Integration:** Write functions to send commands to the smart home API based on the recognized gestures.
4. **GUI Development:** Create a basic GUI to display the recognized gesture, confidence score, and allow users to calibrate the system.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different hand positions and lighting conditions. Refine gesture recognition logic and calibration parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness to Noise:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand positioning, and background clutter in real-time webcam feed.  Consider implementing noise reduction techniques or pre-processing steps.
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Ensuring accurate and consistent recognition of gestures across different users and conditions. This might require data augmentation or more sophisticated machine learning techniques if time allows.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Gain practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and object detection.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Learn how to integrate a custom application with a smart home API, enabling control of physical devices through software.
