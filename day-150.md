# Automated Bug Report Triaging System (Prototype)

## Overview

This project aims to create a rudimentary prototype of an automated bug report triaging system.  This system will analyze incoming bug reports (simulated or from a real, limited source) and categorize them based on keywords, severity, and potential impact.  The significance lies in automating a time-consuming manual process for software development teams.  This prototype focuses on a simplified version achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python:** For scripting and natural language processing.
- **NLTK or spaCy:** For natural language processing tasks (tokenization, stemming, etc.).
- **Scikit-learn:**  For machine learning (classification if time permits).
- **SQLite:** For simple database storage of bug reports and classifications.
- **Text editor/IDE:** (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)


## Features & Requirements

- **Input Processing:**  Read bug reports from a text file or simulated input (e.g., JSON).
- **Keyword Extraction:** Extract relevant keywords from bug reports using NLTK/spaCy.
- **Severity Classification:** Assign a severity level (e.g., low, medium, high) based on keywords and report description (simple rules-based approach).
- **Category Assignment:** Categorize bugs into predefined categories (e.g., UI, backend, database).
- **Basic Report Generation:** Output a summarized report of classified bugs.

- **Optional:  Naive Bayes Classifier:** Train a simple Naive Bayes classifier on a small dataset of labeled bug reports to improve classification accuracy.
- **Optional:  Visualization:** Generate basic charts showing the distribution of bug categories and severities.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Setup:** Create a sample dataset of bug reports (simulated or real, small scale). This could be a simple text file or a small database.
2. **Keyword Extraction & Preprocessing:** Implement keyword extraction using NLTK/spaCy, including tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
3. **Rule-based Classification:**  Develop a set of rules based on keywords to classify bug reports into severity levels and categories.
4. **Report Generation:**  Write the code to output a summary of the classified bugs.
5. **(Optional) Classifier Training:** If time permits, train a simple Naive Bayes classifier on the sample dataset.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Ambiguity in Natural Language:**  Dealing with the inherent ambiguity of natural language in bug reports is a significant challenge.  The rules-based approach might require significant refinement.
- **Data Limitations:**  With a limited dataset, the accuracy of any machine learning model will be constrained. Focus on a robust rule-based system for a successful day-long project.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with keyword extraction and text preprocessing techniques.
- **Rule-Based System Design:** Develop skills in designing and implementing rule-based systems for automated decision-making.
