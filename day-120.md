# Self-Balancing Robot Control Algorithm Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing a control algorithm for a self-balancing robot, aiming to improve its stability and responsiveness.  The goal is to implement and test different control strategies (e.g., PID, LQR) and compare their performance under varying conditions using simulation.  This project is significant because effective control algorithms are crucial for the robustness and reliability of any self-balancing robot.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, possibly a robotics simulation library like PyBullet or V-REP (if time permits a full simulation).
- **Hardware (Optional):** A small self-balancing robot (e.g., Arduino-based) for real-world testing (this is an advanced feature and might not be feasible within the timeframe).

## Features & Requirements

- **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain balance.
- **Setpoint Tracking:** The robot should be able to maintain a desired angle (e.g., upright position).
- **Disturbance Rejection:** The robot should be able to recover from small disturbances (e.g., a gentle push).
- **Performance Metrics:**  Measure and record key performance indicators like settling time and overshoot.
- **Data Visualization:** Plot the robot's angle, motor commands, and other relevant data over time.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller for comparison.  Real-world testing on a physical robot (requires appropriate hardware).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Development:** Create a simplified mathematical model of the self-balancing robot (e.g., inverted pendulum).
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Code a PID controller using Python and the chosen libraries.  Initialize controller gains empirically.
3. **Simulation and Tuning:** Simulate the robot's behavior using the implemented PID controller and fine-tune the controller gains to achieve optimal performance.
4. **LQR Controller (Optional):**  Implement an LQR controller using SciPy's optimization tools and compare its performance to the PID controller.
5. **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Analyze the simulation results, plot graphs, and compare the performance of different control strategies.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Gain Tuning:** Finding optimal PID or LQR gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments. Systematic approaches like Ziegler-Nichols method can be employed.
- **Model Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the simplified model will affect the controller's performance.  More complex models can improve accuracy but increase complexity.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of control system design:** This project will solidify knowledge of PID and LQR controllers, their implementation, and tuning techniques.
- **Improve proficiency in Python and relevant libraries:**  Hands-on experience with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for numerical computation, optimization, and data visualization will be gained.
