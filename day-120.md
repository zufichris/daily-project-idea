# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The focus is on prototyping a functional AI within a short timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts.  The significance lies in understanding and implementing a practical application of RL in a constrained environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An RL agent capable of learning through self-play.
    - A simple reward system for wins, losses, and draws.
    - Basic visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., win rate over time).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing different RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
    - Incorporating exploration vs. exploitation techniques (e.g., ε-greedy).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Create a simple game environment (using OpenAI Gym or custom code) that provides state representation, action space, and reward signals.
2. **Implement the RL agent:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement it using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.  Focus on a basic implementation initially.
3. **Train the agent:** Run the training loop, allowing the agent to play numerous games against itself and learn optimal strategies based on the reward system.
4. **Evaluate performance:**  Assess the agent's performance against a simple rule-based agent or a human player.
5. **Visualize results:** Plot metrics like win rate, average reward, or Q-value convergence over training iterations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing exploration and exploitation:** Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions is crucial for efficient learning.  Adjusting hyperparameters (like ε in ε-greedy) might be necessary.
- **Computational resources:** Training an RL agent, especially with complex games, can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the game environment or using a less computationally demanding algorithm might be required to fit within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of Reinforcement Learning principles (e.g., Q-learning, state-action space).
- Experience with implementing and training RL agents using popular libraries like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
