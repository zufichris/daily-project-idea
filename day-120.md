# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified intelligent traffic light system using agent-based modeling.  The goal is to create a basic intersection with multiple lanes and vehicles, where traffic light timing is dynamically adjusted based on vehicle density in each lane. This offers a simplified model for exploring optimization strategies in traffic management.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  NumPy (for numerical operations), Matplotlib (for visualization), Pygame (for simple graphical representation).  Consider using a more advanced visualization library like Pyglet for smoother animation.

## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Randomly generate vehicles entering the intersection at varying intervals and speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light system with a timer.
- **Density-Based Adjustment:** The traffic light cycle length should dynamically adjust based on the number of vehicles waiting at each lane.  Longer queues should trigger a faster switch to that lane's green light.
- **Vehicle Movement:**  Simulate vehicle movement within the lanes, respecting traffic light signals and avoiding collisions.
- **Visualization:** Display a simple graphical representation of the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light states.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement different traffic light control algorithms (e.g., adaptive control using machine learning). Integrate vehicle types with varying speeds and sizes.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Setup:** Create the intersection layout (lanes, traffic lights) using Pygame. Implement vehicle generation and movement.
2. **Traffic Light Implementation:**  Implement a basic timer-based traffic light system.
3. **Density Measurement:**  Add code to continuously monitor the number of vehicles waiting at each lane.
4. **Adaptive Control:** Develop a simple algorithm to adjust the traffic light timer based on lane density.  Prioritize lanes with the highest vehicle counts.
5. **Visualization Enhancement:** Improve the visual representation of vehicles and traffic flow to ensure clear feedback.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Optimization:**  Finding an efficient algorithm to dynamically adjust the traffic light timing without causing oscillations or deadlock situations can be challenging.  Start with a simple heuristic and iteratively refine it.
- **Collision Avoidance:**  Ensuring vehicles do not collide requires careful management of vehicle positions and speeds.  Simple collision detection might suffice for a basic simulation.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Agent-Based Modeling:** This project provides hands-on experience with agent-based modeling techniques used to simulate complex systems.
- **Algorithm Design and Optimization:**  Developing and improving the traffic light control algorithm enhances problem-solving and optimization skills.
