# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game using reinforcement learning techniques.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the core concepts of reinforcement learning within a limited timeframe.  This is significant because it allows for a hands-on understanding of a powerful AI technique without requiring extensive development time.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (or similar IDE)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple game environment (e.g., a grid-based navigation problem or a simplified version of a classic game).
    - An AI agent implemented using a Q-learning algorithm.
    - Training the agent to achieve a specific goal within the game environment.
    - Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., reward over time, win rate).
    - Basic logging of training data.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for more complex environments.
    - Integration with a GUI for a more interactive experience.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment using OpenAI Gym or create a custom environment in Python. This could be as simple as a grid with a start and goal point.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent.  Start with a simple tabular Q-table and gradually explore more sophisticated approaches if time allows.
3. **Training Loop:** Design and implement a training loop that iteratively interacts with the environment, updates the Q-table, and tracks the agent's performance.
4. **Visualization & Logging:** Implement basic visualization to monitor the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting rewards over episodes). Log key metrics for analysis.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Evaluate the agent's performance and make adjustments to parameters (learning rate, exploration rate, etc.) to improve its learning efficiency.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Environment Design:**  Creating a well-defined and balanced game environment that's both simple enough for rapid prototyping but complex enough to be challenging for the agent.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the Q-learning algorithm can be time-consuming.  Start with reasonable defaults and iterate based on observed performance.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning concepts: Understanding the fundamental principles of Q-learning, exploration-exploitation trade-off, and reward functions.
- Python programming for AI:  Practicing Python coding skills for implementing AI algorithms and interacting with game environments.
