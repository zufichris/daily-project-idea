# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a readily available webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, thumbs up) to trigger predefined smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).  This demonstrates a compact, hands-free alternative to traditional voice or touch-based control, focusing on rapid prototyping and proof-of-concept.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  PyAutoGUI (for simulated input)
* **Hardware:** Webcam (built-in or external),  Computer (laptop or desktop)
* **Optional:** A smart home hub or simulator for direct control (e.g., Home Assistant API).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Accurately detect and track hand movements from the webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Classify three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, thumbs up) with a reasonable accuracy level.
- **Action Mapping:**  Assign each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., "Open Palm" = turn lights on, "Fist" = turn lights off, "Thumbs Up" = increase volume).
- **User Interface (Optional):** A simple graphical interface to display recognized gestures and allow users to customize gesture-action mappings.
- **Simulated Control (Initial Phase):** Instead of direct smart home integration (optional), simulate actions by controlling the computer's volume or opening/closing applications using PyAutoGUI.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI).
2. **Implement hand tracking:** Use MediaPipe to capture and display hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
3. **Develop gesture recognition:**  Train a simple classifier (e.g., using k-nearest neighbors or a small neural network) to differentiate between pre-defined gestures based on hand landmark positions.
4. **Map gestures to actions:**  Implement logic to trigger simulated actions (or smart home commands if integrating with a hub) based on recognized gestures.
5. **Test and refine:** Evaluate accuracy and responsiveness, adjust classifier parameters or gesture definitions as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of gesture recognition:**  Hand tracking can be affected by lighting conditions and hand occlusions.  Robustness against these issues might require more advanced techniques or a larger training dataset.
- **Real-time performance:**  Processing webcam feed and performing gesture recognition needs to be fast enough to maintain real-time responsiveness. Optimization of the code might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on experience:** Gain practical experience in real-time computer vision, specifically hand tracking and gesture recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV.
- **Reinforcement of machine learning concepts:**  Develop an understanding of simple machine learning models for classification tasks and their application in a real-world problem.
