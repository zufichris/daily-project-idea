# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object tracking and classification system using WebRTC for video streaming and a pre-trained machine learning model for object detection. The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of WebRTC beyond simple video calls, integrating it with AI for a more sophisticated, interactive experience. This can be a foundation for various applications like remote robotics control, automated surveillance systems, or interactive art installations.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** OpenCV (Python), TensorFlow.js or similar (JavaScript), WebRTC APIs (JavaScript)
* **Tools:**  VS Code or similar IDE, a web server (e.g., Python's SimpleHTTPServer), a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5), a webcam or video feed source.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  Use WebRTC to stream video from a client device (e.g., a browser) to a server.
- **Object Detection:** Employ a pre-trained model to identify and classify objects within the streamed video frames.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected objects across consecutive frames, displaying bounding boxes and labels.
- **Data Visualization:** Display the detected objects and their tracking information (e.g., coordinates, class labels) on the client interface.
- **Basic UI:**  A simple HTML interface displaying the video stream and object detection results.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Server-side Processing:** Offload the object detection to the server to reduce client-side processing load.
- **Multiple Object Tracking:** Handle multiple objects efficiently and avoid ID switching issues.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up WebRTC Streaming:** Establish a basic WebRTC connection between client (browser) and server (Python). Ensure video streaming functionality works correctly.
2. **Integrate Object Detection:** Load a pre-trained model (using TensorFlow.js on the client or a server-side solution with Python and OpenCV) and integrate it with the video stream.
3. **Implement Object Tracking:** Employ a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `track.Tracker` functionalities or a custom implementation based on bounding box comparisons) to track the identified objects across frames.
4. **Develop User Interface:** Create a basic HTML interface to display the video feed with overlaid bounding boxes and labels.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various video inputs, adjust parameters, and address any issues with accuracy or performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Latency:** WebRTC introduces latency.  Employ efficient object detection and tracking algorithms to minimize the impact. Consider strategies for handling latency, such as prediction models.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right pre-trained model balancing accuracy, speed, and size is crucial for real-time performance on the client-side.  If using a server-side approach, the server hardware capacity needs to be accounted for.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical WebRTC Implementation:** Gain hands-on experience integrating WebRTC for real-time video streaming in a non-trivial application.
- **Real-time AI Integration:**  Learn to seamlessly integrate pre-trained machine learning models for real-time object detection and tracking within a web application.
