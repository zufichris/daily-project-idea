# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi and a readily available USB webcam. The system will detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view, displaying its location and classification on the screen. This project showcases the integration of computer vision, image processing, and real-time control, all within a constrained resource environment.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Raspberry Pi:**  A Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar) with sufficient processing power.
* **Python:** Programming language for the entire system.
* **OpenCV:**  Computer vision library for image processing and object detection.
* **TensorFlow Lite (Optional):** For advanced object classification using pre-trained models.
* **USB Webcam:** A standard USB webcam for image acquisition.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video frames from the webcam at a reasonable frame rate.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within each frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across consecutive frames.
- **Location Display:** Display the object's coordinates (x, y) on the video feed.
- **Classification (Optional):** Classify the object using a pre-trained model (e.g., TensorFlow Lite).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a user interface to adjust tracking parameters (sensitivity, color thresholds).  Implement object counting.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary packages (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite if using) on the Raspberry Pi. Connect the webcam.
2. **Video Capture & Preprocessing:**  Write code to capture video frames from the webcam using OpenCV. Perform basic image processing (e.g., color thresholding) to isolate the target object.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement object detection using color thresholding or a more sophisticated technique like background subtraction or feature detection.  Use OpenCV's tracking functions to track the detected object across frames.
4. **Location Display:** Overlay the object's bounding box and coordinates on the video feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Classification (Optional):** Integrate a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to classify the detected object and display the classification result.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power may limit the frame rate and the complexity of the algorithms that can be used. Optimizations might be necessary.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can affect object detection accuracy. Robustness to varying lighting conditions should be considered.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of computer vision concepts:**  This project solidifies understanding of image processing techniques, object detection, and tracking algorithms.
- **Practical experience with embedded systems:**  Working with a Raspberry Pi and integrating hardware and software components provide valuable experience in embedded systems development.
