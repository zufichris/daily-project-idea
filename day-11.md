# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, game AI using reinforcement learning (RL). The goal is to create an agent that can learn to play a basic game, like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, and achieve a high win rate within a day or two. This project demonstrates a practical application of RL and allows for experimentation with different RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, if necessary), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL algorithm implementation), NumPy (for numerical computation)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -  A playable game environment (either built-in or using OpenAI Gym).
    -  An RL agent that learns through trial and error.
    -  Training loop that allows for monitoring of agent performance (win rate, average reward).
    -  Basic visualization of the game and agent's actions.
    -  Saving and loading of trained agent models.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Implementation of different RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Network).
    -  Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Environment:** Choose a game (Tic-Tac-Toe is recommended for simplicity) and create the game logic.  If using OpenAI Gym, find or create an appropriate environment. Otherwise, implement the game's rules and reward function in Python.
2. **Choose an RL Algorithm:** Select a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning for a simpler approach, or a DQN for a more complex challenge).  Implement the chosen algorithm.
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the training loop, allowing the agent to play numerous games against itself or a simple rule-based opponent.  Monitor performance metrics to assess learning progress.
4. **Evaluate Performance:** Test the trained agent against a human player or a stronger opponent to assess its performance.
5. **(Optional) Refine and Improve:** If time permits, experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, or environment modifications to improve the agent's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Depending on the chosen RL algorithm and the complexity of the game, training might be computationally expensive.  Simplifying the game or using a less computationally intensive algorithm can mitigate this.
- **Reward Function Design:**  Designing an effective reward function is crucial for the agent's learning.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to unintended behavior. Experimentation and adjustments are usually necessary.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application and understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Experience with implementing and evaluating RL agents in a simple game environment.
- Hands-on experience with Python libraries for numerical computation and machine learning.
