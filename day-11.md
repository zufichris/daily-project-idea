# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robot Navigation

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI-powered image captioning system integrated with simulated robot navigation.  The goal is to create a system where a robot, given an image from its "camera," can generate a caption describing the scene (e.g., "Clear path ahead," "Obstacle detected: box," "Turning left at intersection") and use this caption to inform its navigation decisions. This simplifies the complex task of object recognition and scene understanding for basic autonomous navigation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) for image processing
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for the image captioning model (pre-trained model recommended for time constraints)
- A simple robot simulator (e.g., Pygame, VPython, or a pre-built simulator API)

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Capture a simulated image from the robot's perspective. Preprocess the image for the model (resizing, normalization).
- **Caption Generation:** Use a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., a smaller, faster model like Show, Attend and Tell) to generate a descriptive caption.
- **Caption Parsing & Decision-Making:**  Implement a simple rule-based system to parse the generated caption. For example, if the caption contains "obstacle," the robot should stop and re-plan its path.
- **Basic Navigation Simulation:** The robot should move in a simulated 2D environment based on the parsed caption and simple navigation logic.
- **Output Display:**  Display the input image, generated caption, and the robot's current position and movement on the screen.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Integrate with a more sophisticated path-planning algorithm (A*, Dijkstra's).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a simple feedback loop where the robot's actions influence subsequent image captioning and navigation.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries and set up the robot simulator. Choose and load a pre-trained image captioning model.
2. **Image Processing and Captioning:** Write functions to capture a simulated image, preprocess it, and pass it to the captioning model to receive a textual description.
3. **Caption Parsing and Navigation:** Create a rule-based system to parse the generated caption and translate it into simple navigation commands (e.g., move forward, turn left/right, stop).
4. **Simulate Robot Movement:** Update the robot's position in the simulator based on the navigation commands.
5. **Display Results:** Visualize the image, caption, and robot's movement within the simulator environment.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model that balances accuracy with inference speed is crucial for a one or two-day project.  Smaller models are preferred.
- **Caption Parsing Robustness:**  The rule-based system needs to be robust enough to handle variations in caption phrasing while avoiding oversimplification.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of image captioning techniques and their applications beyond traditional image analysis.
- Practical experience in integrating AI models with robotic systems for a specific task.
