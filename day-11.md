* **Software:** Arduino IDE, a Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Autonomous Maze Navigation:** The robot should autonomously navigate a predefined maze using sensor data and a pathfinding algorithm.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot should detect and avoid obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor.
- **Goal Detection:** The robot should identify and reach the maze's exit.
- **Basic Motor Control:**  Precise control of the robot's movement using the DC motors.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Record sensor readings and motor commands for analysis.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* with heuristics for optimal path selection).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate multiple sensor types for improved obstacle detection and navigation (e.g., adding infrared sensors for proximity sensing).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the sensors and motors to the microcontroller.  Flash the Arduino code for basic sensor reading and motor control. Test individual motor and sensor functionality.
2. **Basic Navigation Algorithm:** Implement a simple wall-following algorithm or a basic breadth-first search in Python to control the robot's movement based on sensor readings received from the Arduino.
3. **Sensor Integration:**  Incorporate the sensor data into the navigation algorithm to enable obstacle avoidance.
4. **Pathfinding Implementation:** Integrate a more advanced pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) if time permits.  This might involve pre-mapping the maze or using a real-time mapping approach.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the robot's performance in the maze and refine the algorithm or hardware setup as needed to optimize navigation efficiency.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:** Ultrasonic sensors can be prone to noise, requiring appropriate filtering or averaging techniques in the code.
- **Algorithm Complexity:** Implementing and debugging a sophisticated pathfinding algorithm within a short timeframe might be challenging. Prioritize a simpler algorithm first if necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Integration:** Gain practical experience in integrating sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers in a robotic system.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation:**  Understand and apply pathfinding algorithms for autonomous navigation, learning about their complexities and trade-offs.
