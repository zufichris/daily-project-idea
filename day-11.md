# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and developing a basic AI agent to play it using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The focus is on rapid prototyping using a readily available RL library. The game's simplicity allows for significant progress in a short timeframe, illustrating key RL concepts. The project aims to demonstrate the power of RL in solving simple game problems efficiently.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for RL implementation)
- Pygame (for game development and visualization)
- A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game (e.g., a grid-based movement game where the agent needs to reach a target while avoiding obstacles).
    - An AI agent trained using a Reinforcement Learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler variant).
    - Real-time visualization of the agent's learning process and gameplay.
    - Basic reward system (e.g., +1 for reaching the target, -1 for hitting an obstacle).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Incorporating a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    - Adding a simple user interface for adjusting game parameters and AI settings.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Development:** Design and implement the basic game mechanics using Pygame.  Focus on a minimal, functional game first.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm and implement the agent's logic using PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras.  Start with a simple algorithm like Q-learning.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop to iteratively train the agent, collecting data and updating its policy.  Visualize the training process (e.g., plot rewards over time).
4. **Integration:** Integrate the trained agent into the game, allowing it to play autonomously.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance by observing its gameplay and analyzing its success rate.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward system that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging.  Experimentation with different reward structures may be necessary.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the right hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) requires experimentation and may impact training speed and performance.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of Reinforcement Learning algorithms and their implementation.
- Understanding the key components of an RL system: environment, agent, reward, policy.
- Experience with game development using a simple framework like Pygame.
