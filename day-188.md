# Mini-Game AI Opponent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The focus is on creating a functional, albeit rudimentary, RL agent within a short timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts.  This allows for rapid iteration and experimentation with different RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for RL implementation)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A suitable game environment library (e.g., a custom-built one for simplicity, or a pre-existing library if time allows).

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) with a human-playable interface.
    - An RL agent capable of learning through self-play.
    - A basic RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simplified version of SARSA).
    - Tracking of agent's win rate and performance metrics.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Integration with a graphical user interface (GUI) library like Pygame.
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Create a basic implementation of the chosen game (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).  This should include functions for making moves, checking for wins/draws, and rendering the game state.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity). Implement the core components: state representation, action space, Q-table (or neural network for DQN), and the learning loop.
3. **Training Loop:** Design a training loop that involves self-play between the RL agent and a copy of itself (or a random agent initially).  The agent should learn from the outcomes of its games.
4. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance against a human player or a stronger opponent (e.g., a minimax agent for Tic-Tac-Toe).
5. **Performance Analysis:** Analyze the agent's win rate and other metrics to assess its learning progress.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining an effective reward function is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior. Experimentation and adjustments are likely needed.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions that have proven successful) is a key challenge in RL.  This often requires careful tuning of parameters within the chosen algorithm.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with core RL concepts like states, actions, rewards, Q-values, and the learning process.
- **Agent Development:** Learn how to design, implement, and evaluate a simple RL agent within a constrained environment.
