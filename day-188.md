# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The goal is to create a functional prototype showcasing the core concepts of RL in a short timeframe. This project's significance lies in its ability to demonstrate the power of RL in creating adaptive and challenging AI opponents within a constrained environment.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning)
- **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm), Python environment (Anaconda recommended).


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Mechanics:**  A simple game like Pong or a simplified version of Snake with clear win/loss conditions.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An AI opponent that learns through trial and error using a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
- **Game Visualization:** Real-time rendering of the game state using Pygame.
- **Training & Evaluation:** A mechanism to train the AI agent and evaluate its performance against a simple rule-based AI or human player.
- **Score Tracking:**  Keeping track of the AI's score over training episodes.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network – DQN), adding different difficulty levels.
- **Optional Feature:** Implementing a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for training parameters adjustments.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create the basic game structure and mechanics using Pygame. Focus on simplicity and clarity.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point) and implement it to control the AI opponent.
3. **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop that allows the AI agent to play multiple games, learn from its experiences, and update its policy.
4. **Evaluation:**  Create a function to evaluate the AI agent's performance against a baseline (e.g., random actions or a simple rule-based opponent).
5. **Visualization & Refinement:** Integrate the RL agent into the game and refine the training process based on the agent's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) for the RL algorithm might require experimentation. This can be mitigated by starting with commonly used values and iteratively adjusting them based on performance.
- **Reward Function Design:**  Designing a suitable reward function that accurately reflects the desired behavior of the AI agent is crucial. Incorrectly designed reward functions may lead to unexpected behavior. This can be addressed by considering different reward function design options and monitoring the AI’s behavior during training.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and applying a fundamental RL algorithm.
- **Game Development with Pygame:**  Participants gain experience in using Pygame for creating simple 2D games and integrating AI components.
