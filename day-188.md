# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to build a rudimentary AI that can learn optimal strategies through trial and error within a short timeframe. This provides a practical application of reinforcement learning concepts in a controlled and manageable environment.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `gym` (for environment creation, optional but recommended), `numpy`, a reinforcement learning library (e.g., `stable-baselines3`, `tf-agents`).

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  Implement a functional Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four game environment with a clear win/loss/draw condition.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Train a simple reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning or a policy gradient method) to play the game.
- **Training Loop:** Design a training loop that allows the AI to play against itself or a random opponent, learning optimal strategies over multiple games.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Measure the agent's win rate against a random opponent.
- **User Interface (Optional):** A basic text-based interface to allow human interaction with the AI.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement exploration strategies (e.g., Îµ-greedy) to improve learning and avoid getting stuck in local optima.
- **Advanced Features:**  Visualize the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting win rate over time).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment using Python and chosen libraries. Define state representation, actions, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on its learned policy.
3. **Training Loop:** Design and implement a training loop where the agent plays numerous games against itself (or a random opponent) and updates its policy based on the received rewards.
4. **Evaluation:**  Test the trained agent against a random opponent to assess its performance (win rate).
5. **Optional UI (If time allows):** Develop a minimal text-based user interface for interacting with the trained AI.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for guiding the agent towards optimal behavior. A poorly designed reward function might lead to unexpected or suboptimal strategies.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, exploration rate) might require some experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms.
- Experience with implementing a game AI agent and understanding its learning process.
- Developing skills in designing reward functions and evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning agents.
