# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home appliance control system using a combination of voice recognition and hand gesture detection.  The system will allow users to control a simulated appliance (e.g., a lamp, fan) through simple voice commands and gestures, demonstrating a multimodal interaction approach.  The significance lies in exploring the integration of different input modalities for a more intuitive and accessible smart home experience.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `SpeechRecognition` (for voice recognition), `MediaPipe` (for hand gesture recognition), `Pygame` (for simple GUI simulation, optional),  `RPi.GPIO` (if controlling a real appliance via Raspberry Pi)
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi, compatible hardware for appliance control (e.g., relays) , Webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to basic voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Increase brightness."
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., open palm for "on," closed fist for "off") to control the simulated appliance.
- **Appliance Simulation:** A simple visual representation of the appliance state (on/off, brightness level) will be displayed.
- **Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle incorrect voice commands or unrecognized gestures.
- **Multimodal Integration:**  Both voice and gesture inputs should be processed and used to control the appliance.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a real appliance via Raspberry Pi and GPIO.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Adding a small GUI with visual feedback of gesture recognition confidence scores.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install SpeechRecognition mediapipe pygame`) and set up your development environment. If using Raspberry Pi, configure the GPIO pins.
2. **Voice Recognition Module:** Implement the voice recognition using `SpeechRecognition`, focusing on accurate transcription of basic commands.
3. **Gesture Recognition Module:** Use `MediaPipe` to detect hand gestures from a webcam feed.  Focus on implementing 2-3 distinct gestures.
4. **Appliance Simulation & Control Logic:** Create a simple simulated appliance and integrate the voice and gesture recognition modules to control its state (on/off, brightness).
5. **GUI (Optional):**  If desired, create a simple Pygame interface to visualize the appliance state and provide visual feedback of recognized commands/gestures.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:**  Dealing with background noise or variations in voice can affect the accuracy of voice commands. Consider adding some basic noise reduction techniques or error handling.
- **Gesture Recognition Robustness:**  Hand gestures may be affected by lighting conditions or hand positioning.  Experiment with different gesture recognition parameters to improve robustness.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Interaction Design:**  Gain experience in designing and implementing systems that integrate multiple input modalities.
- **Real-time Processing:**  This project reinforces skills in real-time processing of audio and video streams using Python libraries.
