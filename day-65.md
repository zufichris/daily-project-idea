# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic mini-game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be designed for rapid iteration and will allow exploration of different reinforcement learning algorithms within a constrained timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL and its potential for rapid prototyping.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 or RLlib
* **Game Engine (optional but recommended):** Pygame for simple 2D game development.  Alternatively, a text-based game can be implemented.
* **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple, deterministic game environment (e.g., a grid-based game with a single agent and a goal).
    - An AI agent utilizing a chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
    - Training the agent to achieve the goal within the game.
    - Basic visualization of the agent's progress (e.g., displaying the game state and agent's actions).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., switching from Q-learning to PPO).
    - Adding a simple reward shaping mechanism to improve learning efficiency.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Design & Implementation:**  Design a simple game environment. If using Pygame, create the game window, define game mechanics, and implement basic rendering. A text-based game can also be implemented quickly for simplicity.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm and integrate it with the game environment using Stable Baselines3 or RLlib. Define the agent's observation space (game state) and action space (possible movements).
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that allows the agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy based on the chosen algorithm.
4. **Visualization and Evaluation:** Implement basic visualization of the agent's progress and the game state.  Evaluate the agent's performance by measuring its success rate in achieving the game's goal.
5. **Refinement (Time Permitting):** Experiment with different hyperparameters or algorithms to improve the agent's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing the appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm for the game's complexity and time constraints.  Simple algorithms like Q-learning are easier to implement quickly, while more advanced algorithms like PPO might require more time for tuning and understanding.
- **Reward Function Design:**  Defining an effective reward function that guides the agent's learning efficiently. An poorly designed reward function might lead to unintended behaviors.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Hands-on experience with applying reinforcement learning algorithms to a practical problem.
- **Rapid Prototyping:**  Developing the ability to quickly iterate on a software project within a short time frame.
