# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be a minimal text-based environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different reinforcement learning algorithms. The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL within a constrained timeframe, highlighting core concepts without extensive overhead.


## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Reinforcement Learning Library: PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (with RL extensions)
- Game Engine (optional but recommended for visualization): Pygame


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple text-based game environment (e.g., a grid-based maze navigation).
    - An AI agent that uses a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
    - A reward system to guide the agent's learning (e.g., rewards for reaching the goal, penalties for hitting obstacles).
    - Training loop with visualization of the agent's progress.
    - Basic data logging to track performance metrics (e.g., number of steps to reach the goal, total reward).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Integration with a GUI (Pygame) for visual feedback during training.
    - Experimentation with different hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) to optimize the agent's performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game rules, reward structure, and state representation.  Create the game environment in Python. This could be as simple as a list of lists representing a grid.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement the chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning or SARSA). Define the agent's actions, state space, and Q-table (or equivalent).
3. **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop that iteratively updates the agent's policy based on the interaction with the environment.  Incorporate data logging to track performance.
4. **Visualization (Optional):** Integrate a simple visualization using Pygame to display the agent's actions and progress within the game environment.
5. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent's performance by letting it play the game without further training.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the reinforcement learning algorithm can be challenging and may require experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust incrementally.
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward system that guides the agent towards the desired behavior without being too sparse or too dense can be tricky.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces the core concepts of reinforcement learning, including state-action spaces, rewards, policies, and different algorithms (Q-learning or SARSA).
- **Agent-Environment Interaction:**  Understanding how an agent interacts with its environment and learns from its experiences is crucial. This project provides hands-on practice in designing and implementing such interactions.
