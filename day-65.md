# Optimized Robot Arm Trajectory Planning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified trajectory planner for a robotic arm, focusing on optimization for speed and smoothness while avoiding obstacles.  This is a crucial component in many robotic applications and a good exercise in applying optimization algorithms within a constrained environment.  The focus will be on a 2D planar arm for simplicity, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (optimize), Matplotlib
* **Optional:** Pygame for visualization (optional, but highly recommended)

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Trajectory Generation:**  Generate a smooth trajectory between two points in a 2D plane for a single-joint robotic arm.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implement a simple obstacle avoidance algorithm (e.g., a potential field method) to modify the trajectory and avoid collisions.
- **Trajectory Optimization:**  Optimize the trajectory to minimize the total travel time or the jerk (rate of change of acceleration) using SciPy's optimization functions.
- **Visualization:** (Optional) Display the robot arm's movement and the generated trajectory using Pygame.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display key metrics such as total travel time and maximum acceleration/jerk.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Basic Trajectory:** Define the robot arm's kinematics (simple 2D case) and implement a basic linear interpolation trajectory between two points.
2. **Obstacle Representation:** Define a simple obstacle representation (e.g., circles or polygons) in the 2D plane.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance Implementation:** Implement a potential field or similar algorithm to modify the trajectory based on the proximity to obstacles.
4. **Trajectory Optimization:** Use SciPy's optimization functions (e.g., `minimize`) to optimize the trajectory, minimizing travel time or jerk, subject to obstacle avoidance constraints.
5. **Visualization and Evaluation:** (Optional) Visualize the trajectory using Pygame and calculate/display performance metrics.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Optimization Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate optimization algorithm and setting its parameters effectively is crucial for achieving good results within the time constraint. Experimentation may be needed.
- **Obstacle Representation Complexity:**  Balancing simplicity (for rapid prototyping) with the realism of obstacle representation can be challenging.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Optimization Techniques:** This project provides practical experience in applying optimization algorithms to solve a real-world engineering problem.
- **Understanding of Robot Kinematics and Trajectory Planning:** This project strengthens understanding of basic robotic concepts and the challenges involved in generating efficient and safe trajectories.
