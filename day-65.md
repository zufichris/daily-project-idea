# Self-Healing Robotic Arm Path Planning with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic simulation of a robotic arm that utilizes reinforcement learning to adapt its path planning in response to unforeseen obstacles. The significance lies in showcasing a simplified, yet powerful, application of RL in robotics, specifically addressing the self-healing aspect crucial for robust robotic systems.  The focus will be on creating a functional prototype within a limited timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
* **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Arm Simulation:**  A 2-degree-of-freedom robotic arm simulated in a 2D environment with a simple graphical representation using Pygame.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The arm should be able to navigate around randomly placed static obstacles during its movement from a start to a goal point.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An agent trained using a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to learn optimal paths while avoiding collisions.
- **Reward Function:** A reward function that incentivizes reaching the goal and penalizes collisions.
- **Path Visualization:** Pygame will visualize the robot arm's movement, obstacles, and the path it takes.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Dynamic obstacles (moving obstacles),  more complex arm kinematics (more degrees of freedom).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Different RL algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Network).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the Pygame environment, define the robot arm's kinematics, and implement obstacle generation.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent with a suitable state and action space. Design the reward function.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop to repeatedly simulate the arm's movement, gather rewards, and update the Q-table.
4. **Path Planning:** Integrate the trained agent to plan the path from a start to a goal point, considering obstacles.
5. **Visualization:** Use Pygame to visualize the arm's movement, obstacles, and the planned path.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:** Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting already learned knowledge is crucial for efficient learning within the limited time frame.  Careful tuning of exploration parameters might be needed.
- **Computational Cost:** Training a reinforcement learning agent can be computationally expensive. Simplifying the environment and using a less computationally demanding RL algorithm can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces the core concepts of reinforcement learning, including state, action, reward, and the Q-learning algorithm.
- **Robotics Simulation:**  Practical experience in building a simple robotics simulation and integrating a learning agent into it, highlighting the challenges and techniques involved.
