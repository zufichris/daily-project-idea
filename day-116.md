# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a 2D game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be a minimalistic environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different RL algorithms.  The significance lies in applying core RL concepts to a tangible problem, providing a hands-on experience with building and training an intelligent agent.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3
- **Game Engine:** Pygame (for simplicity)
- **Other Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization and data analysis)

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Environment:** A simple 2D grid-based environment with obstacles and a goal. The agent (AI) needs to navigate to the goal.
- **Reward System:** A reward mechanism that incentivizes the agent to reach the goal quickly and efficiently, penalizing collisions with obstacles.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Implementation of a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) to train the agent.
- **Training and Evaluation:**  The agent should be trained for a set number of episodes, and its performance (success rate, average steps to goal) should be evaluated.
- **Data Visualization:**  Plotting relevant metrics (reward, success rate) during training to monitor progress.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Adding more complex game mechanics (e.g., moving obstacles, multiple goals).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN) for comparison.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Create the basic game environment using Pygame, defining the game state, reward function, and actions.
2. **Implement the RL Agent:** Choose an RL algorithm (PPO is recommended for ease of use) from Stable Baselines3 and integrate it with the game environment.
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the training loop, accumulating experience and updating the agent's policy. Monitor performance using Matplotlib.
4. **Evaluate the Agent:** Test the trained agent in the game environment and analyze its performance using relevant metrics.
5. **Refine and Iterate:** Adjust hyperparameters, game mechanics, or the RL algorithm based on the evaluation results to improve the agent's performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm can be challenging and might require experimentation.  Start with default values and gradually adjust.
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent towards desired behavior is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or unexpected behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:**  Hands-on experience with implementing and applying a core RL algorithm.
- **Agent-Environment Interaction:**  Understanding the dynamics of agent-environment interaction in the context of RL.
