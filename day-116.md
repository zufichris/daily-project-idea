# Minimalist Robotic Arm Path Planning with Collision Avoidance

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified path planning algorithm for a robotic arm, incorporating basic collision avoidance.  The goal is to create a functional prototype that can plan a collision-free path between two specified points in a simulated 2D environment.  This is a scaled-down version of a complex problem, making it feasible for a two-day challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), a simple robotic arm simulation library (e.g., a custom one or a simplified version of an existing library).

## Features & Requirements

- **Path Generation:** The algorithm should generate a collision-free path between a start and end point for a simulated 2D robotic arm with a single joint.
- **Collision Detection:** Basic collision detection with static obstacles (represented as simple shapes like circles or rectangles) should be implemented.
- **Visualization:** The path, arm movements, and obstacles should be visually represented using Pygame.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a basic smoothing algorithm (e.g., simple averaging) to reduce the number of path points.
- **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:** Use a simple strategy like potential fields or a basic A* search algorithm to find a path around obstacles.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries (Pygame, NumPy), and create a basic Pygame window for visualization.  Define a simple robotic arm model (position, joint angle, etc.).
2. **Obstacle Definition and Visualization:** Define the location and shape of obstacles in the 2D environment and render them in the Pygame window.
3. **Basic Path Planning:** Implement a simple path planning algorithm (e.g., straight line or a very rudimentary A*).  Add collision detection to stop the arm if it collides with an obstacle.
4. **Collision Avoidance:** Incorporate a rudimentary obstacle avoidance strategy (e.g., a simple repulsive force from obstacles).
5. **Path Visualization and Refinement:** Visualize the planned path and the arm's movement in the Pygame window. Iterate on the path planning and obstacle avoidance logic to improve performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:** Balancing algorithm complexity against the timeframe is crucial.  A simple, yet effective, approach is key.  Overly ambitious algorithms may not be feasible within the time constraint.
- **Collision Detection Efficiency:**  Ensure the collision detection mechanism doesn't introduce significant performance bottlenecks. Simple bounding box checks are sufficient for the scope of this project.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Path Planning Concepts:**  This project provides hands-on experience with fundamental path planning algorithms, including collision avoidance techniques.
- **Practical Application of Visualization Tools:** This project enhances proficiency in using Pygame or similar libraries for visualizing algorithms and robotics simulations.
