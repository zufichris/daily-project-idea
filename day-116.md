# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Robotic Arm Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple system for controlling a robotic arm using micro-gestures captured via a webcam.  The focus is on real-time recognition of a limited set of gestures, translating them into specific robotic arm movements. This demonstrates fundamental concepts in computer vision and robotics control within a constrained timeframe.  The significance lies in exploring the potential of intuitive human-robot interaction using readily available technology.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, PySerial (for serial communication with the robotic arm, if applicable)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, Robotic Arm (optional, can be simulated),  Computer with sufficient processing power.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:** Real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Classification:** Recognition of 3-4 pre-defined gestures (e.g., open hand, fist, point up, point down).
- **Arm Control Mapping:** Mapping recognized gestures to specific robotic arm movements (e.g., open hand = grip release, fist = grip close).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display recognized gestures and corresponding arm actions on the screen.
- **Calibration:** Ability to calibrate gesture recognition and arm movement mappings.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporating more complex gestures (e.g., rotations).
- **Optional Feature:** Using a more sophisticated robotic arm control library/interface beyond basic serial communication.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PySerial if using a physical arm).  Import libraries and set up webcam access.
2. **Gesture Detection & Classification:** Implement MediaPipe hand detection and create a simple classifier to distinguish the chosen gestures. This could involve using pre-trained models or creating a basic custom classifier based on hand landmark coordinates.
3. **Control Mapping & Execution:**  Map classified gestures to commands for the robotic arm (simulated or real).  If using a real arm, configure serial communication.
4. **Real-time Feedback Implementation:** Display a live video feed with gesture overlays and arm status (position, grip).
5. **Testing and Calibration:** Test the system with various gestures and fine-tune gesture recognition and control mappings.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  MediaPipe's accuracy might vary depending on lighting and hand positioning. Robustness against variations needs to be considered.
- **Robotic Arm Control Complexity:**  If using a real robotic arm, understanding and correctly implementing the control interface can be challenging.  A simulator might be a more practical initial step.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Implementing real-time object detection and basic image processing.
- **Human-Robot Interaction:**  Understanding the challenges and opportunities in designing intuitive interfaces for robotic control.
