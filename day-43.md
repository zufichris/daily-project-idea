# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for a Smart Home Device

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a tinyML-based gesture recognition system that can control a smart home device (e.g., a smart lamp) using a microcontroller and an onboard accelerometer.  The goal is to create a lightweight, energy-efficient, and locally processed solution, eliminating the need for cloud connectivity for basic functionalities.  This is significant as it improves privacy and reduces latency.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** MicroPython (for ease of development and deployment on microcontrollers)
* **Hardware:** ESP32 microcontroller development board (with integrated accelerometer), breadboard, jumper wires, optional LED or relay module for output control.
* **Libraries:**  MicroPython libraries for accelerometer reading and machine learning (e.g., TinyML models or a simplified custom algorithm).
* **Tools:** Arduino IDE or Thonny IDE for MicroPython development.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  Accurately capture accelerometer data representing predefined gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, rotating wrist for dimming).
- **Gesture Classification:** Implement a simple machine learning model (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors) or a rule-based system to classify captured gestures.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Control an external device (LED or relay) based on classified gestures.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Option to log accelerometer data for training and model improvement.
- **Real-time Feedback (Optional):**  Visual or audible feedback on successful gesture recognition.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Connect the ESP32, set up the development environment, and write code to read accelerometer data.  Record multiple samples of each predefined gesture.
2. **Gesture Classification Algorithm:** Implement a simple KNN algorithm or a rule-based classifier based on the acquired data. This might involve feature extraction (e.g., calculating magnitude of acceleration).
3. **Integration with Output Device:**  Connect an LED or a relay module and write code to control it based on the output of the classifier.
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different users and gestures. Refine the model/rules based on the results.
5. **Calibration (Optional):**  Implement a calibration routine to adjust the sensitivity and threshold for improved accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Noise in Sensor Data:** Accelerometer data can be noisy, requiring appropriate filtering or smoothing techniques.
- **Gesture Variability:**  Developing a robust model that accounts for variations in gesture execution across different users.  A simple model might only capture basic gestures reliably.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of basic machine learning concepts (e.g., feature extraction, classification).
- Practical experience in embedded systems programming and sensor integration.
