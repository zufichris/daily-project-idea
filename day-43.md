# Mini-Project:  Smart Home Device Control via Hand Gestures

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling a smart home device (e.g., a smart light) using real-time hand gesture recognition.  This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and machine learning in a limited timeframe, focusing on a simplified yet functional system. The significance lies in exploring accessible and intuitive human-computer interaction methods for smart home applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  a suitable smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API)
* **Hardware:**  A webcam (built-in or external) and a smart home device (e.g., a Philips Hue light bulb).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately detect and classify a small set of pre-defined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for ON, closed fist for OFF, thumbs up for brightness increase).
- **Smart Home Device Control:**  The recognized gestures should trigger corresponding actions on a chosen smart home device.
- **User Interface:** A simple visual feedback mechanism (e.g., displaying the recognized gesture on screen) to enhance user experience.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for gesture recognition failures or communication issues with the smart home device.
- **Calibration:**  A simple calibration procedure to adapt the hand gesture recognition to different lighting conditions and user hand sizes.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Device Control:** Extend the system to control multiple smart home devices with different gestures.
- **Gesture Customization:** Allow users to define their custom gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe), and ensure connection to the smart home API.
2. **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe and define a simple gesture classification algorithm based on landmark positions.  Focus on 2-3 basic gestures initially.
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Integrate the gesture recognition with the chosen smart home API to send commands based on recognized gestures.
4. **User Interface Development:** Create a basic visual display (e.g., using OpenCV's windowing functionality) showing the recognized gesture and the device status.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and user variations.  Refine the gesture recognition and calibration as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy in real-time, especially with variations in hand size, lighting, and background clutter, might require careful parameter tuning or more advanced techniques.
- **Smart Home API Integration:**  The complexity of this step depends on the chosen API.  Thorough documentation review and potentially some debugging will be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of computer vision:**  Hands-on experience with real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Experience with Smart Home APIs:**  Understanding and utilizing the API for controlling smart devices.
