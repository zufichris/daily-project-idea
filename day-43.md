# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured using a standard webcam. The system will recognize simple hand gestures, translating them into commands for controlling smart home devices (e.g., lights, music).  The significance lies in creating a more intuitive and contactless interaction method compared to traditional voice or touch interfaces.  This project focuses on building a functional prototype, rather than a fully polished product.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), PyAutoGUI (GUI automation)
* **Tools:**  A laptop with a webcam, a virtual environment (e.g., conda or venv).  Consider using a pre-trained model for faster development.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  The system should reliably recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., swipe left/right for volume control, hand wave for lights on/off).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Gestures should be detected and translated into commands with minimal latency.
- **Device Control:** The system should interface with at least one simulated smart home device (e.g., using a simple web server to simulate light/music control).
- **User Calibration:**  Allow for a quick calibration step to adjust the system to the user's unique hand size and gestures.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display a visual representation of the recognized gesture and the corresponding action taken.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- Integration with a real smart home system (e.g., Home Assistant, Philips Hue).
- More sophisticated gesture recognition using a machine learning model trained on custom gesture data.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Set up the development environment, install necessary libraries, and capture a small dataset of sample gestures for training (if not using a pre-trained model).
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement real-time hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe.  Process the hand keypoint data to extract relevant features for gesture classification.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Use a simple classifier (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors or a pre-trained model) to classify the extracted features into predefined gestures.
4. **Control Implementation:**  Develop the interface to send commands to the simulated (or real) smart home devices based on the classified gestures.
5. **User Interface:** Create a basic visual interface to display the recognized gesture and the current status of the controlled devices.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand positioning, and background clutter can be challenging for reliable gesture recognition.  Pre-processing techniques and more advanced machine learning models might be necessary.
- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in real-time might require careful selection and tuning of the classification algorithm and potentially retraining with a larger dataset.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce practical application of computer vision techniques, especially real-time video processing and hand gesture recognition.
- Gain experience in integrating different libraries and tools for a complete system development.
