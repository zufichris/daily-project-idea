# Mini-Game AI for Existing Game Engine

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for an existing game engine (e.g., Unity, Godot) using a lightweight machine learning approach.  The goal is to implement a basic AI capable of playing a simplified version of a classic game (like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) within a day or two.  This avoids the complexities of integrating with a fully-fledged game, allowing focus on the AI implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with a suitable game engine integration library)
- **Game Engine:** Unity (or Godot - choose one based on familiarity)
- **Machine Learning Library:**  A lightweight library like PyTorch or a simpler approach using decision trees/rule-based systems.
- **Other Tools:** A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm), Git for version control.


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Implementation:**  A functional, playable version of a simplified game (e.g., 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe).
- **AI Opponent:**  An AI that can make moves against a human player.
- **Win/Loss Detection:**  Accurate detection of win/loss conditions for both players.
- **User Interface:**  A simple, functional interface for human interaction.
- **Game State Representation:** A clean and efficient way to represent the game board in code.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard),  AI learning through a basic reinforcement learning approach.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Set up the chosen game engine and create a basic representation of the game board and game rules. Implement win/loss detection.
2. **AI Algorithm Implementation:** Choose a suitable AI algorithm (e.g., Minimax for Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple rule-based system for a more complex game). Implement the chosen algorithm and integrate it with the game engine.
3. **User Interface Integration:** Create a basic user interface to allow a human player to interact with the game and the AI.
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the AI against human players and refine the algorithm or rules as necessary.
5. **Optional: Advanced Features:** If time allows, implement optional features like difficulty levels or a rudimentary learning mechanism.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Choosing an appropriate algorithm that balances complexity with the time constraint.  A simple approach might be necessary for a larger game.
- **Game Engine Integration:**  Successfully integrating the AI logic with the chosen game engineâ€™s event handling and rendering systems.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of AI concepts:**  Hands-on experience in implementing a game-playing AI using a chosen algorithm.
- **Game engine familiarity:** Strengthened understanding of game development principles and practical experience with a specific game engine.
