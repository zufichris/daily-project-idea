# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts, not on creating a polished, complex game. The significance lies in understanding the fundamentals of RL through practical application within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL agent)
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple Game Environment:** A 2D game with a clear objective (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items).
- **RL Agent Implementation:** A basic Q-learning or SARSA agent to learn optimal actions.
- **Reward System:** Define a clear reward structure to guide the agent's learning.
- **Training and Evaluation:**  Train the agent for a limited number of episodes and evaluate its performance.
- **Visualization:** Basic visualization of the game and the agent's actions.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple neural network as the function approximator in the RL agent.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Introduce a slightly more complex game environment (e.g., multiple agents or dynamic obstacles).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Design and implement the core game logic and rendering using Pygame.  Keep it extremely simple (e.g., a grid-based maze).
2. **Agent Design:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity) and design the state and action spaces for the agent.
3. **Reward Function:** Define a reward function that appropriately incentivizes the agent to achieve the game's objective.
4. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop to run the agent in the environment, updating its Q-values based on the chosen RL algorithm.
5. **Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluate the agent's performance after training by running it through the game and visualizing its actions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior without oversimplifying the problem or leading to unintended consequences.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) for the RL algorithm might require some experimentation within the limited timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts such as Q-learning, state-action spaces, reward functions, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
- **Game Development with Pygame:** The project provides hands-on experience with basic game development using Pygame, improving skills in creating interactive applications.
