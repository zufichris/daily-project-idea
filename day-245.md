# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game, like Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Connect Four, using reinforcement learning. The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstration of core RL concepts within a short timeframe.  The projectâ€™s significance lies in showcasing the power of reinforcement learning in a concise and easily understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `gym` (for environment creation, optional), `numpy`, a reinforcement learning library (e.g., `stable-baselines3`, `rllib`).


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or simplified Connect Four).
    - An AI agent using a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
    - Training the AI agent through self-play.
    - Evaluation of the AI agent's performance against a random agent.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Visualization of the learning process (e.g., plotting rewards over time).
    - Implementation of a more advanced RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN) if time permits).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game rules and create the game environment. This can be a simple function-based implementation or leverage the `gym` library for a more structured approach.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on its learned Q-values.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop where the agent plays against itself repeatedly, updating its Q-values based on the rewards received.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a random or a simple rule-based opponent.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If time allows, create a simple visualization to show the agent's learning curve or game play.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the AI towards optimal play is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or unexpected behavior.
- **Computational Cost:** Depending on the chosen algorithm and the complexity of the game, training might require significant computation time.  Simpler algorithms and smaller state spaces should be prioritized for a one-day project.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of a reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Understanding of the key components of a reinforcement learning system (agent, environment, reward function).
- Experience in rapidly prototyping and evaluating a machine learning model.
