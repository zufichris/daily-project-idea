# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and readily available machine learning models. The significance lies in its potential applications in various domains, including robotics, security, and automation, demonstrating the integration of embedded systems with computer vision.  This daily challenge focuses on rapid prototyping and efficient model deployment.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model with camera support), USB camera.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite or a similar lightweight ML framework (e.g., PyTorch Mobile), potentially a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub or a similar repository.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Capture:**  Capture video from the connected camera.
- **Object Detection:** Detect and highlight objects within the video stream using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the identified objects across frames using a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking).
- **Classification (Optional):**  Classify detected objects into predefined categories if a classification model is integrated.
- **Output Display:** Display the video stream with bounding boxes around detected objects and potentially classification labels.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Configuration:** Install necessary Python packages (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite). Configure the Raspberry Pi camera.  Download a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Video Capture and Object Detection:** Write a Python script to capture video from the camera and integrate the chosen object detection model using OpenCV.
3. **Object Tracking Implementation:** Implement a basic object tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow detected objects across frames.
4. **Output and Visualization:** Display the processed video stream with bounding boxes and labels. Optimize for performance on the Raspberry Pi.
5. **(Optional) Classification Integration:** If using a classification model, integrate it into the pipeline after object detection.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's limited processing power might necessitate using lightweight, optimized machine learning models.  Careful consideration of model selection and optimization techniques is crucial.
- **Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-off:** Balancing the accuracy of object detection and tracking with the real-time processing requirements of the system. Experimentation with different model parameters and tracking algorithms may be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with real-time computer vision processing on an embedded system.
- Practical application of lightweight machine learning models for efficient object detection and tracking.  Understanding the limitations of resource-constrained environments and techniques to mitigate them.
