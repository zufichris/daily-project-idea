# Self-Balancing Robot Simulation

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simplified simulation of a self-balancing two-wheeled robot (like a Segway) using Python and a physics engine. The simulation will visually represent the robot's dynamics and allow for experimentation with different control algorithms. This project emphasizes understanding control systems and real-time simulations, crucial aspects of robotics and autonomous systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Physics Engine:** Pygame (for simplicity and rapid prototyping) or Pymunk (for more advanced physics)
* **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm
* **Libraries:**  NumPy (for numerical computation), potentially Matplotlib (for data visualization).


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Physics Simulation:**  The robot should accurately simulate gravity, inertia, and wheel torque.
- **Balance Control:** Implement a simple Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain balance.  The robot should stay upright without falling over.
- **Visual Representation:** Display the robot's position, angle, and wheel speeds graphically using Pygame.
- **User Interaction (Optional):** Allow the user to apply external forces (e.g., simulated wind) to the robot.
- **Sensor Simulation:** Simulate a simple accelerometer and gyroscope providing data to the controller.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create a basic Pygame window and draw the robot as a simple shape.
2. **Physics Integration:** Implement basic physics calculations (e.g., using Euler integration or a slightly more advanced method). Update the robot's position and angle based on wheel speeds and gravity.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller that takes sensor readings (simulated) and adjusts wheel speeds to maintain balance.  Start with a simple proportional controller and gradually add integral and derivative terms.
4. **Visual Feedback:** Update the robot's position on the screen in real-time based on the physics simulation and controller outputs.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the simulation with different PID gains and observe the robot's stability. Refine the controller parameters to achieve optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Controller Tuning:**  Finding appropriate PID gains for stable balancing can be challenging and requires iterative adjustment.
- **Numerical Stability:** Using simple integration methods can lead to numerical instability; more sophisticated methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta) might be necessary for accurate and stable simulations.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID Control:** Understand the implementation and tuning of a PID controller, a fundamental control algorithm in robotics.
- **Experience with Physics Simulations:**  Gain practical experience in creating and working with a simplified physics simulation using a game engine and numerical methods.
