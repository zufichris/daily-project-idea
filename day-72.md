# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified intelligent traffic light system using a chosen algorithm to optimize traffic flow based on simulated vehicle density. The goal is to create a functional simulation that can be visually represented and adjusted to test different traffic management strategies. This project focuses on algorithm implementation and visualization, not on real-world hardware integration.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), potentially Matplotlib (for advanced data visualization).


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Simulation:**  Simulate vehicles moving along defined roads, with random vehicle generation rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a traffic light control algorithm (e.g., a simple timer-based system, or a more advanced adaptive control algorithm).
- **Density Sensing:** Simulate vehicle density sensors at intersections to inform the traffic light control algorithm.
- **Visualization:**  Display the simulation visually using Pygame, showing vehicles, traffic lights, and possibly density indicators.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track average waiting time, throughput, and other relevant metrics to evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated adaptive traffic control algorithm (e.g., using reinforcement learning).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate different road types (e.g., one-way streets) and intersection configurations.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Structure:** Set up the Pygame window and define the road network and traffic light positions.
2. **Vehicle Simulation:** Implement vehicle generation, movement, and collision detection.
3. **Simple Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic timer-based traffic light switching mechanism.
4. **Density Sensing:** Implement simulated density sensors to gather information about vehicle counts.
5. **Visualization Enhancement:** Add visuals to show traffic light states, vehicle density, and performance metrics.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Choosing and implementing an effective traffic control algorithm within the time constraint requires careful planning and prioritization. A simple timer-based system could be implemented first, with more sophisticated algorithms added later.
- **Visualization Performance:**  Managing the visualization of many vehicles while maintaining a smooth frame rate might require optimization techniques (e.g., using sprites efficiently).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithm Design and Implementation:** This project reinforces the process of designing, implementing, and testing algorithms for a real-world problem.
- **Software Visualization:**  This project improves skills in creating visual representations of data and simulations using a library like Pygame.
