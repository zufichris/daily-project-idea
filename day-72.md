# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a gesture-based smart home control system using a low-power microcontroller and a TinyML approach. The system will recognize a limited set of hand gestures captured by an onboard sensor (e.g., accelerometer or a simple camera module) and trigger corresponding actions within a simulated smart home environment.  This project highlights the potential of edge computing and its applications in resource-constrained environments.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** MicroPython (for ease of rapid prototyping on microcontrollers) or Arduino C++
* **Hardware:** ESP32 microcontroller development board (with built-in WiFi and sufficient processing power), optional: small camera module (OV7670 or similar).
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow Lite Micro (for model inference),  relevant libraries for sensor interfacing (depending on the chosen sensor).
* **Tools:** Arduino IDE or Thonny IDE (for MicroPython),  TensorFlow Lite Model Maker (for model training - might require pre-trained models for a truly one-day challenge).

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Acquisition:** Capture accelerometer data (or image data if using a camera) representing different hand gestures (e.g., wave for lights on/off, fist for volume up/down).
- **Model Inference:** Implement a TinyML model on the ESP32 to classify captured data into predefined gestures.
- **Action Triggering:** Trigger simulated smart home actions (e.g., print to console "Lights ON," "Volume Increased") based on gesture classification.
- **Real-time Processing:** Process data and trigger actions with minimal latency.
- **User Calibration (optional):** Allow for user-specific gesture calibration to improve accuracy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect training data for the chosen gestures using the sensor.  Preprocess the data (e.g., filtering, normalization).
2. **Model Training (if not using pre-trained):** Use TensorFlow Lite Model Maker or a similar tool to train a suitable model (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors or a simple CNN if using image data) using the preprocessed data. Convert the trained model to a TensorFlow Lite Micro format compatible with the ESP32.
3. **ESP32 Implementation:** Integrate the TensorFlow Lite Micro model into the ESP32 firmware. Implement the gesture acquisition logic and interface with the chosen sensor.
4. **Action Triggering Logic:** Implement the logic to map classified gestures to simulated smart home actions.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the model or preprocessing steps as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy with limited training data and low processing power is a challenge.  Using a pre-trained model and transfer learning could significantly reduce the training time.
- **Real-time Constraints:** Ensuring real-time performance on a resource-constrained microcontroller requires careful optimization of the model and code.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with TinyML:** Gain hands-on experience in developing and deploying a TinyML model on a microcontroller.
- **Edge Computing and Resource Management:** Understand the challenges and techniques involved in developing efficient applications for resource-constrained devices.
