# Mini-Game AI for a Simple Physics Engine

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic AI agent capable of learning to play a simple physics-based mini-game using reinforcement learning. The game will involve manipulating objects within a simulated environment to achieve a specific objective. This is a challenging yet achievable task for a 1-2 day project, focusing on core reinforcement learning concepts and efficient prototyping.


## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Reinforcement Learning Library: PyTorch or Stable Baselines3
- Physics Engine: Pymunk (2D) or PyBullet (3D â€“ more challenging)
- Game Development Library (optional, for better visualization): Pygame


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple physics-based game environment (e.g., balancing blocks, navigating a maze).
    - A basic AI agent using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
    - Training the AI agent to achieve the game objective.
    - Visualization of the game and agent's actions.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Adding a GUI for improved user interaction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Choose a physics engine and implement the game mechanics (create game objects, define rules, reward system).
2. **Design the AI agent:** Select a reinforcement learning algorithm and implement the agent's decision-making process. Focus on a simpler algorithm initially (e.g., Q-learning).
3. **Train the agent:** Run training sessions, observing the agent's performance and tweaking hyperparameters as needed.
4. **Evaluate and refine:** Evaluate the agent's performance by running test episodes and adjusting the reward function or algorithm parameters if necessary.
5. **Optional: Add visualization:** If time permits, create a basic visual representation of the game and the agent's actions using Pygame.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward function design:**  Defining an effective reward function that guides the agent towards the desired behavior is crucial.  Poorly designed rewards can lead to unexpected or suboptimal agent behavior.  Experimentation is key.
- **Computational cost:**  Training reinforcement learning agents can be computationally expensive.  Simplifying the game environment and choosing a less computationally demanding algorithm can mitigate this.  Using pre-trained models could be considered if time permits.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement learning principles and algorithms: This project reinforces understanding of how reinforcement learning algorithms work, including the agent-environment interaction loop, reward functions, and policy updates.
- Prototyping and iterative development: The project emphasizes efficient prototyping and iterative refinement, crucial skills in software engineering.
