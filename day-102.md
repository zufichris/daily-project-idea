# Minimax AI for a Simplified Board Game

## Overview

This project focuses on building a Minimax AI agent for a simplified version of a board game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four with a smaller board).  The goal is to create a functional AI that can play optimally against a human player within a limited timeframe.  This provides a practical application of the Minimax algorithm and allows for exploration of game tree search optimization techniques.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `numpy` (for board representation), potentially `pygame` (for visualization, optional)

## Features & Requirements

- **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:** The core functionality involves implementing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient search.
- **Game Board Representation:**  A data structure (e.g., NumPy array) to efficiently represent the game board state.
- **Move Generation:**  A function to generate all legal moves for the current player.
- **Game Logic:** Functions to determine the game state (win, lose, draw).
- **Human-AI Interaction:**  A simple command-line or basic GUI interface for the human player to interact with the AI.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Heuristic function for faster evaluation in deeper games,  implementation of a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for a more robust approach (if time permits).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Board Representation & Game Logic:** Define the game board data structure and implement functions to handle moves, determine win/lose/draw conditions.
2. **Minimax Algorithm:** Implement the core Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient exploration of the game tree.
3. **Move Generation:**  Create a function to generate all valid moves for a given board state.
4. **AI vs. Human Play:** Integrate the Minimax agent with a simple interface allowing a human to play against the AI.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the AI against different strategies and refine the algorithm based on observations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:** For larger game boards, the search space can become computationally expensive.  Careful implementation of alpha-beta pruning is crucial.
- **Heuristic Function Design (Optional):** If implementing an optional heuristic function, choosing a relevant and efficient heuristic is essential for performance.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Minimax Algorithm:**  A deeper understanding of the Minimax algorithm, its application in game playing, and the effectiveness of alpha-beta pruning.
- **Game AI Development:** Practical experience in designing and implementing an AI agent for a game, including board representation, move generation, and game logic.
