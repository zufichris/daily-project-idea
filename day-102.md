# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition. This allows for a more intuitive and contactless interaction method compared to traditional interfaces.  The focus will be on a simplified yet functional prototype to showcase the core concept within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision and image processing), MediaPipe (for hand gesture recognition),  `RPi.GPIO` (if using a Raspberry Pi for hardware control).
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi (or any suitable microcontroller),  Webcam, Smart Lamp/Fan (with API or GPIO control).


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:** The system should accurately detect pre-defined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for on, closed fist for off, two fingers for dimming).
- **Appliance Control:**  The detected gestures should trigger corresponding actions on the chosen smart home appliance (e.g., turning the lamp on/off, adjusting fan speed).
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple visual feedback mechanism indicating the recognized gesture and appliance status. (Optional:  a basic GUI using Tkinter or similar)
- **Calibration:**  The system should allow for initial calibration to account for variations in lighting and hand positioning.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of gesture recognition errors (e.g., displaying an error message if a gesture is not recognized).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Gesture Recognition Setup:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking model into a Python script using OpenCV.  Focus on detecting a limited set of pre-defined gestures.
2. **Appliance Control Integration:**  Establish communication with the chosen smart home appliance. This might involve using an existing API or directly controlling GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi if using a DIY appliance.
3. **Gesture-Action Mapping:**  Implement logic to map detected gestures to appliance control actions.
4. **UI Development (Optional):**  Create a simple UI to display the recognized gesture and appliance status.
5. **Testing and Calibration:**  Thoroughly test the system, adjusting parameters as needed to improve accuracy and reliability.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  MediaPipe's accuracy can be affected by lighting conditions, hand position, and background clutter. Addressing these limitations within the short timeframe requires careful selection of the environment and potentially simplifying gestures.
- **Hardware Integration (if applicable):**  Connecting and controlling the smart appliance might involve troubleshooting hardware-specific issues.  Using a simulated appliance in the initial stages can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Gain practical experience with OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand gesture recognition.
- **Hardware-Software Integration:**  Understand the principles and challenges of integrating software with physical hardware (if using a Raspberry Pi).
