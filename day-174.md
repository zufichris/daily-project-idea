# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, self-calibrating robotic arm control system using a camera for feedback.  The system will use computer vision to identify a target object, calculate its position in 3D space, and then adjust the robotic arm's position accordingly. This is a simplified version of a crucial task in advanced robotics, achievable in a short time frame.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a suitable robotic arm library (e.g., for a specific hardware platform like Arduino or ROS).
- Tools: A robotic arm (physical or simulated), a webcam or camera, a computer with sufficient processing power.

## Features & Requirements
- **Target Detection:**  Identify a pre-defined object (e.g., a colored block) in the camera's field of view using OpenCV.
- **3D Position Estimation:** Calculate the 3D coordinates of the target object relative to the camera using known camera parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic calibration).
- **Arm Control:**  Send commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the calculated 3D position.
- **Error Correction:** Implement a basic feedback loop to iteratively refine the arm's position based on the visual feedback.
- **Visual Display:**  Display camera feed and calculated target position on the screen for debugging and monitoring.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more robust error handling mechanism (e.g., dealing with occlusions).
- **Advanced Feature:**  Use a more sophisticated algorithm for 3D position estimation (e.g., Structure from Motion).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Calibration:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. If using a physical arm, calibrate its kinematics (forward and inverse kinematics). This may involve using pre-existing calibration tools depending on the robotic arm used.
2. **Target Detection and Tracking:** Implement OpenCV code to detect and track the target object.  Use color filtering or object recognition techniques.
3. **3D Position Estimation:** Implement the 3D position estimation algorithm. Simplify using known camera parameters or use a basic triangulation method if time is limited.
4. **Arm Control:** Write the code to send control commands to the robotic arm based on the calculated 3D position.
5. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate all components and test the system's performance. Refine the algorithm based on observations.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Camera Calibration:** Accurate camera calibration is crucial for accurate 3D position estimation. This step can be time-consuming if not already done.  Use simplified methods or pre-calibrated parameters where possible.
- **Robotic Arm Kinematics:**  The complexity of the robotic arm's kinematic model can significantly impact the implementation time.  Consider using a simple robotic arm with a well-documented kinematic model.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience with image processing, object detection, and 3D position estimation.
- **Improve robotic control skills:** Gain practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic arm control, including feedback loops and error correction.
