# Minimax AI for a Simplified Tic-Tac-Toe Variant

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Minimax AI agent for a slightly modified Tic-Tac-Toe game.  The modification introduces a "block" mechanic: a player can choose to "block" an opponent's next move, preventing them from placing a piece in a specific cell. This adds a strategic layer to the classic game, making the Minimax algorithm's implementation more challenging and interesting. The goal is to create a functional AI opponent that plays optimally or near-optimally within the timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `numpy` (optional, for efficient array handling)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI).  A simple text-based interface is acceptable for a quicker implementation.
    - An AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency.
    - The "block" mechanic implemented for both players (human and AI).
    - Game result determination (win, lose, draw).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Difficulty levels by adjusting the search depth in the Minimax algorithm.
    -  A simple evaluation function that scores board states to improve AI decision-making.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board and Rules:** Create the game board representation (e.g., a 3x3 NumPy array or a list of lists) and implement the game's core logic including the "block" mechanic.
2. **Minimax Algorithm:** Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.  Focus on a recursive implementation for clarity.
3. **GUI (Optional):** If time permits, create a basic GUI using a library like Pygame or Tkinter to visualize the game. Otherwise, a simple text-based interface will suffice.
4. **AI Integration:** Integrate the Minimax AI into the game loop, allowing the AI to make moves based on the current game state.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the game against various opponents (human or a simple random AI) to identify bugs and areas for improvement.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning Optimization:** Efficient implementation of alpha-beta pruning is crucial for performance, especially with increased search depth.
- **Handling the "Block" Mechanic:**  Correctly integrating the "block" mechanic into the Minimax evaluation function requires careful consideration of the game state changes.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Minimax Algorithm:** This project provides hands-on experience in implementing and optimizing the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental concept in AI game playing.
- **Strategic Game AI Design:**  Understanding how to adapt algorithms to handle nuanced game mechanics (like the "block" mechanic) and design effective evaluation functions.
