# Self-Balancing Robot Control using PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for a simulated or physical self-balancing two-wheeled robot.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing and controlled movement using a PID algorithm tuned for optimal performance within a short timeframe. This exercise reinforces practical control system design and implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for simulation, optional), NumPy, SciPy (for control system calculations)
* **Hardware (optional):** Arduino, IMU (e.g., MPU6050), motor drivers, two DC motors, robot chassis.
* **Simulation Environment (optional):** V-REP, Gazebo

## Features & Requirements

- **Balancing:** The robot should maintain an upright position when stationary.
- **Motor Control:** Individual motor speeds should be adjusted to maintain balance.
- **PID Tuning Interface:** Allow for real-time adjustment of PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).
- **Sensor Integration (optional):**  Interface with an IMU to obtain accurate angular velocity and acceleration data.
- **Data Logging (optional):** Record sensor data and control outputs for analysis.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Setup:**  Create a simplified dynamic model of the robot (either using physics simulation or a mathematical model) if not using a physical robot. This can involve defining equations of motion.
2. **PID Implementation:** Implement a PID controller algorithm in Python.  Start with initial gain values, providing basic functionality.
3. **Gain Tuning:** Using the simulation or physical robot, tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) iteratively to achieve stable balancing.  Visualize or log the robot's angle and motor speeds to assist tuning.
4. **Control Integration:** Integrate the PID controller with the motor control system (simulated or physical).
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the robot's balancing capabilities under various disturbances. Refine the PID gains to improve performance and robustness.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Oscillations:** Achieving stable balancing without oscillations requires careful tuning of the PID gains. This requires understanding the effects of each gain (P, I, D).
- **Sensor Noise (if using physical robot):**  Sensor noise from the IMU can impact control accuracy. Implementing filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman filter â€“ optional) might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** Understand the principles of PID control and how to tune PID gains for optimal performance.
- **Control System Implementation:** Gain experience in designing and implementing a control system in a practical context (simulation or physical robot).
