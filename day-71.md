# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified intelligent traffic light system using Python and a suitable visualization library. The goal is to develop a basic model that dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle density at each intersection.  This allows for exploration of basic traffic control algorithms and their impact on overall traffic flow.  The focus will be on a single intersection for a one or two-day challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib or Pygame (for visualization), Random (for vehicle generation)
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm etc.)

## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Randomly generate vehicles approaching the intersection from each direction at varying rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light controller that cycles through green, yellow, and red states.
- **Density-Based Adjustment:** The duration of green light for each direction should dynamically adjust based on the number of vehicles waiting.  A simple threshold-based approach is sufficient.
- **Visualization:**  Visualize the intersection, vehicle movement, and traffic light states using a graphical representation.
- **Data Logging:** Optionally log key metrics such as average waiting time and overall traffic flow.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., a simple queueing model) for more realistic behavior.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Add pedestrian crossings and their control into the simulation.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Vehicle Generation:** Set up the project environment, initialize variables, and implement the random vehicle generation mechanism.  Focus on a single intersection with four directions.
2. **Basic Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller with fixed timing cycles. Visualize the intersection and light states using Matplotlib or Pygame.
3. **Density-Based Adjustment:** Introduce a mechanism to detect vehicle density in each direction and adjust the green light duration accordingly.  Use simple thresholds for now.
4. **Visualization Enhancement:** Improve the visualization to show vehicle movement more realistically, perhaps using simple animations.
5. **Data Logging (Optional):** Implement data logging to track key metrics like average waiting time.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Simplicity and Realism:**  The simulation needs to be simple enough to implement within the time constraints but also realistic enough to be insightful.  Prioritize core features and avoid over-engineering.
- **Algorithm Optimization:**  The density-based adjustment algorithm might require careful tuning to avoid oscillations or instability. Experiment with different threshold values.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce fundamental programming concepts:** Data structures, algorithms, event-driven programming.
- **Gain experience with simulation and modeling:**  Learn how to build a simplified model of a real-world system and use it to explore different scenarios.
