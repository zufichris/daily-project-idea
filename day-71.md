# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking using a Webcam

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object detection and tracking system using a readily available webcam.  The system will detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) and track its movement within the webcam's field of view. This project showcases fundamental computer vision concepts and provides a practical application of object tracking algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam (built-in or external), a computer with a suitable processor.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the webcam feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Display a bounding box around the detected object.
- **Center Point Tracking:** Calculate and display the object's center coordinates in real time.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) achieved by the system.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implementing Kalman Filtering for smoother tracking.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Object classification using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`). Initialize the webcam and display the video feed using OpenCV.
2. **Object Detection:** Define criteria for detecting the target object (e.g., color thresholding for a red ball).  Use OpenCV functions to isolate the object.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using bounding box center point tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Draw bounding boxes and center point coordinates on the video feed. Display the FPS.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and object movements. Refine thresholds and parameters to improve accuracy and performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect object detection accuracy.  Experiment with different color thresholding techniques or more robust object detection algorithms.
- **Occlusion:** If the object is temporarily occluded, the tracking algorithm might lose it. Implementing techniques like Kalman filtering or more advanced tracking algorithms can address this.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision Concepts:**  This project strengthens understanding of image processing, object detection, and tracking.
- **Practical Application of OpenCV:**  Hands-on experience with OpenCV functions for video capture, image manipulation, and display.
