# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home appliance control system using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will allow users to control basic functions of a smart appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using predefined hand gestures captured by a webcam.  This project focuses on rapid prototyping and demonstrates the integration of computer vision and IoT control.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking),  requests (HTTP requests for API interaction)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, Smart appliance with controllable API (e.g., a Philips Hue bulb or a smart fan with an accessible API)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or VS Code


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:** The system should accurately recognize a predefined set of gestures (e.g., open hand for "on", closed fist for "off", thumbs up for "brightness up").
- **Appliance Control:**  The system should send appropriate commands to the smart appliance based on recognized gestures.
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple visual representation of the recognized gesture and the current appliance state (on/off, brightness level).
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for gesture recognition and API communication failures.
- **Calibration:** Allow for initial calibration to adjust to lighting conditions and hand size.

- **Advanced Features:**  Gesture-based control for multiple appliances,  implementation of a simple machine learning model for improved gesture recognition accuracy.
- **Optional Feature:** Incorporate voice commands as an alternative control mechanism.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Calibration:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and calibrate the webcam to optimal lighting conditions.  Test the hand tracking functionality using MediaPipe.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Define a set of gestures and implement the logic for recognizing them using OpenCV and MediaPipe.  Create functions to map gestures to appliance commands.
3. **API Integration:**  Find and integrate the API for the chosen smart appliance. This might involve obtaining API keys or setting up necessary accounts.
4. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI using a library like Tkinter or a simple visualization in a Jupyter Notebook to display the recognized gesture and appliance status.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different hand gestures, lighting conditions and refine the gesture recognition and API communication.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Real-time hand gesture recognition can be sensitive to lighting conditions, background clutter, and hand variations. Robust error handling and potential calibration options are crucial.
- **API limitations:** The chosen smart applianceâ€™s API might have limitations in terms of functionality or rate limiting. Consider these constraints when designing the system.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of computer vision techniques:** This project reinforces understanding of real-time image processing, hand tracking, and gesture recognition.
- **Integration of different software components:** This project highlights the skills needed to integrate multiple libraries and APIs, and manage potential communication errors.
