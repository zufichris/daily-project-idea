# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Tip Control via PID

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simplified control system for a robotic arm tip, focusing on achieving self-balancing using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.  The challenge lies in designing and implementing a stable PID controller within a short timeframe, focusing on precise tip positioning despite external disturbances (e.g., simulated wind).  This is a scaled-down version of a complex control problem, making it suitable for a daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID control implementation), Pygame (for visualization â€“ optional)
- **Hardware (Simulated):**  A simplified 2D robotic arm model can be simulated; no physical hardware is strictly required for this daily challenge.  If hardware is available, consider using an Arduino or similar microcontroller with appropriate sensors (e.g., IMU) and actuators (e.g., servo motors).

## Features & Requirements
- **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement a PID controller to regulate the angle of the robotic arm's end effector (tip) to maintain a desired target angle.
- **Angle Feedback:**  Simulate or obtain angle feedback from a virtual or physical sensor.
- **Setpoint Tracking:** The system should accurately track a dynamically changing setpoint (target angle).
- **Disturbance Rejection (Optional):**  Simulate external disturbances (e.g., wind) and observe the controller's robustness.
- **Visualization (Optional):** Create a visual representation of the robotic arm and its movements using Pygame or similar library.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Model the Robotic Arm:** Create a simplified mathematical model of a 2D robotic arm (or use an existing one).  This could be a simple kinematic model.
2. **Implement the PID Controller:**  Use the SciPy library or write your own PID controller function, tuning the Kp, Ki, and Kd gains experimentally.
3. **Integrate Feedback and Control:** Incorporate the angle feedback into the PID controller, using the error (difference between setpoint and current angle) to adjust the arm's angle.
4. **Simulate or Test with Hardware:** Run simulations with varying setpoints and optional disturbances (if using hardware, test with real-world inputs).
5. **Tune and Refine:** Adjust the PID gains iteratively to optimize performance and minimize oscillations and errors.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and often requires iterative adjustments.  Consider using automated tuning methods if time permits.
- **Sensor Noise (if using hardware):** Real-world sensors introduce noise into the feedback signal, impacting the controller's performance.  Implement appropriate filtering techniques to mitigate this.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control Implementation:** Gain practical experience implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental algorithm in robotics and control systems.
- **System Modeling and Simulation:** Understand how to model a simplified system and use simulation to test and refine control algorithms before deploying them on physical hardware.
