# Smart Home Energy Consumption Visualizer

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple, yet informative dashboard visualizing real-time energy consumption data from a smart home energy monitor. The dashboard will provide insights into individual appliance usage and overall home energy trends, potentially aiding in identifying areas for energy conservation.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and data visualization, not complex analytics.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework/Library:** Streamlit (for rapid UI development), Pandas (for data manipulation),  Matplotlib/Plotly (for data visualization)
- **Data Source:**  Simulated data (CSV file or simple API for demonstration) â€“ can be adapted to integrate with real smart home energy monitors if time permits.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Data Display:** Show current energy consumption (total and per appliance).
- **Historical Data Visualization:** Display energy usage over the last 24 hours, using line charts.
- **Appliance-Specific Breakdown:**  Visually represent energy usage for at least 3 distinct appliances (e.g., Refrigerator, AC, Lighting).
- **Total Daily Consumption Summary:**  Display the total energy consumed for the day.
- **Energy Efficiency Indicator:** Simple color-coded system (green/yellow/red) to visually represent current energy consumption relative to a predefined threshold.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preparation:** Create a sample CSV file or design a simple API endpoint simulating real-time energy data for multiple appliances. Load and preprocess data using Pandas.
2. **Dashboard Creation (Streamlit):**  Structure the Streamlit application with separate sections for real-time data, historical charts, and summary statistics.
3. **Data Visualization:** Implement line charts (Matplotlib/Plotly) to display historical data and appropriate visual elements (e.g., bar charts or gauges) for appliance-specific and total consumption.
4. **Interactive Elements (Optional):** Add interactive elements like selectable time ranges for historical data or adjustable energy consumption thresholds.
5. **Deployment (Optional):** Deploy the Streamlit application using Streamlit Cloud (for quick sharing and accessibility).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Handling:** Efficiently handling and visualizing potentially high-frequency data streams is crucial for a smooth user experience.  If using real data, ensure proper data handling mechanisms.
- **Scalability:**  While the scope is limited, considering the potential scalability of the application for larger datasets or more appliances is essential.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Data Visualization Techniques:**  Reinforce best practices in data visualization for presenting time-series data and creating insightful dashboards.
- **Streamlit Development:** Gain practical experience in using Streamlit for rapid UI development, enhancing skills in building interactive web applications.
