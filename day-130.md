# Self-Balancing Robot Control via PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated or physical self-balancing robot.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing and controlled movement, demonstrating a fundamental control systems concept in a practical robotic application.  This is achievable within a day or two for an experienced individual, focusing on the core PID implementation and tuning.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below)
* **Simulation Environment (Optional but Recommended):** PyBullet or V-REP
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID implementation), Pygame (for visualization if not using a simulation environment)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino or Raspberry Pi with appropriate sensors (IMU, motor drivers) and a physical robot platform.


## Features & Requirements

- **Balancing:** The robot should maintain an upright position even with disturbances.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A functional PID controller should be implemented and tested.
- **Parameter Tuning:**  The PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) should be tuned to achieve optimal performance (minimal oscillations, fast settling time).
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record sensor readings and control outputs for analysis.
- **Visualization (Optional):** Real-time visualization of the robot's state and control actions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Set up the chosen environment (simulation or physical hardware). If using a simulation, create a simplified robot model. If using hardware, connect sensors and actuators.
2. **PID Implementation:** Implement the PID controller algorithm using NumPy or SciPy.  Define the error function based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
3. **Parameter Tuning:** Start with initial PID gain values and iteratively adjust them based on the robot's response. Use trial and error or more advanced tuning methods like Ziegler-Nichols.
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the controller with various disturbances (e.g., simulated pushes or real-world disturbances). Refine the PID gains to optimize performance.
5. **Data Analysis (Optional):** Analyze the logged data to understand the controller's behavior and identify areas for improvement.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Dealing with oscillations and overshoot requires a good understanding of PID control.
- **Sensor Noise (Hardware):**  If using physical hardware, sensor noise can affect the controller's performance.  Appropriate filtering techniques may be needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control theory:**  Hands-on experience implementing and tuning a PID controller.
- **Practical application of control systems in robotics:** Understanding the challenges of applying theoretical concepts to a real-world system.
