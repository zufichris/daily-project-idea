# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed. The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., wave, thumbs up, point) to trigger pre-defined actions like turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or pausing music. This project focuses on efficient prototyping and achieving basic functionality within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), PyAutoGUI (automation)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, Computer (preferably with a decent GPU for faster processing)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  Accurately detect predefined hand gestures from the webcam feed.
- **Action Mapping:** Map detected gestures to specific smart home commands (e.g., wave = lights off, thumbs up = volume up).
- **Command Execution:** Trigger the mapped commands using PyAutoGUI or a similar library to interact with applications or operating systems.
- **User Interface:** A simple GUI to display recognized gestures and current status.
- **Calibration:**  Allow for basic calibration to adjust gesture recognition sensitivity.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple User Support:** Recognize gestures from multiple users simultaneously.
- **Custom Gesture Training:** Allow users to train the system to recognize new gestures.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, test the webcam connection, and acquire sample images/videos of the target gestures.
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Implement a basic gesture recognition pipeline using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution. Focus on recognizing 2-3 distinct gestures.
3. **Action Mapping & Execution:**  Map detected gestures to specific actions (e.g., using conditional statements) and integrate PyAutoGUI or a similar library to execute these actions (e.g., sending keyboard shortcuts, mouse clicks).
4. **GUI Development:** Create a simple GUI (using Tkinter or similar) to display the recognized gesture and current smart home device status.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and gesture variations. Adjust parameters (e.g., gesture detection thresholds) to improve accuracy and responsiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and speed for real-time processing.  This may require optimization techniques if the system struggles with processing speed.
- **Robustness:**  The system needs to be robust against variations in lighting, hand positions, and background clutter.  Using pre-processing techniques to enhance image quality and focusing on easily distinguishable gestures can help mitigate this.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of computer vision:** Gain experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **System integration and automation:**  Learn how to integrate different libraries and tools to build a functional application that interacts with the operating system.
