# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., hand wave, thumbs up/down) and translate them into commands to control smart home devices (simulated in this case). This project focuses on efficient prototyping and demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and machine learning within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite (optional for faster inference)
* **Tools:**  A webcam, Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Webcam Feed Processing:**  Capture and display a live video stream from the webcam.
- **Gesture Detection:**  Detect pre-defined hand gestures (e.g., wave for "lights on/off," thumbs up for "increase volume," thumbs down for "decrease volume").
- **Command Translation:** Translate detected gestures into corresponding commands.
- **Simulated Smart Home Control:**  Simulate the execution of commands (e.g., print to console or use a mock API to represent smart device interaction).
- **Basic UI:** Display the recognized gesture and the corresponding command on the screen.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Customizable Gestures:** Allow users to define their own gestures.
- **Multiple Device Control:** Extend the system to control more than one simulated smart device.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment and Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).
2. **Webcam Feed and Preprocessing:** Capture webcam feed using OpenCV, potentially include image resizing and color space conversion for optimization.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Utilize MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track hand landmarks in the video stream.  Implement gesture classification based on landmark positions.
4. **Command Mapping and Execution:** Create a mapping between recognized gestures and smart home commands. Implement a simple simulation of command execution (e.g., printing to the console).
5. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI using OpenCV's `cv2.putText` function to display the recognized gesture and executed command.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand positions, and background clutter might affect gesture recognition accuracy.  Consider implementing basic noise reduction techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing the video stream in real-time requires efficient algorithm implementation.  If performance is an issue, explore using TensorFlow Lite for faster inference.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time video processing and hand gesture recognition.
- **Developing Real-time Systems:**  Understand the challenges and techniques involved in building responsive applications that process data streams in real-time.
