# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam. The system will leverage machine learning to recognize these micro-gestures, providing a more intuitive and contactless interface than traditional methods. This addresses the growing demand for seamless and accessible smart home technology.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (machine learning), MediaPipe (gesture recognition)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, a webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Capture:**  The system should accurately capture hand gestures from a webcam feed in real-time.
- **Micro-Gesture Recognition:**  The system should be trained to recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., thumb up/down, finger count 1-2).
- **Smart Home Integration (Simulation):** The recognized gestures should trigger simulated actions like turning lights on/off or adjusting volume.  (Actual smart home integration is optional).
- **User Calibration:** Allow brief calibration to account for individual hand sizes and lighting conditions.
- **Accuracy Monitoring:**  Display a confidence score indicating the system's certainty in recognizing a gesture.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Customizable Gestures:** Allow users to define and train new gestures.
- **Multiple User Support:**  Distinguish between different users.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect a dataset of hand images for each gesture using the webcam and OpenCV.  Focus on small variations in gesture executions.
2. **Model Training:** Use MediaPipe's hand detection capabilities and train a simple machine learning model (e.g., a small convolutional neural network) using TensorFlow/PyTorch on the collected data.
3. **Real-time Processing:** Integrate the trained model with OpenCV to process the webcam feed in real-time, classifying gestures.
4. **Action Triggering:** Implement a basic system to simulate smart home control based on the classified gestures (e.g., print commands to the console).
5. **UI Development (Optional):**  Create a simple user interface to display the recognized gesture and its confidence score.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Augmentation:**  The limited time frame may require smart data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting.
- **Robustness to Noise:**  Real-world lighting conditions and background clutter can affect accuracy.  Experiment with different image preprocessing techniques to mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision and machine learning:** This project provides hands-on experience in building a real-time gesture recognition system using popular libraries.
- **Improve skills in data collection, model training, and deployment:** Mastering efficient data collection and model training within a tight deadline is crucial.
