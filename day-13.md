#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration & Control via Web Interface

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simplified control interface for a miniature robotic arm (e.g., a 3-DOF robotic arm kit) using a web application. The goal is to calibrate the arm's position and then control its movement in real-time through a user-friendly web interface.  This demonstrates practical application of robotics control and web technologies.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages:** Python (with libraries listed below), JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**  Flask (Python web framework), Socket.IO (real-time communication), NumPy (numerical computation in Python), potentially a JavaScript library for enhanced UI interaction (e.g., Three.js for 3D visualization - optional).
- **Hardware:** Miniature robotic arm kit (e.g., from Adafruit, SparkFun), microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32), appropriate sensors (optional: for feedback).


## Features & Requirements
- **Calibration Routine:**  A web interface to manually calibrate the zero position of each joint of the robotic arm. This involves setting the minimum and maximum angles for each joint.
- **Manual Joint Control:**  Sliders or buttons on the web interface to control each joint's angle individually.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Visual feedback on the web interface showing the current angle of each joint.
- **Basic Trajectory Control:**  Allow the user to input target coordinates (optional, dependent on arm's capabilities) and the arm attempts to move to that position.
- **Data Logging:** Log joint angles for analysis (optional).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup & Calibration:** Connect the robotic arm to the microcontroller, test the motors and basic movements. Define and implement the calibration routine for setting zero positions.
2. **Python Backend:** Develop a Flask server to handle communication with the microcontroller, receive calibration data, and process control commands. Use Socket.IO for real-time communication.
3. **Web Interface Development:** Create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend to display joint angles, provide control elements (sliders, buttons), and receive data from the Flask server via Socket.IO.
4. **Integration & Testing:**  Integrate the backend and frontend, ensuring real-time communication and control. Test with various inputs and monitor the robotic arm's response.
5. **Optional: Trajectory Control:** Implement a basic inverse kinematics algorithm (if applicable) to enable trajectory control.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Communication Protocol:** Selecting and implementing a reliable communication protocol (e.g., serial communication) between the microcontroller and the Python server.  Handling potential delays and communication errors.
- **Inverse Kinematics (Optional):** Implementing inverse kinematics for trajectory control can be complex, especially for higher-DOF arms. Focusing on a simple 2D or 3D solution may be more appropriate for a short time frame.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of real-time web application development using Python (Flask) and JavaScript (Socket.IO).
- Practical experience in controlling robotic actuators and implementing basic robotic control algorithms.  Experience with calibration and positional feedback is gained.
