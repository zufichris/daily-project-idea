# Smart Home Device Control via Voice and Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home device controller that responds to both voice commands and hand gestures.  The goal is to create a more intuitive and accessible control system for smart home appliances compared to traditional app-based methods. This will involve integrating speech recognition and computer vision techniques for a multi-modal input experience.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * Speech Recognition: `SpeechRecognition`
    * Computer Vision: `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`
    * Communication:  `requests` (for API interaction with hypothetical smart home devices)
* **Hardware:**  Webcam (for gesture recognition), Microphone (for voice recognition).  Note:  This could be simulated if hardware isn't immediately available.
* **Optional:**  A Raspberry Pi for deployment and more efficient real-time processing.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Command Control:**  Recognize and execute basic commands like "Turn on the lights," "Set the thermostat to 72 degrees," "Play music in the living room."
- **Gesture Control:** Detect simple hand gestures (e.g., wave for on/off, thumbs up/down for volume control).
- **Device Integration (Simulated):** Simulate interaction with smart home devices through API calls (HTTP requests) to a locally running mock server.  Responses will be printed to the console.
- **Error Handling:**  Provide informative feedback to the user in case of unrecognized commands or gestures, or API failures.
- **Configuration:** Allow basic configuration of device names and associated API endpoints.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment & Libraries:** Install necessary Python packages and test basic functionality of `SpeechRecognition` and `OpenCV`/`MediaPipe`.
2. **Develop Voice Recognition Module:** Implement a function to capture audio, transcribe it using `SpeechRecognition`, and parse the command to identify actions and target devices.
3. **Develop Gesture Recognition Module:** Implement a function using `OpenCV` and `MediaPipe` to detect predefined hand gestures from webcam input.
4. **Integrate Control Logic:** Combine the voice and gesture modules.  Map commands/gestures to API calls to simulate controlling smart home devices.  Implement error handling.
5. **Create Mock API Server (Optional):** If desired, create a simple web server that simulates smart home devices and returns appropriate responses to API calls.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech & Gesture Recognition:** Real-world noise and variations in user input can affect accuracy. Consider techniques like keyword spotting and robust gesture detection algorithms.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Ensure smooth and responsive execution of commands. Optimizing code and potentially using a more powerful platform like a Raspberry Pi might be necessary for near real-time operation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Input Processing:** Gain practical experience in integrating speech recognition and computer vision for a unified user interface.
- **API Integration & Simulation:**  Learn how to design and interact with APIs, simulating real-world interactions without needing access to actual smart home devices.
