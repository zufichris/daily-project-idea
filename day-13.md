#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple calibration routine for a miniature robotic arm using a computer vision approach. The goal is to accurately map the arm's joint angles to its end-effector position in 3D space. This is a crucial step for precise control and automation in robotic applications.  The miniaturization aspect allows for a quicker prototyping cycle than with larger, more complex arms.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., PySerial for serial communication if using an Arduino-based controller), potentially a ROS (Robot Operating System) node if more sophisticated control is desired.
* **Hardware:** A miniature robotic arm (e.g., a 3-DOF or 4-DOF kit), a webcam or camera, and a computer.

## Features & Requirements

- **Calibration Target Detection:**  The system should accurately detect a known calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) in the camera image.
- **Forward Kinematics Calculation:**  Calculate the end-effector position based on the measured joint angles of the robotic arm (requires knowing the arm's Denavit-Hartenberg parameters).
- **Positional Data Logging:**  Record the corresponding camera coordinates (pixel positions of the target) and joint angles for each calibration point.
- **Inverse Kinematics Approximation:**  Implement a simplified inverse kinematics solution to estimate joint angles based on desired end-effector positions (can be a simple linear approximation for a daily challenge).
- **Accuracy Assessment:**  Quantify the accuracy of the calibration by comparing the predicted end-effector position to the actual position.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated inverse kinematics algorithm (e.g., Jacobian-based iterative method).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Include error compensation based on observed discrepancies during calibration.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Target Detection:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. Implement OpenCV code to detect the checkerboard pattern in the camera feed and extract its corner coordinates.
2. **Forward Kinematics:** Implement the forward kinematics model for the robotic arm.  This involves transforming joint angles into Cartesian coordinates of the end-effector.
3. **Data Acquisition:** Move the robotic arm to several pre-defined joint angles, record the corresponding joint angles and camera coordinates of the checkerboard.
4. **Calibration Model:** Develop a linear least-squares (or other suitable) model to map the camera coordinates to the end-effector positions in the robot's coordinate frame.
5. **Testing and Evaluation:** Test the calibration by commanding the arm to move to different positions and comparing the actual position to the predicted position.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Camera Calibration:** Accurate camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameter estimation is crucial.  Using a pre-calibrated camera or a simpler calibration method might be necessary within the timeframe.
- **Accuracy of Miniature Arm:** Miniature robotic arms may have higher mechanical inaccuracies than larger ones, leading to larger calibration errors.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision for Robotics:**  Reinforces the application of computer vision techniques for robotic control and calibration.
- **Robotics Kinematics:**  Improves understanding of forward and inverse kinematics, a fundamental concept in robotics.
