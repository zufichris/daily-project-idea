# AI-Powered Real-time Object Tracking & Classification for Robotics

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic system for real-time object tracking and classification using a pre-trained AI model within a simulated robotic environment or using a physical robot with a camera. This will demonstrate the integration of computer vision with robotics control, a crucial aspect of many modern robotic applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (AI model), ROS (Robot Operating System, optional for physical robot integration)
* **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (PyCharm, VS Code), potentially Gazebo or a similar robotics simulator. If using a physical robot, the necessary robot SDK and drivers.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Feed Processing:** The system should capture a video stream (simulated or from a camera) and process it in real-time.
- **Object Detection & Classification:**  Utilize a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet) to detect and classify objects within the video frames.
- **Object Tracking:** Implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, DeepSORT) to maintain track of detected objects across frames, even if they're partially occluded.
- **Basic Reporting:** Display the detected object class and bounding box coordinates on the video feed.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the tracked object's position and classification over time.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Integrate with a robotics simulator (Gazebo) or a physical robot to control its movement based on the detected objects (e.g., follow a specific object).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Implement a simple user interface to adjust tracking parameters (e.g., threshold, tracking algorithm).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment & Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries and configure the environment (virtual environment recommended). Download a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Video Capture & Preprocessing:** Write code to capture video frames from a source (camera or simulated video). Implement basic preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, color conversion).
3. **Object Detection & Classification:** Integrate the chosen pre-trained model to detect and classify objects within each frame.
4. **Object Tracking Implementation:**  Implement a tracking algorithm to connect detected objects across frames.
5. **Visualization & Reporting:** Display the processed video with bounding boxes and object labels. Implement data logging if desired.  If integrating with a robot, implement control commands based on object tracking data.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally expensive, especially with high-resolution video and complex models. Consider using a lighter model or optimizing code for speed.
- **Object Occlusion & Tracking Failure:**  Dealing with partially occluded objects and preventing tracking failure is challenging.  Experiment with different tracking algorithms to find what works best.


## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience integrating computer vision with robotics control (or simulation thereof).
-  Reinforce understanding of real-time processing techniques and optimizing code for performance.
