# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic prototype for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus is on rapid prototyping, utilizing readily available libraries and minimizing complexity to achieve functional control of a simulated or actual smart home environment within a short timeframe. This project demonstrates the feasibility of applying computer vision to intuitive human-computer interaction.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), a simple smart home simulator library (e.g., a custom Python class or a lightweight existing API), NumPy.
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with a sufficient processing capability.


## Features & Requirements

- **Hand Detection & Tracking:**  Accurately detect and track the user's hand in real-time using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize predefined simple gestures (e.g., open palm for "ON", closed fist for "OFF", pointing finger for "increase brightness").
- **Smart Home Control Simulation:**  Interface with a simple simulated smart home environment (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting simulated brightness).
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Provide visual feedback (e.g., on-screen display) indicating the recognized gesture and its effect on the simulated devices.
- **Configurable Gestures:** Allow for easy modification of recognized gestures through a simple configuration file.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a basic machine learning model for gesture classification improving accuracy.  Add support for multiple users.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy).  Create a simple smart home simulator class or interface with an existing API if using a real system.
2. **Implement Hand Tracking:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
3. **Develop Gesture Recognition Logic:** Define thresholds and conditions based on landmark positions to recognize predefined gestures.
4. **Integrate with Smart Home Simulation:** Connect the gesture recognition to the simulated smart home environment, triggering actions based on recognized gestures.
5. **Add Real-time Feedback:** Display the recognized gesture and its effect on the simulated environment (e.g., "Light ON," "Brightness Increased").


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand position, and individual hand sizes might affect the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Error handling and potentially some simple calibration routines should be considered.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Processing speed might be a constraint. Optimizing code and potentially downsampling the webcam feed can address performance issues.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforces understanding of computer vision techniques, specifically hand tracking and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Provides practical experience in building real-time applications with a focus on efficient prototyping and iterative development.
