# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball, a person) within a live video feed from a webcam and track its movement, classifying it in real-time. This project demonstrates fundamental computer vision techniques and showcases the power of OpenCV for building practical applications.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam or pre-recorded video file, a suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).  Optional: a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video frames from a webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Detect the pre-defined object within each frame using color filtering or a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across subsequent frames using techniques like Kalman filtering or optical flow.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Display a bounding box around the tracked object in the video feed.
- **Classification (Optional):** Classify the detected object into a predefined category.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy).  If using a pre-trained model, download and integrate it.
2. **Video Capture:** Implement video capture from the webcam using OpenCV's `VideoCapture` function.
3. **Object Detection:** Implement object detection using either color thresholding (simpler, suitable for objects with distinctive colors) or a pre-trained model (more robust, handles variations in object appearance).
4. **Object Tracking:** Implement object tracking using a suitable algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking, Kalman filter). Update the bounding box coordinates based on the tracked object's position.
5. **Visualization:** Display the video feed with the bounding box around the tracked object using OpenCV's drawing functions.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially when using complex object detection models.  Consider optimizing the code and potentially reducing the frame rate if performance is an issue.
- **Occlusion Handling:**  The tracker might lose the object if it becomes temporarily occluded. Implementing more robust tracking algorithms or incorporating prediction techniques can help mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce practical application of OpenCV:**  This project solidifies understanding of image processing, object detection, and tracking using OpenCV.
- **Develop skills in real-time system design:** Building a real-time application requires careful consideration of computational efficiency and resource management.
