# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to design and implement a self-balancing robotic arm using a simple physical model and PID control. The purpose is to demonstrate a fundamental control system in robotics, suitable for a short-term development cycle.  The significance lies in learning PID tuning and implementing a feedback loop for stabilization, core concepts in robotics and control engineering.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pygame (for visualization),  control (optional, for advanced PID implementation)
* **Hardware (Simulated):**  A simplified robotic arm model can be simulated, obviating the need for physical hardware for this daily challenge.


## Features & Requirements

- **Simplified Arm Model:** A 2D model representing a single-joint robotic arm with a weight at the end.
- **Angle Sensing:**  Simulate an angle sensor providing feedback on the arm's position.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A PID controller to maintain the arm at a desired angle despite disturbances.
- **Setpoint Control:** Ability to set a desired angle for the arm to maintain.
- **Visual Feedback:**  Real-time graphical representation of the arm's movement and angle using Pygame.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Adding a simulated external force (e.g., wind gust) to test the robustness of the PID controller.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Implementing different PID tuning methods (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method) for comparison.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Creation:**  Define the simple 2D robotic arm model with parameters (length, mass, etc.) using NumPy.  Establish the physics simulation (e.g., simple pendulum dynamics).
2. **Sensor Simulation:** Create a function that simulates angle sensor readings based on the arm's current state.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Develop the PID controller, defining the proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D) gains.  Tune the PID parameters empirically.
4. **Control Loop Integration:** Combine the model, sensor, and PID controller to create a feedback control loop that updates the arm's angle repeatedly.
5. **Visualization:** Use Pygame to display the arm's movement, angle, and setpoint in real-time.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustment. Starting with simple P-control before adding I and D elements can simplify debugging.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation directly impacts the controller's performance.  Keep the model simple but reasonable.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control concepts:**  Understand and implement a fundamental control algorithm used extensively in robotics and automation.
- **Practical experience with simulation:** Gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing a simulated robotic system.
