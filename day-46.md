# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Mobile Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project aims to build a basic system for a mobile robot to detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in real-time using a camera feed, and then navigate towards it.  This demonstrates a fundamental aspect of robotic perception and control, achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), NumPy (for numerical computation), Robot Operating System (ROS) -  a simplified version can be used if ROS expertise is limited, potentially focusing on simulated robotics.  Consider using a suitable simulator like Gazebo or a simpler alternative.
* **Hardware (Optional):** A mobile robot platform (e.g., a small wheeled robot with a camera), or a simulated robot environment.

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  Detect the target object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using color filtering or a simple machine learning model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position frame-by-frame.
- **Position Estimation:** Estimate the robot's position relative to the object.
- **Navigation:** Implement a simple navigation algorithm (e.g., proportional control) to guide the robot towards the object.
- **Display:** Visualize the detection, tracking, and robot's path on the camera feed.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more robust object detection algorithm (e.g., YOLOv5).  Incorporate obstacle avoidance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) and configure the robot simulation environment or connect to the physical robot.
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm to detect and track the target object using OpenCV.
3. **Position Estimation:** Calculate the object's position relative to the robot's camera using basic trigonometry or image processing techniques.
4. **Navigation Implementation:** Design a simple proportional control algorithm to steer the robot towards the object based on the estimated position.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate all components and test the system, refining the parameters of the controller as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact color-based object detection. Consider using more robust techniques or preprocessing steps to mitigate this.
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally expensive. Optimize the code and choose efficient algorithms.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces practical skills in computer vision, particularly object detection and tracking using OpenCV.
- It provides experience in implementing basic robotic control algorithms and integrating perception and action in a robotic system.
