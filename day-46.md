# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a readily available webcam.  The system will detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view and track its movement, displaying the object's coordinates and potentially its trajectory on the screen. This is a practical application of computer vision and robotics principles, suitable for a quick prototype.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), Webcam (USB), Power supply.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), NumPy.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  The system should accurately detect a specific object (pre-defined color or shape) in real-time.
- **Object Tracking:** The system should track the detected object's movement across consecutive frames.
- **Coordinate Display:** The system should display the object's (centroid) x and y coordinates on the screen.
- **Frame Rate Monitoring:** Display the current frames per second (FPS) for performance evaluation.
- **Output Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes around the detected object.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a simple prediction algorithm to anticipate the object's future position (limited to a few frames).
- **Optional Feature:**  Save the tracked object's trajectory data to a file for later analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Connect the webcam to the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`).
2. **Object Detection:**  Write a Python script using OpenCV to capture frames from the webcam. Implement a color thresholding or shape detection algorithm to identify the target object.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's tracking functions (e.g., `cv2.track.createTracker`) or implement a simple algorithm based on comparing consecutive frames to track the object's movement.
4. **Coordinate Display and Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and display the object's coordinates on each frame using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Performance Evaluation:**  Display the FPS to assess the system's real-time capabilities.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of color-based object detection.  Consider implementing robust lighting compensation techniques or switching to a shape-based detection approach.
- **Occlusion:** If the object is temporarily occluded, the tracking algorithm might lose track. Implement a mechanism to re-acquire the object after occlusion.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:**  Gain practical experience with real-time image processing using OpenCV.
- **Computer vision fundamentals:** Enhance understanding of object detection, tracking, and basic computer vision algorithms.
