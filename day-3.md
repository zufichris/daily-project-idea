# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp) using real-time hand gesture recognition from a webcam.  The focus is on creating a functional, albeit limited, system within a short timeframe, emphasizing rapid prototyping and efficient implementation.  This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and machine learning in a common IoT context.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand detection and tracking), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for faster inference if pre-trained model is used)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, Smart Lamp (or simulated control via a simple API)
- **Optional:** Raspberry Pi (for deployment on a dedicated device)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Hand Detection:** Accurately detect and track hands in the webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize a predefined set of gestures (e.g., open palm for ON, closed fist for OFF, pointing up for brightness increase).
- **Appliance Control:** Send commands to a smart lamp (or simulated control) based on recognized gestures.
- **User Interface (UI):**  A simple display showing the recognized gesture and appliance status.
- **Calibration:**  A quick calibration step to adjust to different lighting conditions.

- **Advanced Features:**  Support for multiple appliances,  different gesture sets.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a home automation system (e.g., Home Assistant).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe). Set up the connection to the smart lamp (or create a simulated control interface).
2. **Hand Detection and Tracking:** Implement hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe's solutions.  Visualize the detected hand landmarks on the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Define a simple gesture recognition algorithm (e.g., based on landmark distances and angles). You can use a rule-based approach for a quick prototype.
4. **Appliance Control Integration:**  Link the recognized gestures to commands for controlling the smart lamp (e.g., ON/OFF, brightness adjustment).
5. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI (using a library like Tkinter or a simple visualization with OpenCV) to display the recognized gesture and appliance status.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  Hand detection and gesture recognition can be affected by lighting conditions, background clutter, and hand occlusion.  Focusing on a limited set of simple, easily distinguishable gestures will improve robustness.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and speed is crucial. Using optimized libraries and potentially a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Lite can improve performance.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Hands-on experience with real-time object detection and tracking using MediaPipe.
- **Rapid Prototyping:**  Developing a functional prototype with limited resources and time constraints, emphasizing efficient code and iterative development.
