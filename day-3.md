#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using a single camera and readily available computer vision libraries.  The goal is to create a simple yet functional system capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles within a limited space. This is a valuable exercise in applying computer vision techniques to a real-world robotic problem within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
* **Hardware:**  A miniature drone (e.g., a commercially available quadcopter with a camera module), a laptop/computer for processing.
* **Optional:**  A simulator like AirSim for testing and development before deploying on a physical drone (Reduces risk of damaging the drone).


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Detection:**  The system should identify obstacles (e.g., objects, walls) in the camera feed using image processing techniques (e.g., background subtraction, color thresholding).
- **Distance Estimation:**  The system should estimate the distance to detected obstacles using simple methods like perspective transformation or depth estimation (if camera allows).
- **Avoidance Maneuver:** The system should trigger appropriate motor commands to steer the drone away from detected obstacles.  This could be a simple turn or a combination of altitude and direction changes.
- **Real-time Processing:** The system should process the camera feed and react to obstacles in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Emergency Stop:** Implement a failsafe mechanism to stop the drone if an obstacle is detected too close.

- **Advanced Features:** Calibrate the camera for better accuracy in distance estimation. Integrate a more sophisticated path planning algorithm (e.g., A*).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Capture a sample video of the drone's environment. Preprocess the video (resize, convert to grayscale, etc.) to optimize processing speed.
2. **Obstacle Detection:** Implement an obstacle detection algorithm using OpenCV functions. Experiment with different techniques (background subtraction, edge detection, etc.) to find the best approach for the available data.
3. **Distance Estimation (Simplified):** Implement a basic distance estimation method.  For simplicity, focus on detecting the size of the obstacle in the image â€“ larger objects are closer.
4. **Control Integration:**  Write code to interface with the drone's control API (if available) to send commands based on detected obstacles.  Start with simple commands like turning left or right.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Test the system in a controlled environment (or using a simulator) and refine the algorithms based on the results. Iterate rapidly, focusing on stability and responsiveness.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time constraints:** Processing the camera feed and controlling the drone in real-time requires efficient algorithms and optimization.
- **Accuracy of distance estimation:**  Simple distance estimation methods can be inaccurate. Calibration is important but might be challenging within a short timeframe.  Focus on robust obstacle avoidance even with imperfect distance information.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of computer vision concepts (image processing, object detection).
- Practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic control systems.
