# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent capable of learning to play a simplified version of a classic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four) using reinforcement learning. The focus is on rapid prototyping and showcasing fundamental RL concepts within a limited timeframe.  The significance lies in understanding and implementing core RL algorithms to solve a defined problem.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A suitable game environment (can be custom-built or utilize a lightweight existing library)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A functional implementation of a simplified game (e.g., 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe).
- **RL Agent:** An agent that learns through reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler variant).
- **Training Loop:**  A clear training loop that iteratively improves the agent's strategy.
- **Performance Evaluation:** A mechanism to assess the agent's performance (e.g., win rate against a random opponent).
- **Visualization (Optional):** Basic visualization of the game state and agent's actions during training or gameplay.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implementing an Îµ-greedy exploration strategy for more robust learning.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Saving and loading trained models for future use.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment:** Design and implement the chosen game's rules and logic. This should be straightforward and easily testable.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Define the agent's state representation, action space, and reward function. Choose an appropriate RL algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point).
3. **Training Loop:**  Develop a loop that runs multiple game simulations, allowing the agent to learn from its experience.  Focus on a small, manageable number of training iterations given the time constraint.
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the agent's performance against a simple baseline (e.g., a random player) to assess its learning progress.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** Implement basic visualization if time allows.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal learning parameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) within the limited timeframe might be challenging.  Start with reasonable defaults and iterate if time permits.
- **Overfitting:**  The agent might overfit to the simplified game environment.  Addressing this would require more advanced techniques beyond the scope of a daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement learning concepts:  This project reinforces the understanding of core RL principles, such as state, action, reward, and the learning process itself.
- Practical implementation: Participants gain hands-on experience implementing and evaluating an RL agent in a tangible application.
