# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model.  The significance lies in exploring a more intuitive and hands-free interaction method compared to traditional voice or app-based controls.  This prototype will focus on a single appliance and a limited set of gestures, making it achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model optimization)
* **Hardware:** Webcam (or a pre-recorded video dataset)
* **Software:** Jupyter Notebook (or similar IDE)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., hand up for "ON," hand down for "OFF," hand wave for "Brightness Up").
- **Appliance Control:**  The recognized gestures should trigger corresponding actions on a chosen smart home appliance (simulated or real).
- **Real-time Processing:**  The system should process gestures in real-time with minimal latency.
- **User Interface:** A simple graphical user interface (GUI) displaying the recognized gesture and appliance status.
- **Calibration:**  Allow for initial calibration to account for variations in lighting and camera position.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Extend to control multiple appliances with different gesture combinations.
- **Model Training/Refinement:** Integrate a simple model training loop to improve gesture recognition accuracy over time.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect a dataset of hand gestures (images or video) for training (or use a pre-existing dataset). Preprocess the data (resizing, normalization).
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Implement a simple gesture recognition model using MediaPipe's pose estimation capabilities.  This avoids the need for complex model training from scratch within the day's timeframe.
3. **Appliance Interface:**  Establish communication with the target smart appliance (simulated using a simple Python script or real using its API).
4. **GUI Development:** Create a basic GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to display the recognized gesture and appliance status.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate the gesture recognition, appliance control, and GUI components. Test thoroughly with different lighting conditions and hand movements.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Achieving high accuracy with a simple model and limited training data can be challenging. Addressing this might involve careful data collection and preprocessing.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing images in real-time can be computationally intensive. Optimization techniques might be necessary to maintain acceptable performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Reinforce understanding of image processing, feature extraction, and real-time video analysis.
- **Application Development:**  Gain experience in integrating different libraries and technologies to build a functional application.
