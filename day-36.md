# Automated Code Style Enforcement with a Custom Rule

## Overview
This project aims to develop a proof-of-concept tool for automatically enforcing a custom coding style rule within a specific programming language (e.g., Python).  The tool will analyze code, identify violations of the defined rule, and provide clear feedback for remediation.  This is significant because it allows developers to automate the enforcement of specific, potentially complex, style guidelines beyond what standard linters typically offer.


## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- `ast` (Python's Abstract Syntax Trees library)
- `flake8` (or similar linter) as a base (optional, for integration)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Feature 1:** Define a custom coding style rule (e.g., "No more than three consecutive lines of comments").
- **Core Feature 2:** Parse Python code using `ast` to analyze the structure and identify violations of the custom rule.
- **Core Feature 3:** Report violations with clear line numbers and descriptions.
- **Core Feature 4:**  (Optional) Output results in a format compatible with existing CI/CD pipelines (e.g., JUnit XML).
- **Core Feature 5:** (Optional) Integrate with `flake8` plugin architecture to seamlessly integrate the custom rule into the existing workflow.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Define the Custom Rule:**  Clearly articulate the chosen custom coding style rule in detail and design the logic to detect violations.
2. **AST Parsing and Violation Detection:**  Implement Python code using the `ast` module to traverse the abstract syntax tree of the input code and identify violations based on the defined rule.
3. **Reporting:**  Generate a report detailing the location and description of each violation encountered.
4. **(Optional) Integration:** Integrate the functionality as a `flake8` plugin.
5. **Testing:** Test the tool with various code samples, including both valid and invalid code according to the custom rule.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **AST Complexity:** Understanding and navigating Python's `ast` can be challenging, especially for complex coding styles.  Careful planning and modular design are vital.
- **Rule Definition:**  Creating a robust rule that accurately and comprehensively detects violations can be time-consuming and require iterative refinement.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and their application in static code analysis.
- Gain practical experience with implementing and integrating custom code analysis tools, strengthening skills in automated code quality and style enforcement.
