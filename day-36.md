# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object tracking and classification system using a web browser and WebRTC.  The system will leverage a user's webcam to capture video, perform object detection and tracking, and display the results overlaid on the live video feed.  This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and real-time communication technologies accessible through the browser.  The significance lies in its potential for applications in augmented reality, remote monitoring, and interactive interfaces.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with TypeScript for improved code maintainability)
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow.js (for model inference), OpenCV.js (for image processing - optional, can be replaced with TensorFlow.js's image processing capabilities), WebRTC (for real-time video streaming)
* **Tools:**  A web browser (Chrome recommended), a code editor (VS Code recommended), potentially a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Acquire video stream from the user's webcam using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Detect objects within the video frames using a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model (e.g., MobileNet SSD).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected objects across frames using a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking).
- **Classification & Labeling:** Display labels (e.g., "person," "car," "dog") for each detected object on the video feed.
- **Performance Visualization:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to gauge performance.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement more robust tracking using DeepSORT or similar techniques. Add a user interface allowing model selection or parameter adjustments.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the WebRTC connection:** Establish a connection to the user's webcam and display the video stream in a canvas element.
2. **Load and initialize the object detection model:** Load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model.
3. **Implement object detection and tracking:**  Process each video frame, run the model to detect objects, and track them across frames.
4. **Overlay results:** Draw bounding boxes and labels on the canvas to visualize the detected and tracked objects.
5. **Display FPS:** Calculate and display the frames processed per second to monitor performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance optimization:** Running object detection on every frame can be computationally expensive.  Consider reducing the frame rate or using a less computationally intensive model.
- **Model selection:**  Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model with a good balance between accuracy and speed is crucial for real-time performance.  MobileNet SSD is a good starting point.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with WebRTC:** Gain hands-on experience with real-time video streaming using WebRTC.
- **Application of TensorFlow.js:** Apply TensorFlow.js for real-time object detection and classification in a browser environment.  This reinforces understanding of model inference, performance considerations within browser contexts, and integration with other browser APIs.
