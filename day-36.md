# Automated Code Style Enforcement Bot

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple bot that automatically enforces a specific code style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) on a given code repository.  This is significant because consistent code style improves readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.  The focus is on a quick prototype demonstrating core functionality, not a fully-fledged, production-ready tool.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pycodestyle` (or `flake8`), `github3.py` (or similar for GitHub API access), potentially `requests` for general HTTP requests.
- **Tools:**  A GitHub account (for testing against a public repo), a code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

## Features & Requirements

- **Code Style Check:** The bot should analyze a given code file (e.g., Python `.py` file) for style violations using `pycodestyle`.
- **Violation Reporting:**  It should generate a report listing all identified style violations with line numbers.
- **GitHub Integration (Optional):**  The bot could be extended to interact with a GitHub repository, possibly commenting on pull requests with style violation reports.
- **Automated Fixing (Advanced):**  Implement basic auto-formatting capabilities using a tool like `autopep8`. This is optional and increases complexity.
- **Customizable Configuration:** Allow users to specify a configuration file defining the code style rules.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary Python libraries (`pycodestyle`, `github3.py` if needed).
2. **Implement Code Style Check:** Write a function that uses `pycodestyle` to analyze a given code file and return a list of violations.
3. **Create Report Generation:** Develop a function to format the violations into a readable report (console output initially).
4. **(Optional) GitHub Integration:**  If tackling the optional GitHub feature, write code to authenticate with the GitHub API, access a repository, and post comments.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test thoroughly with sample code, focusing on edge cases and error handling.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Different Code Styles:**  Adapting to various code style guides might require more sophisticated parsing or configuration options.
- **GitHub API Rate Limits:** If integrating with GitHub, be mindful of API rate limits to avoid exceeding them during testing.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce API interaction skills:**  Working with the GitHub API (if implemented) strengthens skills in API calls, authentication, and error handling.
- **Improve understanding of code style and linters:**  This project provides practical experience with code style enforcement tools and the importance of maintaining consistent code formatting.
