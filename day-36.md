# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a gesture recognition system using a microcontroller with machine learning capabilities (TinyML).  The system will recognize a small set of predefined hand gestures captured by an inexpensive sensor (e.g., a simple accelerometer or a low-resolution camera), triggering actions within a simulated or real smart home environment.  This demonstrates the feasibility of resource-constrained machine learning for interactive applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** C++ (for Arduino/ESP32) or MicroPython.
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or ESP32-CAM.
* **ML Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro or similar.
* **Sensor:**  Accelerometer (e.g., built-in to Nano 33 BLE Sense) or low-resolution camera module (e.g., on ESP32-CAM).
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
* **Simulation (Optional):**  Home Assistant API or a custom simulation script.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  The system should accurately capture accelerometer data or image data representing pre-defined gestures (e.g., wave, swipe, fist).
- **Gesture Classification:** Employ a TinyML model (e.g., a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier or a simple convolutional neural network) to classify the captured data.
- **Action Triggering:**  Map classified gestures to specific smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).
- **Real-time Processing:** The processing should be fast enough to provide near real-time feedback.
- **Model Training:** A pre-trained model can be used initially, focusing on deployment, with option to fine-tune later.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **User Calibration:** Allow the user to calibrate the model to their specific gestures.
- **Multiple Gesture Recognition:** Expand to recognize more than 2-3 gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect training data for each gesture using the chosen sensor and preprocess the data (e.g., filtering noise, feature extraction). Use a pre-existing dataset if time is extremely limited.
2. **Model Training/Selection:** Train a simple TinyML model (or use a pre-trained one from TensorFlow Hub or a similar source) using the collected data or a suitable dataset.  Focus on model size for inference efficiency.
3. **Microcontroller Integration:** Port the trained model to the chosen microcontroller and integrate the sensor input and model inference into the microcontroller code.
4. **Action Integration:** Implement the logic to map gesture classifications to specific smart home actions.  This could involve simulated actions or interaction with a real smart home API.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the model or parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:** Ensuring sufficient and high-quality training data for reliable gesture classification is crucial.  Data augmentation techniques may be necessary.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing model accuracy with real-time performance on a resource-constrained device is a challenge.  Model optimization is essential.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Development:** Gain practical experience in developing and deploying TinyML models on a microcontroller.
- **Sensor Integration:** Enhance skills in integrating sensors and processing sensor data for real-time applications.
