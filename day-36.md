# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robot Navigation

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI-powered image captioning system integrated with simulated robot navigation. The system will process images captured by a simulated robot camera, generate descriptive captions, and use these captions to guide the robot's movement towards a specified target object described in natural language. This project focuses on the core image captioning and basic navigation aspects, leaving advanced features like complex scene understanding for future expansion.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), PyTorch or TensorFlow (for image captioning model), a suitable robotics simulation environment (e.g., PyBullet, Gazebo - simplified setup), transformers library (for pre-trained models)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE.

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture images from a simulated robot camera and preprocess them (resizing, normalization).
- **Caption Generation:** Utilize a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from Hugging Face's model hub) to generate descriptive captions for the images.
- **Target Object Identification:**  The system should identify if a user-specified target object (e.g., "red ball," "blue box") is present in the generated caption.
- **Basic Navigation:** Implement simple navigation logic based on the caption. If the target object is identified, the robot moves towards it; otherwise, it explores its surroundings.
- **Output Visualization:** Display the robot's environment, captured images, generated captions, and robot's trajectory.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a more sophisticated navigation algorithm (e.g., A*, Dijkstra's) for efficient path planning.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integrate a speech synthesis system to verbally report the robot's actions and observations.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Environment:** Set up the chosen robotics simulation environment and install necessary Python libraries.  Load a simple simulated environment with a target object.
2. **Image Captioning Integration:** Integrate a pre-trained image captioning model and test its ability to generate captions from images captured by the simulated robot camera.
3. **Target Object Detection:** Implement logic to parse the generated captions and identify the presence of the target object based on user input.
4. **Basic Navigation Implementation:**  Implement a simple navigation algorithm that moves the robot towards the direction of the identified target object using simulated actuators.
5. **Visualization & Testing:** Display the robot's view, generated captions, and navigation path in real-time. Test with different scenarios and target objects.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Selection & Performance:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained captioning model that balances accuracy and inference speed is crucial for a daily challenge timeframe.  Consider using a smaller, faster model.
- **Real-time Processing:** Achieving real-time performance with image processing and caption generation might require optimizations and careful consideration of hardware resources.  Simplifying the environment and model is key.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces understanding of integrating pre-trained AI models (e.g., for image captioning) into robotic applications.
- Provides hands-on experience with robotic simulation, image processing, and basic navigation algorithms.
