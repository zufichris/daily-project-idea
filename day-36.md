# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera. The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a person, a car, or a specific colored object) within the camera's field of view, displaying the tracked object's location and potentially its trajectory. This is a valuable prototype for applications in surveillance, robotics, and automated systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (4 recommended), USB camera, power supply.
* **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (or a similar lightweight object detection model).
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, Pillow (optional, for image processing).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Identify a predefined object within the camera's feed using a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:**  Track the identified object's movement across frames, providing its coordinates (x,y) in real-time.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the tracked object with a bounding box and potentially a trajectory line on the camera feed.
- **FPS Measurement:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Log the object's coordinates and timestamp for later analysis.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implementing object classification beyond simple detection (e.g., distinguishing between different types of cars).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Adding a simple user interface (UI) to control parameters like the target object or detection model.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Installation:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) on the Raspberry Pi. Set up the camera and test the connection.
2. **Model Selection and Loading:** Choose a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, EfficientDet Lite) optimized for resource-constrained devices. Download and load it into the Python script.
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Implement the core logic using OpenCV: read frames from the camera, run the object detection model, track the object's centroid across frames using techniques like Kalman filtering or simple centroid tracking.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and a trajectory line onto the camera feed using OpenCV's drawing functions. Display FPS.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and object distances. Adjust parameters (e.g., detection confidence threshold) for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:**  Balancing detection accuracy and speed on a resource-constrained device like a Raspberry Pi might require optimizing the model or reducing image resolution.
- **Object Occlusion:** Handling situations where the target object is partially or fully occluded requires robust tracking algorithms.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical skills in real-time image processing and computer vision.** This project solidifies understanding of object detection, tracking algorithms, and the practical application of deep learning models on embedded systems.
- **Develop experience working with embedded systems (Raspberry Pi) and integrating hardware and software.** This enhances the understanding of practical constraints and optimization techniques needed for resource-limited environments.
