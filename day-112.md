# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple but functional real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera and WebRTC for streaming.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and track its movement within the camera's field of view, displaying the tracking information overlaid on the video stream. This demonstrates core concepts in computer vision and real-time streaming.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for object detection model - pre-trained model preferred), WebRTC (using a library like aiortc), Flask (or similar web framework)
- **Tools:**  A web camera, suitable IDE (PyCharm, VS Code), virtual environment (venv or conda).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the video stream from the webcam.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement frame-by-frame, displaying its centroid coordinates.
- **WebRTC Streaming:** Stream the video with overlaid tracking information to a web browser using WebRTC.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement object classification beyond simple detection (multiple objects). Integrate a client-side JavaScript component for interaction with the stream.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Model Loading:** Set up the environment, install libraries, and load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a MobileNet SSD model from TensorFlow Hub).  Focus on a lightweight model for real-time performance.
2. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Write the core logic to process video frames from the webcam, detect the object, track it using a simple algorithm like centroid tracking, and draw the bounding box and overlay.
3. **WebRTC Integration:** Implement the WebRTC server using Flask and aiortc to stream the processed video frames to a web browser. Handle media encoding and decoding.
4. **Client-Side Integration (Optional):**  Create a simple HTML page to receive and display the WebRTC stream.
5. **Testing and Optimization:** Test the system, focusing on performance and stability.  Optimize for real-time processing if necessary (consider reducing image resolution or simplifying the tracking algorithm).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing accuracy and speed of object detection and tracking can be challenging.  Choosing a lightweight model and optimizing code is crucial.
- **WebRTC Complexity:** Integrating WebRTC might require understanding of its signaling and media handling mechanisms.  Using a simplified library can ease this process.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of object detection and tracking algorithms.**
- **Experience with real-time video processing and WebRTC for streaming applications.**
