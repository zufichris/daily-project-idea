# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent using reinforcement learning to play a minimal 2D game.  The game's complexity will be intentionally low to allow for significant progress within a day or two. The goal is to demonstrate the basic principles of reinforcement learning and build a functional AI agent capable of learning optimal game strategies.  This project is significant because it provides a practical and readily understandable application of a complex machine learning concept.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 or similar (e.g., Ray RLlib for more advanced users)
* **Game Engine (Optional):** Pygame (for visualization, not strictly required for core functionality)
* **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A simple 2D game (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items). The game's rules and state representation should be straightforward.
- **AI Agent:** An agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
- **Reward System:** A clear and concise reward function defining the agent's goals (e.g., reaching the goal in a maze, collecting all items).
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the agent over multiple iterations, observing its actions and updating its policy accordingly.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics to assess the agent's performance (e.g., average steps to reach the goal).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a different RL algorithm (DQN).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Visualize the agent's learning process using Pygame.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Game:** Design a simple 2D game environment with clear rules and a reward structure.  Represent the game state using a suitable data structure (e.g., NumPy array).
2. **Choose an RL Algorithm:** Select a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO is recommended for its relative ease of use and strong performance).
3. **Implement the Agent:** Integrate the chosen algorithm using the selected library (Stable Baselines3).  Define the agent's action space and observation space based on the game environment.
4. **Train the Agent:** Run the training loop, monitoring the agent's performance over time.  Adjust hyperparameters as needed.
5. **Evaluate and Refine:** Evaluate the agent's performance using appropriate metrics and refine the game environment, reward function, or RL algorithm as necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm can be challenging.  Start with default values and iteratively adjust based on performance.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or unexpected behavior.  Careful consideration is necessary to ensure the reward function accurately reflects the desired goals.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project provides hands-on experience with the core concepts of reinforcement learning, including agents, environments, rewards, and policy optimization.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Participants will gain practical experience using a popular reinforcement learning library (Stable Baselines3) to build and train an AI agent.
