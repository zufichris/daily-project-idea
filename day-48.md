# Automated Bug Triage System Prototype

## Overview
This project aims to build a prototype of an automated bug triage system that analyzes bug reports (e.g., from a bug tracking system's API) and categorizes them based on severity and potential root cause using natural language processing (NLP). This helps prioritize bug fixing efforts, improving software development efficiency.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- spaCy (NLP library)
- A suitable bug tracking system API (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) -  focus on a publicly available API for simplicity.
- Flask or FastAPI (for a simple web interface, optional)


## Features & Requirements
- **Bug Report Ingestion:** Fetch bug reports from a chosen bug tracking system's API.
- **Severity Classification:** Categorize bugs as "Critical," "High," "Medium," or "Low" based on keywords and report description analysis.
- **Root Cause Prediction:**  Identify potential root causes (e.g., "Frontend," "Backend," "Database") using NLP techniques and pre-defined categories.
- **Data Output:** Present the categorized bug reports in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- **Basic Reporting:**  Provide summary statistics (number of bugs per category).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Sentiment analysis of bug reports to identify frustrated users, integration with a chatbot for initial bug report acknowledgement.


## Implementation Steps
1. **API Integration:** Set up authentication and retrieve bug report data from the chosen API.  Focus on a small sample dataset initially.
2. **NLP Model Training (Simplified):**  Use spaCy's pre-trained models or create a simple rule-based system for severity classification and root cause prediction based on keywords. A small, focused training set is crucial for a one or two day project.
3. **Categorization Engine:** Develop the core logic to process bug reports and assign categories based on the NLP model's output.
4. **Data Output:** Implement the chosen output format (e.g., write categorized data to a CSV file).
5. **(Optional) Web Interface:** Create a simple Flask/FastAPI app to visualize the categorized results.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Data Quality:** API responses might not be consistently formatted, requiring robust error handling.
- **NLP Model Accuracy:** Rule-based systems or simplified training might not capture all nuances in bug reports; focus on high-impact keywords initially.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with API integration and data manipulation.
- Application of NLP techniques for text classification and information extraction.
- Reinforcement of efficient project planning and prioritization within time constraints.
