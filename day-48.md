## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with onboard sensor capabilities)
* **Programming Language:** Arduino C++
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE
* **Tools:**  Data acquisition tool (e.g., a smartphone camera), dataset labelling tool.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Acquisition:**  The system should capture accelerometer and gyroscope data from the microcontroller's onboard sensors.
- **Gesture Classification:**  A TensorFlow Lite Micro model should classify predefined gestures (e.g., swipe up/down, wave, circle).
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Basic integration with simulated smart home devices (e.g., turning on/off a virtual light through serial communication).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Gesture recognition and actuation should occur with minimal latency.
- **Model Optimization:** The model should be optimized for size and speed to run efficiently on the microcontroller.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Add support for multiple users by training a multi-class model or employing user-specific calibration.
- **Optional Feature:** Implement a visual feedback mechanism (e.g., an LED indicator) to confirm gesture recognition.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect accelerometer and gyroscope data for different gestures using the onboard sensors and a smartphone to record the data. Preprocess this data (e.g., windowing, feature extraction).
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow Lite Micro's tools and the preprocessed data.  Focus on a small, efficient model.
3. **Model Conversion & Deployment:** Convert the trained model to a TensorFlow Lite Micro format compatible with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. Deploy the model to the microcontroller.
4. **Integration with Smart Home Simulation:**  Develop simple code to translate gesture classifications into commands for simulated smart home devices (e.g., sending serial commands to a virtual device).
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system and refine the model or data preprocessing steps as needed to improve accuracy and performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Dataset Size:**  Limited data might hinder model accuracy.  Focus on data augmentation techniques to address this.
- **Real-time Constraints:**  Balancing model accuracy with real-time processing requirements on a low-power microcontroller can be challenging.  Consider model pruning or quantization techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Development:**  Gain practical experience in developing and deploying machine learning models for resource-constrained devices.
- **Sensor Data Processing:**  Improve skills in acquiring, processing, and interpreting sensor data for embedded systems.
