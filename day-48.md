# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, real-time hand gesture recognition system for controlling smart home devices.  The system will utilize a webcam and a lightweight machine learning model to recognize a small set of predefined gestures, triggering corresponding actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).  This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of creating responsive and intuitive smart home interfaces using readily available technology.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow Lite (or similar lightweight ML framework), MediaPipe (optional, for faster gesture detection)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, Computer (with sufficient processing power)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (or IDE of choice)

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, pointing finger).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Action Triggering:** Execute predefined commands (e.g., sending HTTP requests to control smart home devices) based on recognized gestures.
- **Model Training (Optional):**  Train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using a small dataset of hand gesture images.
- **GUI (Advanced):** Develop a basic graphical user interface (GUI) to display recognized gestures and control settings.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:**  Acquire a small dataset of images representing the chosen hand gestures (30-50 images per gesture should suffice). Alternatively, leverage a pre-trained model from MediaPipe.
2. **Model Training (Optional):** Train a lightweight CNN model using the acquired data (or use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it).  If using MediaPipe, skip this step.
3. **Real-time Processing:** Integrate the trained model (or MediaPipe solution) with OpenCV to process webcam feed and detect gestures in real-time.
4. **Action Triggering:** Implement logic to send appropriate commands based on detected gestures (e.g., using a simple HTTP request library).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system, adjust parameters (e.g., model thresholds), and refine gesture recognition accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy with a small dataset and lightweight model can be challenging.  Consider employing data augmentation techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and speed for real-time processing might require careful model selection and optimization.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project strengthens the understanding of image processing, feature extraction, and model deployment.
- **Practical experience with lightweight machine learning:**  This project provides hands-on experience with deploying and utilizing a machine learning model in a real-time application.
