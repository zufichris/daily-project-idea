# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping using a pre-built game engine and a readily available RL library.  This allows for exploration of RL concepts within a constrained timeframe. The game's simplicity will allow for quick iteration and observation of the agent's learning process.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Game Engine:** Pygame (for simplicity and rapid prototyping)
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (provides various RL algorithms)
- **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Logic:** A simple game like "Catch the falling objects" (player controls a paddle to catch falling objects).
- **RL Agent:** An agent trained using a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) to maximize its score.
- **Training Loop:** An implementation to train the agent over a defined number of episodes.
- **Visualization:** Basic visualization of the game and the agent's actions (e.g., using Pygame's display functions).
- **Performance Metrics:** Tracking the agent's score and other relevant metrics over training episodes.

- **Advanced Features:** Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN) for comparison.
- **Optional Feature:** Adding a simple GUI to control training parameters.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Create the basic game structure in Pygame. Define game objects (paddle, objects), movement logic, and scoring system.
2. **Environment Wrapper:** Create a Gym-compatible environment wrapping the Pygame game. This allows seamless integration with Stable Baselines3.
3. **Agent Training:** Choose an RL algorithm (PPO recommended for simplicity) and train the agent using Stable Baselines3.
4. **Visualization & Evaluation:** Visualize the game and plot the agent's performance metrics (score over episodes).
5. **Analysis & Refinement:** Analyze the agent's performance and adjust training parameters (learning rate, number of episodes, etc.) for improvement.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Game Complexity:**  The game needs to be simple enough for rapid development yet challenging enough to showcase the RL agent's capabilities.  Consider starting with a very simple version and iteratively adding complexity.
- **Reward Function Design:** Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for effective agent training. A poorly designed reward function might lead to unexpected behavior. Experimentation will be key.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of RL concepts like agents, environments, reward functions, and training loops.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Hands-on experience using Stable Baselines3 and integrating it with a custom game environment.
