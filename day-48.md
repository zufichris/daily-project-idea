# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures.  The system will demonstrate a multi-modal interface, combining the ease of voice control with the precision of gesture recognition, offering a more intuitive and flexible control mechanism.  The focus will be on a functional prototype rather than a polished user interface.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyAudio (audio input), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi GPIO control, if using a physical appliance)
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi, a smart lamp/fan, USB microphone, webcam.  If hardware is unavailable, a simulated appliance interface can be used.


## Features & Requirements
- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to simple voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," and "Increase lamp brightness."
- **Gesture Control:** The system should recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., hand waving for on/off, a pinching gesture for brightness control).
- **Appliance Feedback:** The system should provide visual or audio feedback confirming the execution of commands (e.g., printing a confirmation message to the console, or changing the LED on the Raspberry Pi).
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle unrecognized voice commands or gestures.
- **Multi-modal Interaction:** The system should allow for a seamless transition between voice and gesture control.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a cloud-based platform for remote control and data logging.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Support for multiple appliances.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries and configure the hardware (if using). Set up a virtual environment for project isolation.
2. **Voice Control Implementation:** Integrate SpeechRecognition to process audio input, convert speech to text, and map commands to appliance control functions.
3. **Gesture Recognition Implementation:**  Use MediaPipe to detect hand gestures from webcam input. Map detected gestures to corresponding appliance control functions.
4. **Appliance Interface:** Create a simulated interface or utilize the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to control a physical appliance. Implement feedback mechanisms.
5. **Integration and Testing:** Combine voice and gesture control modules, thoroughly test the system with various commands and gestures, and refine error handling.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Speech and Gesture Recognition:**  Real-world conditions can introduce noise and variability impacting recognition accuracy.  Consider using robust error handling and potentially adding voice/gesture confirmation steps.
- **Hardware Limitations (if applicable):**  The limitations of the chosen hardware (e.g., processing power, camera resolution) may affect the system's performance.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of skills in integrating multiple libraries and APIs within a single application.
- Practical experience in building a multi-modal human-computer interaction system.
