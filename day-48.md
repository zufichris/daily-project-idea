# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified self-balancing robotic arm controlled using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The goal is to create a small-scale prototype capable of maintaining a stable upright position despite external disturbances. This project emphasizes practical implementation of PID control, a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems.  The scope is limited to a single degree of freedom (vertical balance) for completion within a day or two.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization and control input), NumPy (for numerical computation), a suitable robotics simulation library like PyBullet or V-REP (optional, for a simulated environment).
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A small servo motor, Arduino or Raspberry Pi microcontroller (for physical implementation).  This is optional and the project can be completed using only simulation.

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balance:** The robotic arm should maintain a stable upright position when initially placed.
- **Disturbance Response:** The arm should recover from small external disturbances (simulated or physical).
- **PID Tuning Interface:**  A simple interface (e.g., sliders in Pygame) should allow adjusting PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) in real-time.
- **Visual Feedback:**  Real-time visualization of the arm's angle and PID controller output.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the arm's angle and control signals over time for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Setup:** Create a simplified dynamic model of the robotic arm (equations of motion) considering only the vertical axis. If using simulation, import the necessary robotic arm model into the simulation environment. If using hardware, establish communication with the microcontroller.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID control algorithm in Python. The algorithm will take the arm's current angle and desired angle as input and calculate the control signal (servo motor angle).
3. **Interface Development (Pygame):** Create a Pygame window to visualize the arm's position, display PID gains, and allow users to adjust the gains using sliders.
4. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate the PID controller, model, and interface. Test the system's responsiveness to disturbances by applying simulated forces or manually disturbing the arm (if using hardware).
5. **Tuning & Refinement:** Fine-tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal stability and response.  Experiment with different gain values and observe the system's behavior.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments.  Start with low gain values to avoid instability.
- **Simulation vs. Reality:** If using hardware, there might be discrepancies between the simulated model and the actual physical system due to friction and other factors.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of PID control:** This project provides hands-on experience designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller, a critical skill in robotics and control systems.
- **Develop proficiency in using simulation tools and hardware interfacing:**  The project can be completed using only simulation, offering valuable experience in using tools like PyBullet, or extended to a hardware implementation, enhancing skills in microcontroller programming and sensor interfacing.
