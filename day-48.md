# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm. The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts within a limited timeframe. The game will be text-based to minimize development time, allowing for concentration on the AI implementation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for optional graphical interface)
- Reinforcement learning libraries (e.g., Stable Baselines3)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Game Mechanics:** A simple turn-based game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe with variations or a simplified version of Connect Four).
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An AI opponent using a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm to learn optimal strategies.
- **Training Loop:** A function to train the AI agent against a random opponent or itself.
- **Game Evaluation:** Metrics to track the AI's performance (e.g., win rate, average reward).
- **Basic User Interface:**  A text-based interface for human interaction.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  A graphical user interface using Pygame.  Hyperparameter tuning for the RL algorithm.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Game Logic:** Create the core game mechanics and rules in Python. Include functions to determine game states, valid moves, and win conditions.
2. **Implement Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement it to interact with the game environment. Define state space, action space, reward function, and learning parameters.
3. **Develop Training Loop:** Design a loop to train the agent, allowing for multiple games to be played against a random opponent or itself (self-play).  Log performance metrics.
4. **Create Basic UI:** Implement a simple text-based interface to interact with the game and view the AI's moves.
5. **(Optional) Add Graphical Interface:** Integrate Pygame to create a visual representation of the game.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Defining an effective reward function that guides the AI towards optimal strategies can be challenging. Careful consideration of appropriate rewards for wins, losses, and draws is crucial.
- **State Space Complexity:** Balancing a simple game with enough complexity to make the RL problem interesting yet solvable within the time constraint will require careful design choices.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning).
- Understanding the key components of a reinforcement learning system (environment, agent, reward function, policy).
- Experience in rapid prototyping and iterative development.
