# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to design and implement a self-balancing robotic arm using a simplified model and PID control. The goal is to create a system that can maintain a specific angle despite external disturbances, showcasing fundamental robotics control principles. This is a scaled-down version suitable for rapid prototyping within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pygame (for visualization),  control (for PID control)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A small servo motor, Arduino (for motor control â€“ advanced feature),  breadboard, jumper wires.  (Simulation can be done without physical hardware).


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The robotic arm should maintain a specified target angle (e.g., 45 degrees) using a PID controller.
- **Angle Sensing:**  The arm's angle will be tracked using simulated sensor readings (initially).
- **Motor Control (Simulated):**  The PID controller will output control signals to adjust the simulated motor to maintain the target angle.
- **Visualization:**  A simple graphical representation of the arm's movement using Pygame.
- **Stability Analysis (Optional):**  Basic logging of angle and control signals to analyze the system's performance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Simulation Setup:** Create a simplified model of the robotic arm using NumPy. This model should simulate the arm's dynamics (angle, angular velocity).
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a PID controller using the `control` library in Python to calculate control signals based on the error between the target angle and the current angle.
3. **Simulation Loop:**  Create a simulation loop using Pygame to update the arm's angle based on the PID control signals and visualize the movement.  Display the current angle, target angle, and control signal.
4. **Parameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve stable and responsive balancing.  Experiment with different gain values.
5. **(Optional) Hardware Integration:** If hardware is available, integrate the Arduino code to control the servo motor based on the PID output.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains for stable and quick response can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The simplified simulation may not perfectly reflect the real-world dynamics of a physical robotic arm.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:**  This project reinforces the understanding and application of PID controllers in a practical context.
- **Robotics Simulation:**  Participants will gain experience creating and using simulations to test and refine robotic control algorithms before implementing them on physical hardware.
