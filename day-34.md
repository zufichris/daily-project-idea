# Self-Calibrating Robotic Arm Gripper

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple robotic arm gripper with a self-calibration mechanism. The gripper will autonomously adjust its grip based on the object's size and shape, eliminating the need for pre-programmed settings for different objects.  This is a simplified version, focusing on a single degree of freedom for a single day's work. The significance lies in demonstrating a basic but functional self-calibration algorithm applicable to more complex robotic manipulation tasks.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Robotics Framework:** Robot Operating System (ROS) -  a simplified implementation may skip full ROS usage.
* **Hardware:** A small robotic arm (e.g., a hobbyist kit with servo motors), a force sensor (optional, but highly recommended), and a microcontroller (Arduino or similar).
* **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computations), potentially a ROS client library if using ROS.


## Features & Requirements

- **Automatic Grip Adjustment:** The gripper should automatically adjust its grip strength and width based on the object's dimensions.
- **Object Detection (Simplified):**  A rudimentary object detection method (e.g., using a simple vision system like a camera and thresholding for basic shape/size detection).  Can be replaced with manual object placement for a simpler implementation.
- **Force Feedback (Optional):** Integrate a force sensor to ensure a secure grip without crushing delicate objects.
- **Calibration Algorithm:** Implement a simple algorithm to determine optimal grip based on sensor readings (vision or force).
- **Basic Motor Control:** Precise control of the servo motors for gripper actuation.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the servo motors, force sensor (if used), and camera (if used) to the microcontroller and computer.
2. **Sensor Integration:** Write code to read data from the sensors (force sensor readings, camera images for object detection).
3. **Calibration Algorithm Development:** Create a simple algorithm that uses the sensor data to adjust the servo motor positions. This could be a rule-based system or a very simple machine learning approach.
4. **Control Loop Implementation:**  Integrate the calibration algorithm into a control loop to continuously monitor and adjust the grip.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the gripper with various objects of different sizes and shapes, refining the calibration algorithm as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:**  Sensor readings can be noisy, requiring filtering or other noise reduction techniques.  Simple moving averages might suffice for a basic prototype.
- **Algorithm Complexity:** Finding a balance between algorithm complexity and implementation time within the daily constraint.  Overly sophisticated algorithms should be avoided.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Embedded Systems Programming:** Gain experience in controlling hardware components and interfacing with sensors.
- **Practical Application of Control Algorithms:** Develop and test a simple control algorithm for a robotic system, reinforcing concepts of feedback and control.
