#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using a pre-trained machine learning model.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and integration, leveraging existing libraries to minimize development time. The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of computer vision and machine learning in robotics within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow Lite (machine learning inference), a drone control library (e.g., DroneKit-Python for DJI drones, or a suitable library for your chosen drone platform).
* **Hardware:** A miniature drone with a camera (e.g., a DJI Tellos, or a similar platform), a computer (for processing), and potentially a wireless communication system.

## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Feed Acquisition:**  Capture video frames from the drone's camera.
- **Object Detection:**  Use a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5 Lite) to identify obstacles (e.g., walls, objects) in the video frames.
- **Obstacle Distance Estimation:**  Estimate the distance to detected obstacles using depth estimation techniques (if camera allows) or simple perspective-based calculations.
- **Drone Control:** Implement basic drone maneuvers (e.g., ascend, descend, turn) based on the detected obstacles.
- **Emergency Stop:** Incorporate an emergency stop mechanism to prevent crashes in case of unexpected events.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a path planning algorithm for navigating around multiple obstacles.
- **Optional Feature:** Display the detected obstacles and drone trajectory in a real-time visualization window.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Calibration:** Connect the drone to the computer, configure the camera feed, and test the basic drone controls.
2. **Object Detection Integration:** Integrate a pre-trained object detection model into the code.  Load the model and use it to process the camera feed, detecting obstacles.
3. **Obstacle Distance & Avoidance:** Implement a simple obstacle avoidance logic based on the detected obstacle distances and positions.
4. **Drone Control Integration:**  Integrate the avoidance logic with the drone control commands.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system in a controlled environment (e.g., a room with obstacles), refine the parameters of the avoidance logic as needed, and perform iterative testing.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Real-time Processing:**  Processing the camera feed and controlling the drone in real-time can be computationally intensive, requiring optimization.
- **Accuracy of Object Detection & Distance Estimation:**  The accuracy of the pre-trained model might vary depending on the environment and lighting conditions. This will directly affect the success of the obstacle avoidance.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of:** Computer vision techniques, particularly object detection.
- **Gain experience with:** Integrating pre-trained machine learning models into real-time robotic systems.
