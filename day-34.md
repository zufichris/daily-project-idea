# Real-time Object Tracking & Classification with OpenCV

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV.  The system will detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within a video stream from a webcam, classifying its presence or absence within the frame.  This is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications ranging from robotics to autonomous driving.  The daily challenge focuses on efficient implementation and optimization for real-time performance.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  Webcam, IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Processing:**  The system should process video from a webcam at a reasonable frame rate (at least 10-15 FPS).
- **Object Detection:** The system should reliably detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) within each frame using color thresholding or a more sophisticated method like Haar cascades (for simpler objects).
- **Object Tracking:**  Once detected, the system should track the object's movement across frames using techniques like optical flow or a simple bounding box tracking.
- **Classification:** The system should classify whether the target object is present or absent in the current frame.
- **Visualization:**  The system should display the video stream with the detected and tracked object highlighted (e.g., bounding box).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a more robust object tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) for smoother tracking.  Introduce a different object detection method (e.g., YOLOv5 for more complex objects) if time permits.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy). Set up the webcam connection.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a function to detect the target object using color thresholding or a suitable pre-trained classifier.  This involves defining appropriate color ranges or loading a cascade classifier.
3. **Object Tracking:** Choose a tracking method (optical flow or bounding box tracking) and integrate it with the detection. This involves tracking the object's position across consecutive frames.
4. **Classification & Visualization:**  Classify object presence based on detection results. Overlay the bounding box around the tracked object on the video stream and display the frame rate.
5. **Testing & Optimization:** Test the system with various video inputs and optimize for real-time performance (adjusting threshold values, improving algorithm efficiency).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time performance:** Achieving a smooth frame rate can be challenging, especially with computationally intensive algorithms. Optimization techniques (e.g., reducing image resolution, using more efficient algorithms) may be needed.
- **Robustness to variations:**  The detection and tracking system may struggle with variations in lighting, object size, or background clutter.  Addressing this requires careful selection of parameters and potentially more sophisticated algorithms.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of OpenCV:**  Practical application of OpenCV functionalities for video processing, object detection, and tracking.
- **Develop skills in real-time systems:**  Learn about the challenges of developing applications that require processing data in real-time and strategies for optimizing performance.
