# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic mini-game using reinforcement learning.  The chosen game will be a variation of "Catch the Falling Objects," where the agent must control a paddle to catch falling objects of varying sizes and speeds. The purpose is to demonstrate a practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms and explore strategies for optimizing agent performance within a limited timeframe.  This project emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative development.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar like RLlib)
* **Game Engine:** Pygame (for simplicity and rapid prototyping)
* **IDE:** VS Code (or preferred IDE)

## Features & Requirements

- **Falling Objects:**  The game generates falling objects with varying sizes, speeds, and point values.
- **Paddle Control:** The AI agent controls a horizontally moving paddle to catch the falling objects.
- **Reward System:**  The AI receives positive rewards for catching objects and negative rewards for missing them, scaled by object size and speed.
- **Game Over:** The game ends after a predefined number of objects or when the agent fails to catch a certain number of objects consecutively.
- **Score Tracking:** The AI's score is tracked and displayed.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Object Prediction (anticipate object landing points), Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:**  Create the game environment using Pygame.  This includes setting up the game window, the paddle, and object generation logic.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO from Stable Baselines3). Define the state space (paddle position, object positions and speeds) and action space (paddle movement).
3. **Training:** Train the AI agent using the defined reward system. This step might involve hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance within the time constraint.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance by running several episodes and analyzing its score and behavior.
5. **Refinement (Optional):**  If time permits, implement advanced features or tune hyperparameters for better performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen reinforcement learning algorithm within the limited timeframe can be challenging. A good starting point with pre-defined parameters is recommended.
- **Reward Shaping:**  Designing an effective reward system that guides the agent towards optimal behavior is crucial. Experimentation might be necessary to find a balance between rewarding and punishing actions.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Practical Application:**  Gain hands-on experience implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent for a simple game environment.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization:** Develop a better understanding of how hyperparameter tuning impacts the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.
