# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp, fan, or coffee maker) using a combination of voice commands and hand gestures. This project focuses on rapid prototyping and leverages readily available APIs and libraries to demonstrate the integration of different input modalities for enhanced user interaction.  The significance lies in exploring a more intuitive and accessible control method for smart home devices.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `pyaudio` (for audio input), `speech_recognition` (for speech-to-text), `opencv-python` (for computer vision and gesture recognition),  `requests` (for API communication with the smart appliance).
* **Hardware:**  A microphone, a webcam, and a compatible smart home appliance with an accessible API (e.g., a Philips Hue lamp, a smart plug with an API).  A Raspberry Pi or a decent laptop will suffice.
* **Optional:**  A pre-trained gesture recognition model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or MediaPipe).


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should accurately recognize voice commands (e.g., "Turn on the lamp," "Set brightness to 50%").
- **Gesture Control:** The system should detect simple hand gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, hand-up for brightness increase) using the webcam.
- **Appliance Integration:** The system should seamlessly integrate with a chosen smart home appliance's API to execute the commands.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle speech recognition errors and API communication failures.
- **User Interface:** A simple terminal-based interface displaying the current status and commands executed.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementing a fallback mechanism if either voice or gesture recognition fails (e.g., using a combination of both or defaulting to a simple on/off toggle).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integration with a cloud-based platform (like AWS IoT or Google Cloud IoT) for remote control and data logging.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and test the microphone and webcam functionality.
2. **Implement Voice Recognition:** Integrate `pyaudio` and `speech_recognition` to capture audio, convert it to text, and parse the commands.
3. **Implement Gesture Recognition:** Use OpenCV to capture video frames, preprocess them, and detect predefined gestures (or use a pre-trained model for faster development).
4. **Integrate with Smart Appliance API:**  Establish communication with the chosen smart appliance API using the `requests` library to send control commands based on voice and gesture input.
5. **Combine and Test:** Integrate the voice and gesture components, add error handling, and thoroughly test the system with various commands and gestures.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech and Gesture Recognition:**  Real-world noise and variations in gesture execution can affect accuracy.  Consider using robust error handling and potentially more sophisticated recognition models.
- **API Limitations:**  The chosen smart appliance might have limited API functionalities or rate limits. Thoroughly review the API documentation to understand its capabilities and limitations.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Interaction Design:**  This project reinforces understanding of integrating multiple input methods (voice and gesture) for user interaction.
- **API Integration:**  This project provides hands-on experience integrating with external APIs and handling API requests and responses.
