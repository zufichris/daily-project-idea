# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple calibration system for a robotic arm using a computer vision technique.  The goal is to accurately map the robot's joint angles to its end-effector position in 3D space without relying on pre-programmed kinematic models. This is useful for quick setup and recalibration of robotic arms, particularly in dynamic environments where precise positioning is critical.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computing), potentially a robotic arm library (e.g., PySerial for serial communication)
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm with controllable joints and end-effector, a calibrated camera (webcam or DSLR), a marker (e.g., a colored ball) attached to the end-effector.

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera using a standard chessboard pattern to obtain intrinsic and distortion parameters.
- **Marker Detection:** Detect the marker (colored ball) in each camera frame using OpenCV's color filtering and blob detection.
- **Position Estimation:** Calculate the 3D coordinates of the marker relative to the camera using the camera calibration parameters and marker's pixel coordinates.
- **Data Acquisition:** Collect multiple data points of joint angles and corresponding 3D marker positions.
- **Simple Calibration Model:**  Implement a simple linear regression or nearest neighbor model to map joint angles to 3D positions.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a more sophisticated calibration model (e.g., polynomial regression) for higher accuracy.
- **Optional Feature:**  Visualize the calibration data and the resulting calibration model in a 3D plot.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function to calibrate the camera using a chessboard pattern.
2. **Marker Detection & Position Estimation:** Implement a function to detect the marker in each frame and convert its pixel coordinates to 3D world coordinates.
3. **Data Acquisition:**  Write a script to control the robotic arm, move it to several different positions, capture images from the camera, and record the corresponding joint angles and calculated 3D marker positions.
4. **Calibration Model Training:**  Train a simple linear regression or nearest-neighbor model to map joint angles to 3D positions using the collected data.
5. **Validation:** Test the accuracy of the calibration model by moving the robot to new positions and comparing the predicted and actual 3D positions of the marker.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of marker detection:**  Lighting conditions and background clutter can affect the accuracy of marker detection.  Experiment with different color filtering and blob detection parameters.
- **Calibration model complexity:** Choosing an appropriate calibration model is crucial for accuracy and computational efficiency.  Start with a simpler model and consider more complex models if needed.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques (camera calibration, object detection, 3D position estimation).
- Gain practical experience in applying machine learning (regression) for robotic arm calibration.
