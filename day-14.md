# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will capture hand gestures via a webcam and translate them into commands to control the appliance's state (on/off, brightness/speed). This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and machine learning in a smart home context.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand gesture recognition),  requests (for API interaction, if controlling a cloud-connected appliance).
* **Tools:**  Python IDE (PyCharm, VS Code), Webcam.
* **Optional:**  A smart home hub API documentation (e.g., ifPhilips Hue, IFTTT).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:**  The system should accurately detect and classify pre-defined hand gestures (e.g., open hand for "on," closed fist for "off," thumbs up for "increase brightness").
- **Appliance Control:** Successful gesture recognition should trigger corresponding actions on the chosen smart appliance.
- **User Interface:** A simple window displaying the detected gesture and the appliance's current state.
- **Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle cases where gestures are not recognized or the appliance is unavailable.
- **Calibration:**  An initial calibration step to adjust the system's sensitivity to different hand sizes and lighting conditions.

**Advanced Features:**
- **Multiple Appliance Control:** Extend to control multiple appliances with different gestures.
- **Gesture Training:** Allow the user to train the model with custom gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Initialization:** Install necessary libraries, set up the webcam, and create the basic UI window.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and classify pre-defined gestures.
3. **Appliance Control Logic:** Implement the logic to translate recognized gestures into commands to control the chosen smart appliance (either directly via its API or simulating control).
4. **UI Updates:** Update the UI to reflect the recognized gesture and the appliance's current status.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various hand gestures and lighting conditions, and refine the gesture recognition model or thresholds as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of gesture recognition. Robust solutions might involve background subtraction or lighting compensation techniques.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Some gestures might be easily confused.  Careful selection of gestures and potentially more advanced classification algorithms (e.g., CNNs) could improve accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  Experience integrating and applying a real-time computer vision library like MediaPipe for a tangible application.
- **Developing a Real-Time Control System:**  Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and testing a system that responds to real-time input.
