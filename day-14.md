# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a rudimentary self-balancing robotic arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller. The arm will maintain a near-vertical position despite external disturbances, demonstrating a basic implementation of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control. This is a valuable exercise in real-time control systems and sensor integration.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 for advanced features).
* **Servo Motor:**  A standard hobby servo with sufficient torque.
* **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):**  An MPU6050 or similar.
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Libraries:**  Servo library, MPU6050 library.
* **Tools:** Soldering iron, breadboard, jumper wires, 3D printer (optional for a custom arm).

## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain a roughly vertical position despite small pushes or disturbances.
- **Sensor Integration:** Accurate reading of angle data from the IMU is crucial.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A functional PID controller is the core of the project.
- **Real-time Feedback Loop:** The system should continuously read sensor data and adjust the servo accordingly.
- **Stability Analysis (Optional):**  Evaluate system stability under various conditions.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a simple motor encoder to improve accuracy,  Incorporate a Bluetooth module for remote control.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU and servo motor to the microcontroller according to datasheets. Test the servo and IMU readings individually.
2. **IMU Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Calibrate the IMU to obtain accurate angular readings. Write code to read and display the angle data from the IMU.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a basic PID controller algorithm using the angle error as input and the servo position as output. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) experimentally.
4. **Feedback Loop Integration:**  Integrate the PID controller into a loop that continuously reads IMU data, calculates the error, adjusts the servo accordingly and then repeats.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system's stability under various disturbances and refine the PID gains for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative experimentation.  Use techniques like Ziegler-Nichols method.
- **IMU Noise:** IMU readings can be noisy, requiring filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) to improve accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing a PID controller for a real-world system.
- **Sensor Integration:** Learn how to integrate sensors (IMU) with a microcontroller and process the sensor data effectively.
