# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, game and train a reinforcement learning agent to play it effectively within a short timeframe.  The game will be a variation of a classic game, making it easy to understand and implement while still allowing for the exploration of reinforcement learning concepts.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and observing the learning process, rather than creating a highly polished game.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- Pygame (for game development and visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game (e.g., a simplified version of Snake, Pong, or a custom grid-based game).
    - A basic reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler algorithm).
    -  A training loop that allows the agent to learn and improve its game play over a set number of iterations.
    -  Visualization of the game and the agent's performance (e.g., score over time).
    -  Saving and loading trained agent models.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Exploration vs. Exploitation strategy tuning (e.g., Îµ-greedy).
    -  Implementing a slightly more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network if time permits).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Design & Implementation:** Design and implement the core game mechanics using Pygame. Keep the game rules simple and the state space relatively small to ease the RL implementation.
2. **Agent Design:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (start with Q-learning). Define the state and action spaces for the agent.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement the training loop.  This involves repeatedly running the game, having the agent make decisions, receiving rewards, and updating the agent's policy based on the chosen algorithm.
4. **Visualization and Evaluation:** Visualize the game and track the agent's performance metrics (e.g., score, average reward). Experiment with hyperparameters if time allows.
5. **Saving & Loading:** Implement functionality to save and load trained agent models for later use or comparison.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent towards desired behavior can be tricky.  Experimentation and iteration are key here.
- **Computational Resources:** Depending on the chosen algorithm and game complexity, training might take some time.  Consider limiting the training iterations for a daily challenge.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces understanding of fundamental reinforcement learning concepts like Q-learning, state-action spaces, reward functions, and exploration/exploitation trade-offs.
- Practical experience in applying RL techniques to a real-world (albeit simplified) problem, including the iterative process of training, tuning, and evaluating an agent.
