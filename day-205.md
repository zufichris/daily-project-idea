# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project involves creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.  The game will include a visual representation of the board and the AI's decision-making process, highlighting the evaluated game states.  This provides a practical application of a fundamental AI algorithm and allows for easy visualization and understanding of the algorithm's workings.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for graphics and user interface), NumPy (optional, for array manipulation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A playable Tic-Tac-Toe game with a human player and an AI opponent.
    -  An AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
    -  A visual representation of the game board using Pygame.
    -  Clear indication of the current player's turn.
    -  Win/Lose/Draw conditions clearly displayed.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Visualization of the Minimax search tree (partially or simplified for a daily challenge).
    -  Difficulty levels (adjusting the search depth of the Minimax algorithm).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the game board and display:** Create the game board using Pygame, including drawing the grid and handling user input for placing X's and O's.
2. **Implement the Minimax algorithm:** Develop a recursive function that evaluates game states, applying the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI.
3. **Integrate AI with the game loop:**  Incorporate the Minimax function into the game loop, allowing the AI to make moves based on the current board state.
4. **Add win/lose/draw conditions:** Implement logic to check for win, lose, and draw scenarios and display the appropriate message.
5. **(Optional) Implement visualization:** If time allows, add basic visualization of the Minimax tree or at least highlight the AI's considered moves on the board.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax implementation:** Correctly implementing the recursive Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning (optional optimization) can be challenging.  Careful testing and debugging will be necessary.
- **Efficient visualization:**  Visualizing the Minimax tree in a clear and understandable way within a daily timeframe might require simplification or focusing on key aspects of the search.


## Learning Outcomes

-  Reinforcement of the Minimax algorithm and its application in game AI.
-  Practical experience with game development using Pygame, including event handling and game loop design.
