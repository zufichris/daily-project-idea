# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it effectively within a day or two.  The game will be sufficiently simple to allow for quick implementation and training, yet complex enough to demonstrate the core principles of RL. The significance lies in showcasing the power of RL in creating AI agents capable of learning complex strategies without explicit programming.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 or RLlib
- **Game Engine (Optional):** Pygame (for visualization, otherwise CLI-based)
- **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Game Mechanics:** A simple 2D game, like a variation of Snake or a simplified version of Pac-Man (e.g., navigating a maze to collect items).
- **RL Agent Integration:**  The RL agent will learn to play the game through trial and error, maximizing a reward function (e.g., points collected, survival time).
- **Training and Evaluation:** Implement a training loop to allow the agent to learn and a separate evaluation loop to assess its performance.
- **Data Logging:** Record key metrics during training (e.g., reward, steps taken) for analysis and visualization.
- **Basic Visualization:** (Optional)  Use Pygame to display the game and agent's actions in real-time (not essential for a minimal viable product).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Design & Implementation:** Design the core game mechanics using a simple framework (e.g., Pygame) or a CLI-based representation.  Focus on a minimal, functional version.
2. **Environment Definition:** Define the game environment for the RL agent, ensuring it provides clear observations (game state), actions, and rewards.
3. **Agent Selection & Training:** Choose an appropriate RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) from Stable Baselines3 or RLlib and configure the hyperparameters for a short training session (e.g., 1-2 hours).
4. **Evaluation & Analysis:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance on the game. Analyze the recorded data to assess learning progress and identify potential improvements.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** Based on the evaluation, iterate on the game design, RL algorithm, or hyperparameters to improve the agent's performance if time allows.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm might require some experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust based on the initial training results.
- **Reward Function Design:** Carefully crafting the reward function is crucial for guiding the agent's learning.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to unintended behavior.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like agents, environments, rewards, and different RL algorithms.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Gain hands-on experience using a popular RL library (Stable Baselines3 or RLlib), understanding its APIs, and applying it to a concrete problem.
