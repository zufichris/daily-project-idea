# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Robot Arm

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a basic system for real-time object detection and tracking using a robotic arm.  The goal is to enable the robot arm to identify and follow a specific object (e.g., a colored ball) within its workspace.  This provides a simplified but effective demonstration of computer vision integration with robotics.  The focus will be on a functional prototype, not high-precision performance.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, a suitable robotic arm control library (e.g., for a specific arm model, potentially ROS if the arm supports it), TensorFlow Lite or a similar lightweight model for object detection.
- **Hardware:**  A robotic arm (physical or simulated), a camera (preferably with good frame rate).

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across frames.
- **Arm Control:**  Move the robotic arm to a position above or near the detected object.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Implement basic checks for object detection failures (e.g., object out of view).
- **Visualization:** Display the camera feed with bounding boxes around the detected object and arm position overlay.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more robust tracking algorithm handling occlusions and rapid movements.
- **Optional Feature:** Add distance estimation to allow for precise positioning of the arm relative to the object.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries, connect to the robotic arm, and calibrate the camera. Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a MobileNet SSD model).
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement a loop that continuously captures frames from the camera, performs object detection using the model, and tracks the object's centroid across frames using OpenCV's tracking functions.
3. **Arm Control:**  Based on the tracked object's position, calculate the necessary arm movements using inverse kinematics (simplified approach might be sufficient for this scope). Send commands to the robotic arm to move accordingly.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and the arm's calculated position onto the camera feed for visual feedback.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system with the target object and refine parameters (e.g., detection thresholds, arm movement speed) as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing of camera frames and object detection might be computationally intensive. Consider optimizing the object detection model and utilizing hardware acceleration if available.
- **Robotic Arm Control Complexity:**  The complexity of robotic arm control will depend on the specific arm and the control library used.  Simplified kinematics might be necessary for a 1-2 day project.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical experience:** Integrating computer vision and robotics, combining image processing algorithms with robotic arm control.
- **Skill enhancement:**  Strengthening skills in real-time image processing, object detection and tracking, and robotic control.
