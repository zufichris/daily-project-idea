# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a traffic light system that dynamically adjusts its timing based on simulated traffic density.  The goal is to create a simplified model that can optimize traffic flow and reduce wait times.  This is a valuable exercise in applying control algorithms and data visualization in a practical context.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for visualization)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)


## Features & Requirements
- **Traffic Density Simulation:** Simulate vehicle generation and movement on multiple lanes, representing traffic flow.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light system with adjustable cycle times.
- **Optimization Algorithm:** Utilize a simple optimization algorithm (e.g., a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller or a rule-based system) to adjust the traffic light timing based on detected traffic density.
- **Data Visualization:** Display the simulated traffic flow and traffic light states visually using Pygame.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track and display key metrics such as average wait time and throughput.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated optimization algorithm like Q-learning or another reinforcement learning approach.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add different types of vehicles (e.g., emergency vehicles) with priority handling.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Simulation Setup:** Create the basic simulation environment using Pygame.  This includes defining roads, lanes, and generating vehicles randomly.
2. **Traffic Light Implementation:** Implement a simple traffic light controller with fixed cycle times.
3. **Density Detection:** Develop a mechanism to detect traffic density on each lane (e.g., counting vehicles within a certain area).
4. **Optimization Algorithm Integration:** Integrate the chosen optimization algorithm to adjust the traffic light timing based on the detected density.
5. **Visualization and Metrics:** Display the simulation visually using Pygame and track relevant performance metrics.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm Tuning:** Finding the optimal parameters for the chosen optimization algorithm might require experimentation and iterative adjustments.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** Balancing simulation simplicity with realistic traffic behavior can be challenging.  A simplified model will be sufficient for this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces understanding of control systems and optimization algorithms.
- Develops skills in data visualization and simulation using Python and Pygame.
