# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simple, yet engaging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to create a playable prototype demonstrating the core principles of reinforcement learning within a short timeframe.  This allows for a quick exploration of AI techniques and iterative improvement.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow)
- NumPy
- A suitable game library (e.g., Pygame for visualization, optional)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An AI opponent trained using a Q-learning algorithm.
    - Ability to play against the AI.
    - Basic win/loss/draw detection.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    -  Graphical User Interface (GUI) for improved user experience using a library like Pygame.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Define the game rules and create functions for game state representation, move execution, and win/loss/draw condition checks.  Choose Tic-Tac-Toe for faster development.
2. **Q-Learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm with appropriate reward functions (e.g., +1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for a draw).
3. **Training the AI:** Train the AI agent by letting it play against itself numerous times. The number of iterations will depend on time constraints.  Start with a simpler approach.
4. **Game Integration:** Integrate the trained AI into the game, allowing a human player to compete against it.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Play several games against the AI, identify weaknesses and refine the training process or reward function as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Training Time:**  The time required for sufficient training to achieve reasonable AI performance might be a constraint within the short timeframe.  Start with fewer training iterations and progressively improve.
- **Reward Function Design:** Designing an effective reward function that encourages optimal play can be challenging.  Experimentation and iterative adjustment are key.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Understanding the key concepts of Q-learning (states, actions, rewards, Q-values).
- Experience with iterative development and refinement of AI algorithms.
