# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robotics

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype of an AI-powered image caption generator specifically tailored for robotic perception.  The generated captions will be concise, descriptive, and suitable for robotic decision-making, focusing on object identification, location, and relevant attributes for navigation or manipulation tasks. This is distinct from general-purpose image captioning, demanding precision and context relevant to robotics.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (deep learning), Transformers (for pre-trained language models like BERT or similar), NLTK (natural language toolkit - optional for advanced features)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (for development), a suitable pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from Hugging Face model hub).

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Input:** Accepts an image (e.g., from a robot's camera) as input.
- **Object Detection & Classification:**  Accurately identifies and classifies objects within the image.
- **Caption Generation:** Generates a concise caption describing the detected objects, their location (e.g., "a red ball is located on the table"), and relevant attributes (e.g., size, shape).
- **Output Formatting:**  Provides the output in a structured format (e.g., JSON) suitable for robotic systems.
- **Real-time Processing (Optional):**  Processes images with minimal latency for real-time applications.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Model Selection:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and choose a pre-trained image captioning model from a repository (Hugging Face is recommended). Consider models optimized for object detection and localization.
2. **Image Preprocessing:** Implement image preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization) as required by the chosen model.
3. **Caption Generation Pipeline:** Integrate the chosen model to generate captions from the preprocessed images. Focus on handling the output to extract relevant information.
4. **Output Formatting & Testing:** Structure the output into a JSON format containing object details and locations. Test the pipeline with sample images.
5. **(Optional) Real-time Integration:** If time permits, explore integrating the pipeline with a simulated robot environment or a live camera feed for real-time testing.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the chosen pre-trained model might not be perfect for all scenarios. Carefully evaluate the model's performance on relevant image datasets. Consider fine-tuning if necessary, although this may be beyond a one-day scope.
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing with complex models can be computationally expensive. Optimize the pipeline and consider using efficient model architectures if real-time performance is targeted.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of Deep Learning Pipelines:**  The project reinforces the practical application of deep learning models for computer vision tasks within a robotics context.
- **Experience with Robotic Perception:**  The project provides valuable experience in integrating AI models for robotic perception, focusing on practical challenges of data formatting and model selection for specific robotic tasks.
