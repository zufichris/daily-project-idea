# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a rudimentary self-balancing robotic arm using a micro-controller and sensor feedback, implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for stabilization. The goal is to demonstrate a simplified version of a complex control system within a short timeframe, focusing on efficient PID tuning techniques.  The significance lies in understanding and applying PID control – a core concept in robotics and automation.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 for more advanced features).
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Sensors:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU – accelerometer and gyroscope).
* **Actuator:** Servo motor(s) for arm movement.
* **Software:** Arduino IDE, potentially a PID tuning library.


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balance:** Maintain the arm in a roughly upright position using the IMU feedback.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  Develop and tune a PID controller for angle stabilization.
- **Sensor Data Visualization:**  Display sensor readings (angle, angular velocity) in real-time on a serial monitor.
- **Manual Control (Optional):** Allow for simple manual control of the arm’s angle through serial commands.
- **Angle Setpoint (Advanced):** Implement the ability to set a target angle for the arm to maintain.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the microcontroller according to datasheets.
2. **Sensor Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Write code to read IMU data (angle and angular velocity) and calibrate for offsets.
3. **Basic PID Implementation:**  Implement a simple PID controller with initial gain values. Observe the system response.
4. **PID Tuning:** Systematically adjust the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal stability and response time. This may involve using a systematic approach like Ziegler-Nichols.
5. **Data Visualization & Testing:** Display sensor readings and arm angle on the serial monitor to observe system behavior and fine-tune the PID parameters.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments and careful observation of system responses.  Oscillations and instability are potential issues.
- **Sensor Noise:** The MPU6050 might produce noisy data.  Implementing a low-pass filter might be necessary to improve stability.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning PID controllers.
- **Sensor Integration & Data Processing:** Develop skills in interfacing with sensors, acquiring data, and performing basic signal processing.
