# AI-Powered Text Summarization Microservice

## Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight microservice capable of summarizing text input using a pre-trained transformer model.  The focus is on speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications requiring concise summaries of short to medium-length texts.  This is significant because concise summaries are crucial in many applications like news aggregation, chatbots, and document review.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** FastAPI (for the microservice)
- **Library:** Transformers (from Hugging Face, for the summarization model)
- **Deployment:** Docker (optional, for easy deployment and portability)


## Features & Requirements
- **Text Input:** Accept text input via a REST API endpoint.
- **Summarization:** Generate a concise summary of the input text using a pre-trained summarization model.
- **Output Formatting:** Return the summary in JSON format, including the original text length and summary length.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for invalid input or model failures.
- **Performance Logging:** Log API requests and response times for monitoring and optimization.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement different summarization model selection (e.g., offering a choice between different model sizes for varying accuracy/speed trade-offs).
- **Optional Feature:** Add a configurable maximum summary length parameter.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (FastAPI, Transformers). Select a suitable pre-trained summarization model from Hugging Face's model hub.
2. **API Development:** Create a FastAPI endpoint that accepts text input, processes it using the chosen summarization model, and returns the summary in JSON format.
3. **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement error handling for invalid input and exceptions during model processing. Integrate a simple logging mechanism to track API requests and performance metrics.
4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the API with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially problematic text formats.
5. **Dockerization (Optional):** Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment and portability.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model that balances accuracy and inference speed is crucial.  Experimentation may be required.
- **Resource Management:**  Efficient memory management is important, especially when handling larger text inputs.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of microservice architecture and REST API design using FastAPI.
- Gain practical experience using pre-trained transformer models for natural language processing tasks, specifically text summarization.
