# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a basic real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module.  The system will identify a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera's field of view and track its movement, displaying its location on the screen. This project emphasizes efficient implementation and practical application of computer vision techniques within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar), Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2, power supply.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (optional for faster inference), a suitable IDE (Thonny, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display a bounding box around the detected object on the camera feed.
- **Position Reporting:** Print the object's coordinates (x, y) to the console.
- **FPS Measurement:** Display the frames per second (FPS) of the processing.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a simple prediction algorithm to anticipate the object's future position (optional, may require more time).
- **Multiple Object Tracking:** Extend to detect and track multiple instances of the same object (optional, adds complexity).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite if using). Connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Object Detection:**  Implement a simple color-based object detection using OpenCV's thresholding and contour detection functions for the pre-defined object.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's `cv2.track` functions (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`, `cv2.TrackerKCF`) to track the detected object across frames.
4. **Visualization & Reporting:** Display the camera feed with bounding boxes around the tracked object and report its coordinates and FPS to the console.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and object movements. Adjust parameters for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the FPS, especially with more complex object detection models. Optimize code for speed and consider using TensorFlow Lite for faster inference.
- **Lighting Variations:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect color-based object detection. Explore techniques to handle these variations, such as adaptive thresholding.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience in implementing real-time object detection and tracking algorithms.
- **Resource Management:** Learn to optimize code and manage resources effectively on a resource-constrained device like the Raspberry Pi.
