# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Controller Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a simplified traffic light system that uses a machine learning algorithm to dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle density. The goal is to minimize overall wait times and improve traffic flow.  This provides a practical demonstration of reinforcement learning applied to a real-world problem within a manageable timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Libraries:  NumPy, Matplotlib,  gym (OpenAI Gym or a similar reinforcement learning framework), a simple Reinforcement Learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).


## Features & Requirements
- **Traffic Simulation:** Simulate vehicle arrival at intersections using a random process (Poisson process).
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller with adjustable timing for each phase.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Develop an agent using a chosen RL algorithm that learns to optimize traffic light timings based on the simulated traffic density.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track average wait times and throughput (vehicles passing through the intersection).
- **Visualization:**  Visualize the simulation using Matplotlib (traffic flow and reward).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporate different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, buses) with varying speeds and priorities.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a more sophisticated reward function that accounts for factors beyond simple wait times (e.g., fuel consumption).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Environment:** Create the basic traffic simulation environment.  Define the intersection, vehicle generation parameters, and initial traffic light timing.
2. **Implement the RL Agent:** Choose an RL algorithm and implement it to interact with the simulation environment. Define the state space (traffic density at each approach), action space (traffic light timings), and reward function.
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the simulation and train the RL agent for a pre-defined number of episodes. Monitor the performance metrics (average wait times and throughput).
4. **Visualize Results:** Use Matplotlib to visualize the simulation, traffic flow, and the agent's learning curve (reward over time).
5. **Analyze and Refine:**  Analyze the results. Adjust parameters of the simulation, RL algorithm, or reward function if needed to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that accurately reflects the desired behavior (minimizing wait times) can be challenging. Experimentation and iterative refinement are crucial.
- **Computational Cost:**  The training process might be computationally intensive depending on the chosen RL algorithm and the complexity of the simulation.  Consider simplifying the simulation or using a less complex RL algorithm if needed.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning principles and implementation (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
- Design and implementation of a simulation environment.
- Evaluating and optimizing the performance of a machine learning model in a dynamic environment.
