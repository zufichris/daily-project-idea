# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a quick and efficient calibration procedure for a robotic arm using computer vision.  Instead of relying on manual calibration methods, this project will utilize a camera to identify pre-defined markers on the arm's workspace and automatically adjust the robot's internal coordinate system to accurately reflect its physical position. This is significant because precise calibration is crucial for reliable robotic operation, especially in tasks requiring high accuracy. A simplified version can be completed within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm library (e.g., ROS for more advanced systems, or vendor-specific libraries).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, low-cost one), a webcam or camera, a set of uniquely identifiable markers (e.g., colored circles or ArUco markers).

## Features & Requirements

- **Marker Detection:** The system must accurately detect and locate pre-defined markers in the camera's field of view using OpenCV.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Calculate the transformation matrix between the camera coordinate system and the robot's base coordinate system using detected marker positions.
- **Robot Arm Control:**  Interface with the robotic arm to send commands based on the calculated transformation.  Move the arm to a known position based on camera vision and verify accuracy.
- **Calibration Report:** Generate a report containing the calculated transformation matrix and the error metrics.
- **User Interface:** A simple graphical interface (e.g., using Tkinter or a similar library) allowing for marker placement instructions and calibration initiation.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Real-time feedback displaying the robot's current pose estimate.
- Self-calibration capabilities, where the system automatically determines optimal marker positions for optimal calibration.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Marker Detection & Tracking:** Implement OpenCV functions to detect and track the pre-defined markers in the camera feed.  Use a simple approach (e.g., color thresholding for colored markers or ArUco library for ArUco markers).
2. **Coordinate System Setup:** Define coordinate systems for the camera and robot base. Use detected marker positions in pixel coordinates and their known real-world locations to establish the transformation.  A simple homography estimation can be sufficient.
3. **Robot Arm Control Integration:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move to a specific coordinate based on the transformation and detected marker positions. This might require using a specific robotic arm library.
4. **Calibration Accuracy Verification:** Move the robotic arm to pre-defined points and compare the actual position to the commanded position using the camera feed. Report the error.
5. **UI Development (Optional):** Create a simple graphical interface to manage the calibration process (marker placement confirmation, calibration initiation and result display).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accurate Marker Detection:** Lighting conditions and marker orientation can affect detection accuracy. Robust image processing techniques may be needed (e.g., noise reduction, improved thresholding).
- **Camera Calibration:** Camera intrinsic parameters (focal length, distortion coefficients) may be required for accurate 3D position estimation.  A simple approach might assume a pinhole camera model and neglect distortion for a minimal viable product.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience in image processing, feature detection, and coordinate transformation.
- **Robotics Control Principles:** Understanding the basics of robotic arm control and calibration procedures.
