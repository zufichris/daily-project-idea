# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured using a standard webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures performed near the camera and trigger corresponding actions within a simulated smart home environment.  This is significant because it explores a less-invasive, more intuitive user interface for smart home interaction compared to voice or touch-based methods.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  PyAutoGUI (for simulating keyboard/mouse inputs),  possibly a simple MQTT broker for communication with a simulated smart home environment.
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with Python and the necessary libraries installed.

## Features & Requirements

- **Hand Detection & Tracking:** Real-time detection and tracking of hands using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognition of at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g.,  a "thumbs up" for turning on lights, a "thumbs down" for turning them off, a "fist" for pausing music).
- **Smart Home Simulation:** Simulate basic smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, controlling music playback) using PyAutoGUI.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Visual feedback on the screen indicating recognized gestures.
- **Calibration:**  Simple calibration to adjust for different hand sizes and lighting conditions.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple User Support:**  Distinguish between multiple users based on hand features.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a custom model for more complex gesture recognition using a small dataset of custom gestures.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Hand Tracking:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and implement real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe.
2. **Gesture Definition & Recognition:** Define three distinct micro-gestures and develop simple logic to recognize them based on hand landmark positions.
3. **Smart Home Action Simulation:**  Implement functions to simulate smart home actions based on recognized gestures using PyAutoGUI.
4. **Real-time Feedback Integration:** Display visual feedback on the screen indicating which gesture was recognized and the corresponding action taken.
5. **Calibration (Optional):**  Implement a basic calibration procedure to account for variations in hand size and lighting conditions.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in hand poses, lighting, and camera angles.  This requires careful selection of key landmarks and robust error handling.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing the video stream and performing gesture recognition in real-time can be computationally intensive. Optimization of the code is crucial.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on experience with computer vision:**  This project provides practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time object detection and tracking.
- **Reinforcement of basic machine learning concepts:**  Even the simple gesture recognition involves aspects of pattern recognition and decision-making, building foundational ML understanding.
