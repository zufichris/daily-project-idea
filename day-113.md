# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a quick and efficient calibration method for a robotic arm using a computer vision system.  Accurate calibration is crucial for precise robotic manipulation, and this project focuses on a streamlined approach suitable for rapid prototyping and testing.  The goal is to achieve accurate end-effector positioning relative to a target object using readily available tools.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, PySerial depending on the arm's interface).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple one), a camera (webcams are sufficient), a checkerboard pattern or other easily identifiable markers.

## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera to obtain intrinsic parameters (focal length, distortion coefficients).
- **Marker Detection:** Detect and locate a calibration marker (checkerboard) in the camera's field of view.
- **Robotic Arm Movement Control:** Control the robotic arm to move to specific target coordinates based on marker detection and inverse kinematics.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Transform the marker's coordinates from the camera frame to the robot's base frame.
- **Accuracy Verification:** Verify the accuracy of the calibration by commanding the arm to reach multiple points and measuring the errors.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple user interface for easier interaction and parameter adjustments.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Incorporate iterative refinement of the calibration based on error measurements.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera()` function with images of the checkerboard pattern to obtain camera parameters.
2. **Marker Detection:**  Use OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners()` to detect the checkerboard in real-time camera feed.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Determine the transformation matrix between the camera and robot coordinate systems using known physical dimensions and the detected marker position.
4. **Arm Control & Verification:** Send commands to the robotic arm to reach points calculated from the transformed marker coordinates. Measure the actual arm position and compare it to the target.
5. **Refinement (Optional):**  If significant errors exist, implement an iterative correction algorithm based on the error measurements.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accurate Coordinate Transformation:** Determining the transformation matrix accurately requires precise knowledge of the camera and robot's relative positions.  Careful measurements and potentially multiple calibration points are needed.
- **Robot Arm Dynamics:**  Accounting for the arm's inertia and limitations in speed and acceleration can be challenging for accurate control.  Simpler movements should be prioritized initially.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of camera calibration techniques in computer vision.
- Gain practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic control systems.
