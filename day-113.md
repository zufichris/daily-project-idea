# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a micro-gesture recognition algorithm.  The system will utilize a computer vision library to recognize simple hand gestures performed in front of a webcam, triggering predefined smart home actions. This project focuses on rapid prototyping and showcases the potential of computer vision for intuitive human-computer interaction in smart environments.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe
- **Framework:**  None (script-based)
- **Tools:**  Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., wave, fist, thumbs up) with a reasonable accuracy.
- **Action Mapping:**  Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., wave = turn on lights, fist = increase volume, thumbs up = pause music).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **User Interface:** A simple visual feedback mechanism showing the recognized gesture and the triggered action (e.g., command line output).
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Record the gestures and corresponding actions for later analysis and improvement of the model.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Incorporate a simple background subtraction technique to improve robustness against changing backgrounds.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Implement a small training/calibration step to adjust gesture recognition to the user's specific hand movements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).  Test webcam connectivity.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe's hand detection and tracking capabilities.  Focus on extracting key landmarks for gesture classification.
3. **Gesture Classification:**  Develop a simple logic (e.g., if-else statements) to classify the detected hand landmarks into predefined gestures.  Thresholds for landmark positions may need to be adjusted empirically.
4. **Action Triggering:**  Implement the mapping between recognized gestures and smart home actions (this can be simulated; no actual smart home integration is required).
5. **User Interface:** Create a basic visual output to demonstrate the system's functionality.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy with a limited number of gestures and a simple classifier. Address this by focusing on distinct and easily recognizable gestures.  Experiment with different threshold values.
- **Robustness:** Dealing with variations in lighting, hand size, and background conditions. Background subtraction can help mitigate some of these issues.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision basics:**  Working with OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand tracking.
- **Develop practical skills in gesture recognition:** Learn to extract meaningful features from image data and build a simple gesture classification system.
