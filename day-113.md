# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple prototype for controlling smart home devices using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus is on rapid prototyping, achieving basic functionality within a short timeframe.  This project showcases real-time computer vision and its application in a practical context.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe
- **Framework (Optional):**  Streamlit for a simple UI (optional for time constraints)
- **Hardware:** Webcam


## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Detection:**  Recognize at least two distinct hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up for "on," thumbs down for "off").
- **Device Control Simulation:**  Simulate turning a virtual light or fan on/off based on the detected gestures.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Accuracy Metrics:**  Display a basic accuracy metric (e.g., percentage of correctly recognized gestures).
- **Video Input:** The system should successfully process a live video stream from the webcam.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Multiple device control (lights, fan, etc.), gesture calibration for user customization.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).  Test webcam functionality.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe's hand detection and tracking model to identify hand landmarks.
3. **Gesture Classification:**  Develop a simple logic to classify the detected hand landmarks into predefined gestures (e.g., using distance between specific landmarks).
4. **Device Control Simulation:** Create a basic function to simulate controlling a virtual device (e.g., printing "Light ON/OFF" to the console) based on the classified gesture.
5. **Real-time Integration and UI (Optional):** Integrate the gesture recognition with the webcam feed and optionally create a simple UI using Streamlit to display the results and accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition with limited training data might be challenging.  Consider simplifying the gestures to improve robustness.
- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing with complex models can be computationally expensive.  Optimizing the code and simplifying the gesture recognition model are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Gain practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and object detection.
- **Model Application and Optimization:**  Learn how to apply pre-trained models (MediaPipe) and optimize for a specific application with resource constraints.
