# Real-time Object Recognition and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a basic real-time object recognition and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera.  The system will identify predefined objects (e.g., a red ball, a specific person's face) within the camera's field of view and track their movement, displaying the results overlaid on the live camera feed. This project is significant as it provides a foundation for various applications, including robotics, security systems, and automated processes.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Raspberry Pi:**  Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar) with a camera module.
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for object detection model).
- **Object Detection Model:** A pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model (e.g., MobileNet SSD).


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system should accurately detect predefined objects in the camera feed at a reasonable frame rate (at least 5-10 FPS).
- **Object Tracking:** The system should track the detected objects' movement across frames, providing continuous location updates.
- **Visual Feedback:** The system should display bounding boxes around detected objects on the live camera feed.
- **Object Classification:**  The system should identify the class of the detected object (e.g., "red ball," "person").
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record object positions and classifications over time for further analysis.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a simple user interface to select objects for tracking and adjust parameters.  Integrate with a robotic arm for basic object manipulation.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Installation:** Set up the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite), and download a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Object Detection Integration:** Integrate the chosen object detection model into the OpenCV pipeline.  This involves loading the model and using it to detect objects in each frame from the camera.
3. **Object Tracking Implementation:** Implement a simple object tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.Tracker` functions) to follow detected objects across frames.
4. **Visual Feedback and Display:** Overlay bounding boxes and object labels on the live camera feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various objects and lighting conditions.  Adjust parameters (e.g., model thresholds) for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Resources:**  The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the frame rate and the complexity of the object detection model. Using a lighter model is crucial.
- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Object detection and tracking can be affected by lighting changes, occlusion, and object variations.  Experimenting with different models and parameters might be needed to improve accuracy and robustness.


## Learning Outcomes
- This project reinforces practical skills in real-time image processing using OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite.
- It provides hands-on experience with object detection and tracking algorithms, highlighting the challenges of working with real-world data and limited computational resources.
