# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home appliance control system using a combination of voice recognition and hand gesture recognition.  The system will allow users to control a single appliance (e.g., a smart lamp) through voice commands and simple hand gestures, demonstrating a multimodal user interface.  The significance lies in exploring the integration of different input modalities for improved usability and accessibility in smart home environments.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyAudio, SpeechRecognition (for voice), OpenCV, MediaPipe (for gesture), RPi.GPIO (if using a Raspberry Pi for physical control)
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi,  USB microphone, webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Turn the appliance ON/OFF using voice commands ("Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the lamp").
- **Gesture Control:** Turn the appliance ON/OFF using predefined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for ON, closed fist for OFF).
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Provide visual feedback (e.g., LED indicator on a Raspberry Pi, or on-screen display) reflecting the appliance's status.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle voice recognition errors and invalid gestures.
- **Configuration:** Allow for customization of voice commands and gesture recognition thresholds.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement brightness control via voice ("Set lamp to 50%") or gesture (hand height).
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a home automation platform (e.g., Home Assistant) for broader appliance control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure hardware (if using).
2. **Voice Recognition Implementation:** Integrate SpeechRecognition to recognize predefined voice commands and trigger corresponding actions.
3. **Gesture Recognition Implementation:** Use OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and classify hand gestures, mapping them to appliance control actions.
4. **Appliance Control:**  Implement the logic to interface with the chosen appliance (simulated or physical). This might involve sending commands over a network or directly controlling GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.
5. **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement the visual or auditory feedback system to confirm successful commands and show the appliance status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of recognition:** Voice and gesture recognition can be susceptible to noise and variations in user input.  Consider using robust algorithms and techniques to improve accuracy.
- **Hardware limitations:** If using a Raspberry Pi, resource constraints might need careful consideration for real-time processing of both audio and video streams.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal interaction design:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing systems that utilize multiple input modalities.
- **Real-time image and audio processing:**  Develop skills in working with real-time streams and applying computer vision and speech recognition techniques.
