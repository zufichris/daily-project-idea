# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control via Neural Network

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple self-balancing robotic arm controlled by a lightweight neural network.  The goal is to create a system where the arm maintains its balance despite external disturbances, using a simplified model for rapid prototyping.  This demonstrates fundamental concepts in robotics control and reinforcement learning in a manageable timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization/simulation), NumPy (for numerical computation), a lightweight neural network library (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile).
* **Hardware (Optional):** A small robotic arm (e.g., a DIY kit) and associated microcontroller/sensors (if aiming for physical implementation, otherwise simulation is sufficient).

## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain an upright position, compensating for simulated or real-world disturbances (e.g., small pushes).
- **Neural Network Control:** A simple neural network will act as the controller, taking sensor readings (angle, angular velocity) as input and outputting motor commands.
- **Simulation Environment:**  A simplified 2D simulation using Pygame will be sufficient for the daily challenge.
- **Training Mechanism:**  A basic reinforcement learning approach (e.g., Q-learning) will be used to train the neural network.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log training data for analysis and visualization.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Install necessary libraries and set up the simulation environment using Pygame (or connect to physical hardware). Create a simplified model for the robotic arm's dynamics.
2. **Neural Network Design:** Design and implement a small, shallow neural network architecture suitable for control.  Keep the architecture simple (e.g., a single hidden layer).
3. **Reinforcement Learning Implementation:** Implement a simple Q-learning algorithm to train the neural network. Define rewards for maintaining balance and penalties for falling.
4. **Training and Testing:** Train the network in the simulation environment. Observe its performance and adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate) as needed.
5. **Visualization & Evaluation:** Visualize the arm's behavior in the simulation, recording performance metrics (e.g., time balanced, total reward).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Simulation Accuracy:**  The simplified model might not perfectly reflect the dynamics of a real robotic arm.  This could lead to discrepancies between simulated and real-world performance.
- **Training Stability:**  Reinforcement learning algorithms can be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Finding stable training parameters might require experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Understand the basic principles of reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning.
- **Neural Network Applications:** Gain practical experience in applying neural networks for control systems in robotics.
