# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, yet challenging, 2D game (e.g., Pong or a simplified version of Snake) and implement a basic AI opponent using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating a functional RL agent within a day or two. This provides a practical application of RL concepts without requiring extensive data collection or complex model training.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch) for RL implementation.
- Tools:  A suitable code editor (VS Code, PyCharm), Python virtual environment.


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A functional 2D game environment (e.g., Pong with simplified controls).
    - An AI opponent controlled by a simple RL agent (e.g., Q-learning).
    - Basic game scoring and display.
    - A training loop to allow the AI to improve over time.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Visualisation of the Q-table or RL agent's policy.
    -  Exploration-exploitation trade-off adjustments (epsilon-greedy).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create a basic 2D game using Pygame. Focus on a minimal but playable game environment.  (Estimate: 2 hours)
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning). Design the state space, action space, and reward function for the game. (Estimate: 3 hours)
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that allows the RL agent to interact with the game environment, learn from its actions, and update its policy. (Estimate: 3 hours)
4. **Testing and Evaluation:** Test the AI agent against a human player or a simple rule-based opponent. Evaluate its performance based on win rate and game score. (Estimate: 2 hours)
5. **Optional: Visualization:**  If time allows, visualize the Q-table or the RL agent's policy for better understanding of the learning process. (Estimate: 2 hours)

## Challenges & Considerations

- **State and Action Space Design:**  Choosing appropriate state and action representations that balance complexity and learning efficiency can be challenging.  Experiment with different representations to find a suitable balance.
- **Reward Function Design:**  Designing a reward function that effectively guides the RL agent's learning is crucial. A poorly designed reward function may lead to unexpected behaviour.  Consider a simple reward function initially, then refine as needed.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like Q-learning, state-action spaces, reward functions, and the training loop.
- **Game Development Basics:** This provides experience in building a simple game using Pygame, incorporating AI, and understanding the interaction between AI and game mechanics.
