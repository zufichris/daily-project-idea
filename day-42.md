# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web browser and WebRTC.  The system will capture video from a user's webcam, detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball), track its movement within the frame, and display bounding boxes and potentially trajectory information on the video stream. This demonstrates a basic yet functional application of computer vision and real-time communication technologies.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js potentially for server-side components if chosen)
- **Framework/Library (Frontend):** TensorFlow.js or similar for object detection; WebRTC API for video streaming.
- **Framework/Library (Backend - Optional):** Node.js with Express.js (if implementing a server for video stream processing).
- **Tools:**  A web browser (Chrome recommended), a webcam.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Acquire video stream from the user's webcam using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the video frame using TensorFlow.js's pre-trained model or a simple custom model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Visualization:** Display bounding boxes around the detected object on the video stream.
- **Performance Monitoring (Optional):**  Display FPS (frames per second) to assess the system's performance.

- **Advanced Features:** Trajectory prediction (simple linear prediction); Object counting.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the WebRTC connection:** Establish a connection to the user's webcam using the WebRTC API and display the video stream in a canvas element.
2. **Implement Object Detection:** Integrate TensorFlow.js (or a similar library) to perform object detection on each frame of the video stream.  Use a pre-trained model for speed or a simpler custom model for a focused challenge.
3. **Implement Object Tracking:** Utilize a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Visualize Results:** Draw bounding boxes around the detected object on the video canvas.
5. **(Optional) Add Performance Monitoring:** Calculate and display the frames per second (FPS) to measure the system's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:**  Real-time object detection and tracking can be computationally intensive.  Choosing a lightweight model and optimizing code is crucial for smooth performance. Consider simplifying the object detection task (e.g., detecting a specific color rather than a complex object).
- **Handling Occlusion:** The tracking algorithm needs to robustly handle situations where the object is temporarily occluded (hidden). Implementing a mechanism to re-identify the object after occlusion is an advanced challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **WebRTC Implementation:** Gain practical experience in using the WebRTC API for real-time video streaming.
- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Learn how to apply computer vision techniques (object detection and tracking) in a real-time context using TensorFlow.js.
