# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a traffic light system capable of dynamically adjusting its timings based on real-time traffic flow data.  The goal is to create a simplified, yet functional simulation that can demonstrate the principles of self-optimization and adaptive control in traffic management.  This is a valuable exercise for understanding algorithms and data structures applied to real-world problems.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for visualization)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A simple data structure (e.g., list, dictionary) to represent traffic flow.


## Features & Requirements
- **Traffic Flow Simulation:** Simulate vehicles moving through intersections with varying speeds and densities.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller with customizable cycle times.
- **Real-time Data Acquisition (Simplified):**  Simulate real-time data input using random number generation to represent vehicle counts at each approach.
- **Adaptive Cycle Adjustment:** Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., proportional controller) that adjusts the traffic light timings based on simulated traffic flow data.  Longer green lights for heavier traffic.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the traffic flow and traffic light states using Pygame.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., fuzzy logic or a neural network, if time permits, using a small dataset).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a simple user interface to control simulation parameters (e.g., vehicle generation rate).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pygame, NumPy).  Create a basic Pygame window for visualization.
2. **Implement traffic flow simulation:** Create classes to represent vehicles and intersections.  Generate vehicles randomly and simulate their movement.
3. **Implement basic traffic light control:** Set up a fixed-time traffic light controller.
4. **Implement adaptive control:**  Develop a simple algorithm to adjust traffic light timings based on vehicle counts at each approach.  (Start with a basic proportional controller).
5. **Integrate visualization:** Display the traffic flow and traffic light states in the Pygame window.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm design:** Choosing an efficient and effective algorithm for adaptive traffic light control can be challenging within the time constraint.  A simple proportional controller is a good starting point.
- **Data representation:**  Efficiently representing and manipulating traffic flow data (vehicle positions, speeds, etc.) will be crucial for performance.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of algorithm design and implementation skills, particularly for control systems.
- Practical application of data structures and visualization techniques in a simulated environment.
