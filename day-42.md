# AI-Powered Text Summarization for Technical Documents

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype of an AI-powered text summarization tool specifically designed for technical documents.  The tool will leverage pre-trained transformer models to generate concise and accurate summaries of lengthy technical papers, documentation, or codebases. This is significant because efficient comprehension of technical information is crucial for developers, and automated summarization significantly improves productivity.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.9+
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)
- SentenceTransformers library (Hugging Face)
- Streamlit (for a quick UI)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Functionality:** Input a technical document (text file upload).
- **Summarization:** Generate a concise summary of the input document using a pre-trained summarization model.
- **Adjustable Length:** Allow users to specify the desired length of the summary (e.g., number of sentences or words).
- **Output Format:** Present the summary in a clear and readable format.
- **Model Selection:** Offer a selection of pre-trained models (e.g., different sizes of BART, T5) for users to experiment with.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Integration with a version control system (e.g., GitHub) to automatically summarize commit messages or pull requests.
    -  A basic sentiment analysis component to assess the overall tone of the document.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Model Selection:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and choose a suitable pre-trained summarization model from Hugging Face's model hub.
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Implement functions for cleaning and preparing the input text (handling special characters, removing irrelevant sections etc.)
3. **Summarization Engine:** Integrate the chosen model to generate summaries based on the preprocessed input.
4. **UI Development (Optional):**  If time permits, create a simple Streamlit interface for easier interaction (file upload, length selection, output display).
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Test the summarization with various technical documents, adjusting parameters (e.g., model, length) for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right pre-trained model is crucial for achieving optimal accuracy and efficiency. Experimentation might be necessary.
- **Handling Technical Jargon:**  Technical documents often contain specialized terms that might confuse the summarization model. Techniques like using domain-specific embeddings could be explored (though beyond a two-day scope).


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of pre-trained transformer models for natural language processing tasks.
- Experience in using and integrating libraries like Transformers and SentenceTransformers for text processing and summarization.
-  Strengthening understanding of model selection and parameter tuning in the context of AI applications.
