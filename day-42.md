# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking using a Webcam

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a standard webcam. The system will identify and track a predefined object (e.g., a red ball, a person) within the webcam's field of view. This project provides a practical application of computer vision and serves as a foundation for more advanced projects in robotics and automation.  The focus is on achieving accurate and efficient tracking, even with variations in lighting or object movement.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on pre-trained model choice)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, Computer with sufficient processing power

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect the predefined object in each frame from the webcam feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Continuously track the object's position and movement across frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Display a bounding box around the detected object on the webcam feed.
- **Coordinate Reporting:** Output the object's (x, y) coordinates in real-time.
- **FPS Monitoring:** Display frames per second (FPS) to evaluate performance.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Object classification (identifying multiple object types).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement Kalman filtering for smoother tracking.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch). Choose a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet).
2. **Load Model and Webcam:** Load the chosen object detection model and initialize the webcam feed using OpenCV.
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Process each frame from the webcam, run object detection using the loaded model, and implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., simple centroid tracking or more sophisticated methods).
4. **Visualization and Output:** Overlay bounding boxes and coordinates onto the webcam feed using OpenCV's drawing functions. Display FPS.
5. **Refinement and Testing:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and object movements.  Refine tracking parameters for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally expensive, especially with complex models. Choosing a lightweight model and optimizing the code is crucial.
- **Object Occlusion:** The system might struggle if the target object is temporarily occluded. Implementing occlusion handling techniques could improve robustness.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision concepts:**  Object detection, tracking algorithms, and image processing techniques.
- **Practical application of deep learning models:**  Using pre-trained models for real-world applications and understanding their limitations.
