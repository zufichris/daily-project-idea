# Automated Bug Report Triage System (Prototype)

## Overview
This project aims to create a prototype of an automated system for triaging bug reports.  The system will analyze bug reports (e.g., from a GitHub repository) and automatically categorize them based on severity, area of impact (e.g., frontend, backend, database), and potential root cause.  This can significantly reduce the workload on development teams and speed up the bug fixing process.  This prototype will focus on a limited scope, focusing on a specific project and a smaller subset of potential keywords.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) library (e.g., spaCy or NLTK)
- Regular expressions
- A text processing library (e.g., beautifulsoup4 if parsing HTML/Markdown from Github)
- GitHub API (if pulling data directly from GitHub)

## Features & Requirements
- **Bug Report Ingestion:**  The system should be able to ingest bug reports from a specified source (e.g., a text file, a CSV, or a GitHub issue tracker).
- **Severity Classification:**  The system should classify bug reports into severity levels (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) based on keywords and report descriptions.
- **Area of Impact Identification:**  The system should identify the area of the software impacted by the bug (e.g., frontend, backend, database) using NLP techniques.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Extract key words from the bug report to potentially assist in root cause analysis (e.g., "login failed", "database error").
- **Basic Reporting:** Generate a summary report of the triaged bug reports, categorizing them based on severity and area of impact.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Sentiment analysis of the bug report to understand user frustration level.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a project management tool (e.g., Jira) for automatic ticket creation.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Acquire a sample dataset of bug reports (e.g., from a past project). Clean and preprocess the text data (remove irrelevant characters, convert to lowercase).
2. **NLP Model Development:** Train a simple NLP model (e.g., using spaCy's rule-based matching or a basic classifier) to identify severity levels and areas of impact based on keywords and phrases in the bug reports.
3. **Regular Expression Implementation:** Develop regular expressions to capture key information or error messages from the bug reports.
4. **Report Generation:** Create a function to generate a summary report based on the classified bug reports.
5. **Integration (Optional):** If time allows, attempt integration with a sample GitHub repository or a simplified dummy project management system.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Data Quality:** The accuracy of the triage depends heavily on the quality and consistency of the bug report descriptions.  Addressing noisy data and inconsistencies will be crucial.
- **Model Accuracy:**  Building a highly accurate NLP model in a short time might be challenging.  Focus on a simple, yet effective, approach.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of NLP techniques for text classification and information extraction.
- Experience with building a simple, yet functional, automated system to improve software development workflow.
