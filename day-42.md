# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple self-balancing robot arm controlled using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The goal is to implement a basic PID algorithm to maintain the arm's balance when subjected to disturbances, offering a tangible demonstration of control systems principles. This is a scaled-down version achievable within a day or two, focusing on the core PID implementation and control aspects.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID controller implementation), Pygame (for visualization – optional)
* **Hardware:**  (Optional)  A small, inexpensive servo motor (or simulated servo model) and an Arduino or similar microcontroller (simulation can replace this for a software-only focus).

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balance Control:**  The arm should maintain an upright position when undisturbed.
- **Disturbance Response:**  The arm should recover from small external disturbances (simulated or real).
- **PID Tuning Interface:**  Allow for manual adjustment of PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to observe their impact on stability and response time.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log sensor data (angle, angular velocity) and control signals to analyze performance.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Use Pygame or a similar library to graphically represent the arm's movement.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Creation:** Establish a simplified dynamic model of the robot arm, possibly using a single-link inverted pendulum approximation. This could be entirely simulated.
2. **PID Implementation:** Implement a PID controller in Python using NumPy and SciPy.  Focus on a clear structure enabling easy adjustment of PID gains.
3. **Simulation/Hardware Integration:** If using a physical setup, integrate the controller with your microcontroller and sensor readings (e.g., from an accelerometer or encoder). If simulated, use a numerical integration method to simulate the arm’s motion.
4. **Tuning & Testing:** Experiment with different PID gain values to find an optimal balance between stability and responsiveness.  Record observations.
5. **Data Analysis & Refinement (Optional):** If data logging is implemented, analyze the data to further refine PID gains and controller parameters.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Consider using techniques like Ziegler-Nichols method for initial tuning.
- **Sensor Noise:** If using real hardware, sensor noise can significantly affect the controller's performance. Implement appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average).

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforces understanding of PID control:** This project provides hands-on experience with designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Improves problem-solving skills:** Troubleshooting stability issues and refining the controller through experimentation improves problem-solving abilities in a practical context.
