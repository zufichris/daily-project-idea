# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., wave, thumbs up, thumbs down) and translate them into commands to control smart home devices (simulated in this case). This project focuses on rapid prototyping and showcases efficient real-time image processing techniques.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  a lightweight messaging system (e.g., MQTT for simulated device control)
- **Tools:**  A webcam, Python IDE (PyCharm, VS Code), potentially a virtual environment.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Accurately track hand landmarks from webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize predefined micro-gestures (wave, thumbs up/down) based on hand landmark positions.
- **Command Mapping:** Map recognized gestures to specific smart home commands (e.g., wave = lights on/off, thumbs up = increase volume, thumbs down = decrease volume).
- **Simulated Device Control:**  Simulate the execution of commands (print to console or use a simple MQTT broker to publish messages).
- **User Interface (GUI):** A basic display showing the recognized gesture and corresponding command.

- **Advanced Features:**  Gesture-based control of multiple devices,  dynamic gesture addition/training.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a real smart home system (e.g., Home Assistant) using a suitable API.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, MQTT client if used). Create a project folder and virtual environment.
2. **Hand Tracking & Visualization:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking solution. Display the webcam feed with hand landmarks overlaid.
3. **Gesture Recognition Logic:** Implement logic to recognize predefined gestures based on hand landmark positions and distances.  This could be rule-based or use a simple machine learning model (optional).
4. **Command Mapping & Execution:**  Map recognized gestures to smart home commands and implement the simulation (console output or MQTT message publishing).
5. **GUI Development:** Create a simple GUI (using Tkinter or a similar library) to display the current recognized gesture and executed command.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand position, and occlusion can be challenging. Consider implementing error handling and potentially more sophisticated gesture recognition techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Processing the webcam feed and performing gesture recognition in real-time might require optimization.  Experiment with different image processing techniques for optimal performance.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce practical experience in computer vision techniques (image processing, hand tracking).
- Gain experience in developing real-time applications with constraints on processing speed.  This will hone skills in efficient algorithm design and code optimization.
