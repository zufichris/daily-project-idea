# Minimalist Robotic Arm Path Planning with Obstacle Avoidance

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified path planning algorithm for a robotic arm to reach a target position while avoiding a single, static obstacle. The focus is on efficient implementation and clear visualization, suitable for a short development timeframe. This exercise reinforces core concepts in robotics and pathfinding.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Optional:** ROS (for robotic arm simulation/integration, if time permits)


## Features & Requirements

- **Target Reaching:** The robotic arm should be able to plan and execute a path to a specified target coordinate.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:**  The path must avoid collision with a pre-defined circular obstacle.
- **Visualization:**  Pygame will be used to display the robotic arm, obstacle, target, and planned path in real-time.
- **Simple Arm Model:**  A 2-DOF (degrees of freedom) robotic arm will be simulated, simplifying the kinematics.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a simple smoothing algorithm (e.g., BÃ©zier curves) to make the planned path more aesthetically pleasing and potentially improve robot performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Visualization:**  Set up the Pygame environment. Create visual representations for the robotic arm (two links), obstacle (circle), and target (point).
2. **Basic Path Planning:** Implement a simple path planning algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT* - simplified version).  For a daily challenge, a basic algorithm is sufficient. The algorithm should find a collision-free path from the arm's initial position to the target.
3. **Collision Detection:**  Implement a function to check for collisions between the arm links and the obstacle.  Simple circle-line segment intersection checks should suffice.
4. **Path Execution (Simulation):** Simulate the arm moving along the planned path. Update the arm's visual position at each step.
5. **(Optional) Path Smoothing:**  If time allows, implement a basic smoothing algorithm to refine the planned path.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:** Choosing the right path planning algorithm is crucial.  A simple, yet effective algorithm is key for meeting the daily challenge timeframe.
- **Collision Detection Efficiency:**  Ensuring efficient collision detection is important, especially if path smoothing is implemented.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of path planning algorithms:**  Practical experience with implementing and visualizing a pathfinding algorithm.
- **Application of collision detection techniques:** Hands-on experience implementing and applying collision detection in a robotic simulation.
