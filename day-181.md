# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to create a functional AI that can learn and improve its strategy within a short timeframe, demonstrating fundamental RL concepts.  The significance lies in applying advanced algorithms to a familiar problem, making it accessible and engaging for a daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `gym` (for environment creation, optional), `numpy`, `matplotlib` (for visualization, optional),  `stable-baselines3` (or similar RL library like `tf-agents`)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four with a clear win/loss/draw condition.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  An AI player using a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler policy gradient method).
- **Training Loop:** A function to train the AI agent against a random opponent or itself.
- **Evaluation:** A method to test the AI's performance against a human player or a different strategy (e.g., minimax).
- **Basic Visualization (Optional):**  Plotting the learning curve (reward over time).

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Implement a more advanced RL algorithm like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from `stable-baselines3`.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Allow the user to adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor) to experiment with their impact on learning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment:** Define the game rules and create functions for game state representation, move validation, and win condition checks.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (start with Q-learning for simplicity) and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on its current state and learned policy.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a loop to repeatedly play the game, updating the agent's policy based on the received rewards (win, loss, draw).
4. **Evaluation:**  Test the trained agent against a human player or a simple rule-based AI to assess its performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  Plot the agent's reward over training iterations to visualize the learning process.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Training RL agents can be computationally expensive.  For a daily challenge, keep the game simple and limit the training iterations to manage runtime.  Consider using a less computationally-intensive algorithm for Q-learning or simplifying the state representation.
- **Reward Shaping:**  Carefully design the reward function to encourage optimal behavior; a poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal performance.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project provides hands-on experience with core RL concepts like states, actions, rewards, policies, and the training loop.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Gain familiarity with using Python RL libraries like `stable-baselines3` to build and train AI agents.
