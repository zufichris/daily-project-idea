# Minimalist Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview
This project aims to create a Python-based solver for the inverse kinematics of a 3-DOF robotic arm.  The focus is on a minimalist approach, prioritizing clarity and efficiency over complex features.  This allows for rapid prototyping and a good understanding of core concepts within a short timeframe. The solver will calculate the necessary joint angles to reach a given target Cartesian coordinate. This is a fundamental problem in robotics with broad applications.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy (for optimization, optional)
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Functionality:** Calculate joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) for a given target (x, y, z) coordinate.
- **Link Length Definition:** Allow user input for the length of each robotic arm segment (l1, l2, l3).
- **Solution Output:** Display calculated joint angles in degrees or radians.
- **Error Handling:**  Provide informative error messages for unreachable targets or invalid inputs.
- **Basic Validation:** Check for physically impossible configurations (e.g., exceeding joint limits).


- **Advanced Feature:** Implement an iterative solver (e.g., using Newton-Raphson) to handle more complex arm geometries or configurations with multiple solutions.
- **Advanced Feature:** Visualize the robotic arm and target position using Matplotlib.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Arm Geometry:**  Establish the mathematical model representing the 3-DOF robotic arm using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention or similar.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Algorithm:** Implement a suitable algorithm (e.g., geometric method for a simple 3-DOF arm, or a numerical method like Newton-Raphson for more complexity).
3. **Input and Output:** Create a simple user interface (e.g., command-line input) to accept target coordinates and link lengths, and display the calculated joint angles.
4. **Validation & Error Handling:** Include checks for input validity and physically impossible configurations.  Handle these gracefully with informative error messages.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If time permits, use Matplotlib to visualize the robotic arm and target position for better understanding.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Singularities:**  Addressing singularities where the solution becomes undefined or multiple solutions exist can be challenging. A robust algorithm should handle these cases.
- **Algorithm Choice:** Selecting an appropriate inverse kinematics algorithm (geometric vs. numerical) depends on arm complexity and desired accuracy.  A simpler geometric approach may suffice for a basic 3-DOF arm.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of robotic arm kinematics and the inverse kinematics problem.
- Practical experience in implementing and evaluating different kinematic solving algorithms.
