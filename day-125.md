# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimalistic game using reinforcement learning. The game will be a custom-designed environment, focusing on a core mechanic that can be learned effectively within a short timeframe. The significance lies in understanding and applying reinforcement learning principles in a practical, tangible setting.  This allows for quick iteration and experimentation with different RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 or similar (e.g., RLlib)
- **Game Development Library (Optional but Recommended):** Pygame for a simple visual representation.  Alternatively, a text-based environment can be created.
- **Development Environment:**  VS Code or similar.


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A simple 2D grid-based game where the agent needs to navigate to a target location, avoiding obstacles.  Reward is given for reaching the target and penalties for collisions.
- **Agent Implementation:**  A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
- **Training Loop:**  A training loop to allow the agent to learn the optimal policy through interaction with the environment.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Track the agent's success rate (percentage of successful target reaches) and average steps to reach the target.
- **Basic Visualization (Optional):**  Display the game environment and the agent's progress.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of a different RL algorithm (e.g., A2C).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Adding dynamic obstacles to increase the complexity of the game.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game's rules, rewards, and penalties.  Create the game environment using Pygame (or text-based representation).
2. **Agent Selection & Initialization:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO) from Stable Baselines3 and initialize the agent with appropriate hyperparameters.
3. **Training Loop Implementation:** Create a training loop that interacts with the environment, collects data, and updates the agent's policy.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Implement metrics to track the agent's progress and identify areas for improvement.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If using Pygame, create a visual representation of the environment and the agent's actions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm can be challenging and might require experimentation. Start with default values and adjust based on observation.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior. Careful consideration is needed to ensure the reward function guides the agent towards the desired behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:** Gain practical experience in implementing and training RL agents.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Develop intuition for tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.
