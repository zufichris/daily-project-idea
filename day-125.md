# Smart Home Device Integration via MQTT Broker

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple, extensible Python script that acts as a central hub for integrating various smart home devices using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol.  The goal is to demonstrate a functional prototype capable of receiving and publishing data from simulated sensors and actuators, highlighting the power and flexibility of MQTT for IoT applications.  This is significant because it provides a foundation for building more complex smart home automation systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python 3
* **MQTT Library:** paho-mqtt
* **Data Serialization:** JSON
* **Development Environment:**  VS Code or similar IDE.
* **Optional:** A local MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) â€“ though a cloud-based service could also be used.

## Features & Requirements

- **Simulated Sensor Data Publishing:**  Publish simulated data (temperature, humidity, light level) from three virtual sensors at regular intervals.
- **Actuator Control via MQTT:**  Receive commands via MQTT to simulate the control of a smart light (on/off).
- **Data Logging:** Log all incoming and outgoing MQTT messages to a local file for analysis.
- **Basic Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Allow for manual control of the simulated actuators via the CLI.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for MQTT connection issues and data parsing.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a real-world sensor (e.g., DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Creation of a simple web dashboard using Flask or similar to visualize sensor data.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up MQTT Broker:** Install and configure a local MQTT broker (or use a cloud-based one).
2. **Develop MQTT Client:** Create a Python script using the `paho-mqtt` library to subscribe to and publish messages on pre-defined topics.
3. **Implement Sensor Simulation & Publishing:**  Generate simulated sensor data and publish it to the MQTT broker.
4. **Implement Actuator Control:**  Subscribe to commands for the simulated light and update its state.
5. **Add Data Logging & CLI:** Implement basic logging and command-line functionality.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **MQTT Topic Management:**  Designing a clear and organized topic hierarchy for different devices and data types. Careful planning is crucial for scalability.
- **Error Handling:** Handling potential network issues and ensuring the robustness of the MQTT connection.  Consider reconnection strategies.

## Learning Outcomes

- **MQTT Protocol Understanding:**  Gain practical experience with the MQTT protocol, including publishing and subscribing to messages.
- **IoT System Design:**  Learn about designing and implementing a basic IoT system using a publish-subscribe architecture.
