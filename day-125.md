# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured using a standard webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, up/down, wave) and translate them into commands to control smart home devices (simulated in this prototype). This provides a hands-free and intuitive interaction method, potentially enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation),  PyAutoGUI (for simulated device control), NumPy
* **Tools:**  A standard webcam,  a computer with Python and required libraries installed.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:** The system should accurately detect predefined hand gestures from the webcam feed in real-time.
- **Gesture-to-Command Mapping:**  Each gesture should be mapped to a specific smart home command (e.g., swipe left: decrease smart light brightness, swipe up: increase volume).
- **Command Execution (Simulation):** The system will simulate the execution of commands by printing the action to the console or using PyAutoGUI to control a simple application.
- **User Calibration:** Allow for a short calibration period to adjust the system to individual hand sizes and movement styles.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling to manage situations where gestures are not clearly detected.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple User Support:** Extend the system to recognize multiple users based on their hand characteristics.
- **Customizable Gestures & Commands:** Allow users to define their own gestures and corresponding commands.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries. Set up the webcam and capture a short video sample of the target gestures.
2. **Gesture Detection and Feature Extraction:** Use MediaPipe to process the video stream, extracting hand landmarks and key points. Design simple algorithms to identify relevant gestures based on the landmark positions and their movement.
3. **Gesture Classification and Command Mapping:** Create a mapping between identified gestures and corresponding smart home commands. Implement basic logic to classify gestures based on thresholds and patterns.
4. **Command Execution (Simulation):**  Implement the command execution logic.  This can involve printing the command to the console or using PyAutoGUI to control a simulated smart home application.
5. **User Interface (Optional):**  Develop a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for calibration and command visualization if time allows.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in lighting, hand position, and individual movement styles.  Consider using techniques like smoothing filters and thresholds adjustments.
- **Real-time Processing:** Processing the webcam feed in real-time demands efficient algorithms and data structures. Optimization might be necessary to ensure smooth operation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** This project reinforces the practical application of computer vision techniques for real-world problems.
- **Real-time System Design:**  Building a real-time system necessitates careful consideration of algorithmic efficiency and resource management.
