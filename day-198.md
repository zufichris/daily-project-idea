# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Mobile Robot Simulator

## Overview

This project focuses on integrating real-time object detection and tracking capabilities into a mobile robot simulator.  The goal is to create a basic, yet functional system that can detect and track objects within a simulated environment, providing a foundation for more complex autonomous navigation tasks.  This is significant because robust object detection and tracking are crucial for many robotics applications, and this project allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation in a safe and controlled environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), NumPy (for numerical computation), a suitable robotics simulator API (e.g., PyBullet, Gazebo's Python API).  Consider using a pre-trained object detection model like YOLOv5 or SSD MobileNet.
- **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm),  a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect pre-defined objects (e.g., boxes, balls, cylinders) within the simulated environment using a chosen object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:**  Track the detected objects over time, even if they are partially occluded or move out of the camera's view for short periods. Use a tracking algorithm like Kalman filter or DeepSORT.
- **Robot Control (Basic):**  The robot should have basic movement capabilities (e.g., move forward, turn).  The object tracking data can inform simple robot actions (optional).
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the simulated environment, detected objects, and their tracked trajectories.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the positions of the detected objects over time for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries, create a virtual environment, and choose a robotics simulator.
2. **Integrate object detection:** Load a pre-trained object detection model and integrate it with the simulator's camera feed.
3. **Implement object tracking:** Choose a tracking algorithm and integrate it with the object detection output.
4. **Add basic robot control (optional):**  Implement basic robot movement commands and link them to the tracked object positions (e.g., follow the object).
5. **Develop visualization:** Create a visualization interface showing the simulation, detected objects, and their trajectories.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Performance:** Real-time processing of the camera feed and object tracking can be computationally demanding.  Consider using efficient algorithms and optimizing the code.
- **Simulator Integration:** Seamlessly integrating the object detection and tracking algorithms with the chosen robotics simulator's API might require some debugging and adaptation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of real-time computer vision:**  This project provides hands-on experience with object detection, tracking, and their integration within a robotics context.
- **Develop proficiency in integrating different software components:** The project necessitates coordinating multiple libraries and APIs, enhancing the ability to build complex systems.
