# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a gesture-based smart home control system using a low-power microcontroller and a TinyML model.  The system will recognize a small set of predefined hand gestures captured by a low-resolution camera or sensor, triggering specific smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume). This explores the potential of edge computing for resource-constrained devices, reducing reliance on cloud processing.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with MicroPython for the microcontroller if using one)
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro (for on-device inference)
* **Microcontroller (Optional):** ESP32-CAM or similar (with built-in camera)
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), potentially a gesture recognition library like MediaPipe (depending on complexity)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:** Capture a small set of predefined gestures (e.g., wave, thumbs up, fist) using a camera or sensor.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from the captured data (e.g., using simple image processing techniques or sensor data analysis).
- **Model Inference:** Perform on-device inference using a pre-trained or quickly trained TinyML model to classify gestures.
- **Action Triggering:** Execute pre-defined actions based on the classified gesture (e.g., sending commands to a smart home hub via MQTT).
- **Real-time Feedback (Optional):** Provide visual or auditory feedback on successful gesture recognition.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Model Training:** Train a custom TensorFlow Lite Micro model for higher accuracy.
- **Multiple User Support:**  Allow for recognition of gestures from different users.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect a dataset of images or sensor data representing the chosen gestures.  This could be a simple set of images or pre-recorded sensor data for quicker prototyping.
2. **Model Selection/Training:**  Choose a pre-trained model (if feasible) or train a simple model using TensorFlow Lite Micro. Keep the model size extremely small for resource constraints.
3. **Feature Extraction & Preprocessing:** Implement image processing (if using a camera) or data cleaning for sensor input to prepare data for the model.
4. **Inference & Action Triggering:** Integrate the model into the system, ensuring smooth execution of inference and triggering of smart home actions (simulation is acceptable).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various inputs and refine the model or parameters for better accuracy and robustness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Limited Computational Resources:**  Working with a microcontroller requires careful consideration of memory and processing power.  Simplicity in model architecture and feature extraction is key.
- **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Obtaining high-quality data for training a robust model, especially for a small dataset, is crucial for success.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML implementation:** Gain hands-on experience with building and deploying TinyML models on resource-constrained devices.
- **Edge computing principles:** Understand the advantages and challenges of performing inference on edge devices rather than relying on cloud services.
