# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project focuses on building a rudimentary self-balancing robotic arm using a minimal set of components. The goal is to implement a PID controller to maintain the arm's balance despite external disturbances. This project showcases fundamental control systems concepts within a tangible robotic application, ideal for a short development cycle.  The focus is on functional stability rather than sophisticated movement.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries listed below)
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano (or similar)
- **Sensors:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU)
- **Actuators:** Servo motor (for arm rotation)
- **Libraries:**  `PySerial` (for Arduino communication), `mpu6050` (for IMU data acquisition)
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, Thonny)

## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain an upright position despite minor disturbances (e.g., a gentle push).
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to regulate the servo motor's angle based on IMU feedback.
- **Data Visualization:**  Real-time visualization of IMU data (angles, gyroscope readings) and control signals (PID output).
- **Calibration Routine:** Simple calibration process to account for sensor offsets.
- **Stability Test:**  A method for introducing controlled disturbances and assessing the arm's response.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the Arduino.  Ensure power is correctly supplied to all components.
2. **Sensor Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Write Arduino code to read IMU data and send it serially to the computer. Implement a basic calibration routine in the Arduino code.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Write Python code to receive IMU data, implement the PID algorithm, and send control signals (servo angles) back to the Arduino via serial communication.
4. **Data Visualization (Optional):** Integrate a plotting library (e.g., `matplotlib`) in the Python code to display real-time IMU data and PID output.
5. **Stability Testing:** Manually introduce small disturbances and observe the system's response.  Adjust PID gains (K_p, K_i, K_d) to optimize stability.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains requires iterative adjustments.  Start with low gains and gradually increase them while observing the system's response to avoid oscillations or instability.
- **Sensor Noise:** The MPU6050 might produce noisy data. Implement filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) to improve accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control Implementation:** Practical experience in implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems.
- **Embedded Systems Integration:**  Hands-on experience in integrating microcontroller (Arduino) with a sensor (IMU) and actuator (servo motor) through serial communication.
