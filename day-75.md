# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a system that allows a robotic arm (simulated or physical) to detect and track a specific object in real-time using a webcam feed. This combines computer vision with robotic control, providing a practical example of AI-driven automation.  The goal is to create a functional prototype capable of picking up and placing the target object within a limited workspace.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for object detection model), Robotic Operating System (ROS) or a robotic arm's specific SDK (if using a physical robot)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  Webcam, Robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR), a suitable computer

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should accurately detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) from a webcam feed using a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:**  Once detected, the system should continuously track the object's position as it moves within the camera's field of view.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** The system should send commands to the robotic arm (simulated or physical) to move its end-effector to the object's detected location.
- **Grasping/Picking:** The robotic arm should attempt to grasp and lift the object (simulation or physical).
- **Placement:** The robotic arm should then place the object in a pre-defined location.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Object Handling:** Extend the system to detect and track multiple objects simultaneously.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Integrate a basic obstacle detection and avoidance mechanism.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Object Detection:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet). Test object detection on a webcam feed.
2. **Object Tracking:** Implement an object tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.Tracker` functions) to maintain tracking of the detected object across frames.
3. **Robotic Arm Integration:**  Connect to the robotic arm (simulated or physical) using its SDK or ROS.  Map the camera coordinates to the robot's coordinate system.
4. **Control & Movement:** Develop the logic to send commands to the robotic arm based on the tracked object's position, commanding the arm to reach, grasp and place the object.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the entire system, adjusting parameters and refining the control logic as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Coordinate Transformations:** Accurately mapping the camera coordinates to the robot's coordinate system can be challenging and requires careful calibration.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing real-time performance with accuracy in object detection and tracking can be demanding, requiring efficient algorithms and potentially model optimization.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of real-time computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience in object detection, tracking, and image processing.
- **Gain practical experience in robotic control:**  This project provides practical knowledge in interfacing with robotic systems and coordinating actions based on sensory input.
