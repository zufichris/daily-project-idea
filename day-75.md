# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified traffic light simulation that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize traffic flow.  The simulation will focus on a single intersection with multiple lanes, allowing for exploration of RL techniques within a constrained, yet realistically challenging, environment.  This is significant because it demonstrates a practical application of RL in a domain relevant to urban planning and transportation management.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), TensorFlow/Keras (for RL model), possibly Stable Baselines3 (for simplified RL implementation).


## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Generation:**  Realistic generation of vehicles with varying speeds and arrival times.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implementation of a traffic light system with adjustable timing.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Training an RL agent (e.g., using Q-learning or Deep Q-Network) to optimize traffic light timing based on simulated traffic conditions.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Tracking metrics such as average waiting time, throughput, and total stopped time.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the simulation using Pygame.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Incorporating different vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses) with varying priorities.
- **Advanced Feature:** Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Create the basic simulation environment using Pygame, including road representation, vehicle generation logic, and traffic light visualization.
2. **Implement a simple traffic light controller:**  Start with a fixed-time traffic light controller as a baseline.
3. **Implement the RL agent:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and integrate it to control the traffic light timing based on observed traffic conditions.  Focus on a small state and action space to manage complexity.
4. **Train the agent:** Train the RL agent using the simulation environment, aiming for improved performance metrics (e.g., minimizing average waiting time).
5. **Visualize and analyze results:** Plot the performance metrics over training iterations and observe the agent's learned behavior.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **State space explosion:**  The state space can grow quickly with more lanes and vehicle types.  Careful state representation design is crucial for tractability within a limited timeframe.
- **Reward function design:** Crafting an effective reward function that accurately reflects desired traffic flow optimization is critical for successful training.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:**  Hands-on experience with implementing and training an RL agent in a practical context.
- **Simulation and Modeling:**  Developing and working with a simplified simulation of a real-world system.
