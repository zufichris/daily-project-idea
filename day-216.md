# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with Raspberry Pi & OpenCV

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and OpenCV.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within its camera view, providing its coordinates and potentially its trajectory. This is a valuable skill for robotics, security systems, and various automation tasks.  The daily challenge focuses on implementing a robust and efficient tracking algorithm within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Raspberry Pi:**  (Model 3B+ or newer recommended)
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module:**  For image capture.
- **Python:** Programming language.
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision library for object detection and tracking.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computation.
- **Optional:**  A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNetSSD)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Identify a predefined object (e.g., a colored ball) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames, providing continuous coordinate updates.
- **Coordinate Output:** Display the object's (x, y) coordinates on the screen or output them to a console.
- **Frame Rate Monitoring:**  Display or log the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.
- **Basic UI (Optional):** A simple graphical user interface to display the video feed and tracking information.

- **Advanced Features:**  Prediction of future object positions based on tracked trajectory.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a robotic arm for object manipulation based on detected location.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) on the Raspberry Pi. Configure the camera module.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement object detection using a color thresholding technique (for simplicity) or load and utilize a pre-trained object detection model if time permits.
3. **Object Tracking:**  Use a simple tracking algorithm like centroid tracking or Kalman filtering to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Coordinate Output & Display:** Display the tracked object's coordinates on the video feed or output them to the console.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Monitor and log the FPS to assess the system's real-time capabilities.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational limitations:**  The Raspberry Pi might struggle with complex object detection models or high-resolution video. Consider optimizing the code and using simpler algorithms for real-time performance.
- **Lighting conditions:** Varying lighting can affect object detection accuracy. Explore techniques for robust color thresholding or investigate the use of more advanced object detection models less sensitive to lighting changes.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of real-time image processing:** This project provides hands-on experience with acquiring, processing, and analyzing video streams in real-time.
- **Practical experience with object detection and tracking algorithms:**  Implementing and comparing different tracking methods will enhance the understanding of their strengths and limitations.
