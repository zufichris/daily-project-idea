#  Miniature Robot Arm Calibration with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified calibration routine for a miniature robotic arm using a machine learning model.  The goal is to create a self-calibrating system that can quickly adjust for minor positional inaccuracies in the arm's movements, making it more precise and robust without requiring extensive manual adjustments.  This is a valuable skill in robotics, particularly for applications requiring high repeatability but using inexpensive, less precise actuators.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Scikit-learn (for regression), OpenCV (for image processing â€“ optional, for advanced feature)
* **Hardware:**  A small, 3-DOF robotic arm (e.g., a commercially available kit) with position sensors (encoders or potentiometers), and a small, fixed camera (optional, for advanced feature).

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Calibration:** The system should automatically calibrate the arm's zero position using a simple algorithm based on sensor readings.
- **Linear Regression Model:**  A linear regression model should be trained to correct for minor positional errors based on sensor data and target positions.
- **Command Execution:**  The system should accurately execute commands (e.g., move to (x, y, z) coordinates) after calibration.
- **Performance Measurement:**  A simple metric (e.g., average error) should evaluate the calibration accuracy.
- **Data Logging:**  Sensor data and model predictions should be logged for analysis.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Image-based calibration using OpenCV to improve accuracy by referencing visual markers.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implementing a more sophisticated model (e.g., neural network) for non-linear error correction.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect a dataset of arm commands and corresponding sensor readings by manually moving the arm to various positions and recording the data.
2. **Model Training:** Use Scikit-learn to train a linear regression model on the collected data, predicting the actual position from the commanded position and sensor readings.
3. **Calibration Routine:** Develop a function that uses the trained model to correct commanded positions before sending them to the arm's control system.
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the calibration routine, measuring the accuracy and making adjustments to the model or data collection process as needed.
5. **Implementation:** Integrate the calibration routine into the arm's control software.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:**  Dealing with noise in the sensor readings will be crucial for accurate calibration. Implementing data smoothing techniques might be necessary.
- **Model Complexity:** Balancing model complexity and performance will require experimentation. A simple linear model might suffice, or a more complex model may be needed depending on the arm's characteristics.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of machine learning algorithms for robotics calibration.**
- **Gain experience in data acquisition, model training, and evaluation within a robotic system.**
