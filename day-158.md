# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a self-balancing robot arm using a microcontroller and PID control.  The goal is to create a small-scale robotic arm that maintains its balance even when subjected to external disturbances, showcasing a fundamental control system algorithm.  This provides a tangible example of real-world robotics challenges and solutions.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (or similar with sufficient processing power and I/O)
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)
* **Sensors:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU for acceleration and gyroscope data)
* **Actuators:** Two micro servo motors (for base and arm rotation)
* **Libraries:**  Wire.h (for I2C communication with IMU), Servo.h (for servo motor control)
* **Tools:** Breadboard, Jumper wires, Soldering iron (potentially), 3D printed or constructed arm structure


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position even when slightly pushed or tilted.
- **PID Control Implementation:** The core control logic uses a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to regulate the arm's balance.
- **Sensor Data Acquisition:**  The MPU6050 IMU accurately measures angular velocity and acceleration to provide feedback to the PID controller.
- **Servo Motor Control:** Precise control of the servo motors based on the PID controller's output to adjust the arm's position.
- **Basic User Interface (Optional):** A simple serial monitor output to display sensor readings and controller values.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple "setpoint" functionality allowing the user to manually adjust the desired arm angle.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Incorporate a Kalman filter for sensor fusion to improve accuracy and noise reduction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motors to the Arduino.  Build or assemble the physical arm structure.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the MPU6050 to obtain accurate baseline readings.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Write the C++ code for the PID controller, incorporating sensor readings and servo motor control.  Tune the PID gains (K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>i</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>) experimentally for optimal performance.
4. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the system's stability and responsiveness.  Fine-tune the PID gains to minimize oscillations and ensure a stable upright position.
5. **(Optional) User Interface Implementation:**  Add a simple serial monitor display to show sensor data and control parameters.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and require iterative adjustments. Start with conservative values and gradually increase them while observing the system's behavior.
- **Sensor Noise:** The IMU data might be noisy; consider using a filtering technique (e.g., moving average filter) or Kalman filter to improve accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID Control:**  Practical implementation and understanding of the PID algorithm, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Embedded Systems Development:**  Hands-on experience with microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and actuator control.
