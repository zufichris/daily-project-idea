# Automated Bug Report Triaging System (Prototype)

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype of an automated system for triaging bug reports.  The system will analyze incoming bug reports (e.g., from a GitHub issue tracker) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to categorize and prioritize them, assisting developers in efficiently managing their workload.  This is significant because it can drastically reduce the time spent on manual bug report sorting and prioritization, leading to faster resolution times.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **NLP Library:** spaCy or NLTK
* **Machine Learning Library (Optional):** scikit-learn (for advanced prioritization)
* **Data Source:**  A sample dataset of bug reports (can be simulated or obtained from a public repository).
* **Framework (Optional):** Flask or FastAPI for creating a simple web interface.


## Features & Requirements

- **Bug Report Categorization:** Automatically categorize incoming bug reports based on keywords and NLP analysis (e.g., UI bug, API bug, performance issue).
- **Severity Assessment:**  Assign a preliminary severity level (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) based on report description.
- **Duplicate Detection:** Identify and flag duplicate bug reports.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Extract key technical terms and error messages from the report for easier searching and filtering.
- **Basic Reporting:** Generate a simple summary of categorized and prioritized bug reports.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a machine learning model to refine severity assessment based on historical data.
- **Optional: Integration with existing bug tracker API:**  For more realistic testing.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Gather a sample dataset of bug reports. Clean and preprocess the text data (remove irrelevant characters, handle casing, etc.).
2. **NLP Model Development:** Build a simple NLP pipeline using spaCy or NLTK. This involves defining keywords for categorization and potentially training a named entity recognition (NER) model for extracting relevant information.
3. **Categorization & Severity Logic:** Implement logic to categorize reports based on keyword matching and NLP analysis.  Develop a heuristic rule-based system for assigning initial severity levels.
4. **Duplicate Detection:** Implement a simple string similarity algorithm (e.g., Jaccard similarity) to detect duplicate reports.
5. **Prototype Development & Testing:** Create a simple script or a basic web interface (using Flask or FastAPI) to test the system's functionality with the sample dataset.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Bias:**  The accuracy of the system heavily depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. A biased dataset will lead to biased results.  Addressing this requires careful data selection and preprocessing.
- **Ambiguity in Natural Language:**  Natural language can be ambiguous, making accurate categorization and severity assessment challenging.  Robust NLP techniques and error handling are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of NLP techniques** in a real-world problem.
- **Develop skills in building data-driven automation systems** that improve workflow efficiency.
