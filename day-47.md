# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to create a functional AI opponent within a short timeframe, showcasing the core principles of reinforcement learning in a practical application.  This is significant because it demonstrates a fundamental AI concept quickly and tangibly.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  NumPy, OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional and playable Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four game environment.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An AI agent that learns to play the game through reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler algorithm).
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the AI agent against itself or a random opponent.
- **Evaluation Metric:** A way to measure the AI's performance (e.g., win rate against a random player).
- **Basic Visualization:** Displaying the game board and the agent's actions.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Hyperparameter tuning for the RL algorithm; implementing a more sophisticated exploration-exploitation strategy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment (using a library or manually coding it). Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point). Implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on its learned policy.
3. **Training Loop Design:**  Create a loop that trains the agent by repeatedly playing games, updating its Q-values based on the received rewards.
4. **Evaluation:**  Test the trained agent against a random player or a simple rule-based opponent to assess its performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  Add basic visualization to show the game board and the AI's moves during training and evaluation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining a suitable reward function that encourages optimal play is crucial. A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior.
- **Computational Cost:**  Training an RL agent can be computationally intensive; managing the training time within the daily challenge timeframe requires careful consideration of algorithm choice and training parameters.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:**  This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like states, actions, rewards, policies, and value functions.
- **Practical Application of AI:** The project provides hands-on experience in building and evaluating a simple AI agent, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
