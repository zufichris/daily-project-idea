# AI-Powered Smart Home Device Control via Voice

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype for a smart home device control system using voice commands and a simple AI model.  The system will allow users to control basic smart home functionalities (e.g., lighting, temperature) through natural language processing, focusing on rapid prototyping and core functionality.  This is significant as it demonstrates a simplified approach to building a more complex AI-powered system within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework/Library:**  `SpeechRecognition` (for speech-to-text), `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech), a lightweight machine learning library like `scikit-learn` (for simple intent classification), potentially a cloud-based speech-to-text API like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for higher accuracy.
* **Tools:**  A simple text editor (VS Code recommended), Python interpreter.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Command Recognition:**  The system should accurately recognize basic voice commands like "Turn on the lights," "Set the temperature to 22 degrees," and "Turn off the fan."
- **Action Execution:**  The system should execute the corresponding actions based on the recognized commands.  This could involve simulated control (printing to the console) or integration with a mock smart home API.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle unrecognized commands or errors during execution.
- **Simple Intent Classification:** The system should be able to differentiate between similar commands (e.g., "Turn on the living room lights" vs "Turn on the bedroom lights").
- **Basic Feedback:**  The system provides audio or text feedback confirming the executed command.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Contextual awareness (understanding previous commands), multiple user profiles.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a real smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Collection:** Set up the development environment, install necessary libraries, and collect a small dataset of voice commands and corresponding actions (this can be a simple text file).
2. **Speech-to-Text Implementation:** Implement speech-to-text functionality using `SpeechRecognition` or a cloud API.  Test the accuracy and handle potential errors.
3. **Intent Classification (Simple):** Implement a basic intent classification model using `scikit-learn`.  This could be a simple keyword-based approach or a very basic machine learning model.
4. **Action Execution:**  Implement functions to execute the actions based on the classified intent.  Initially, focus on simulated control (printing to console) for simplicity.
5. **Text-to-Speech Feedback:**  Implement text-to-speech using `pyttsx3` to provide confirmation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with free, open-source libraries can be challenging. Consider using a cloud-based API for better results if time permits.
- **Robustness of Intent Classification:**  A very simple model might not be highly accurate or robust.  Focusing on a small, well-defined set of commands helps mitigate this.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies:** This project reinforces the understanding of how to integrate these technologies into a larger system.
- **Introduction to basic AI concepts (Intent Classification):** This provides hands-on experience with building a simple AI model for natural language understanding.
