# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV and a pre-trained model.  The goal is to demonstrate the integration of computer vision techniques for identifying and following a specific object within a video stream. This is significant as it forms a fundamental component in various applications like robotics, autonomous driving, and surveillance systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for pre-trained model), NumPy
* **Tools:**  A webcam or video file


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Processing:**  Process video frames from a webcam or video file at a reasonable frame rate (e.g., 15-20 FPS).
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-selected object (e.g., a red ball, a person) within each frame using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object across multiple frames using a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, CSRT).
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object in each frame, displaying it on the video output.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) achieved during processing.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a mechanism to switch between different pre-trained models for object detection.
- **Advanced Feature:** Add a simple user interface (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt) for model selection and parameter adjustment.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy). Download a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Video Input & Preprocessing:** Load video from a webcam or file.  Optionally resize frames for faster processing.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Use the pre-trained model to detect the object in each frame. Implement the chosen tracking algorithm to maintain object location across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Draw bounding boxes and FPS on each frame. Display the processed video using OpenCV's `imshow` function.
5. **Optimization (Optional):** Profile the code to identify bottlenecks. Consider using multithreading or GPU acceleration to improve FPS.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially with high-resolution video or complex models.  Consider optimizing the code and potentially using a less computationally expensive model.
- **Object Occlusion:** The tracking algorithm might struggle if the object is temporarily occluded. Implementing robust occlusion handling techniques may require more time than the one-day timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical understanding of OpenCV:** Gain experience in video processing, object detection, and visualization using OpenCV.
- **Experience with pre-trained models:** Learn how to integrate and utilize pre-trained deep learning models for computer vision tasks.
