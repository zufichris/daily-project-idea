# Self-Balancing Robot Simulation

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a 2D simulation of a self-balancing robot using a physics engine.  The goal is to implement a PID controller to stabilize the robot's upright position, showcasing a fundamental control system concept in a visually engaging way.  This simulation provides a simplified yet effective way to experiment with control algorithms without the complexities of building physical hardware.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Physics Engine:** Pygame (for simpler visualization) or Pymunk (for more advanced physics)
* **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm

## Features & Requirements

- **Robot Model:**  A simple 2D representation of a robot with a base and a pole (inverted pendulum).
- **Physics Simulation:**  Accurate simulation of gravity and robot movement based on applied forces.
- **PID Controller Implementation:**  A functional PID controller to maintain the robot's balance.
- **Sensor Simulation:**  Simulated accelerometer and gyroscope readings to feed the PID controller.
- **Visualization:**  Real-time graphical representation of the robot's position and angle.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementation of different control algorithms (e.g., LQR) for comparison.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Adding external disturbances (e.g., simulated wind gusts) to test controller robustness.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pygame/Pymunk) and create a project structure.
2. **Create the robot model:** Design the robot's visual representation and define its physical properties (mass, inertia).
3. **Implement the physics simulation:** Use the chosen physics engine to simulate gravity, forces, and collisions.
4. **Implement the PID controller:**  Design and implement the PID controller logic based on sensor data (angle and angular velocity).
5. **Integrate and visualize:** Combine all components to create a running simulation that displays the robot's behavior.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:**  Finding optimal PID gains for stable balancing can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with conservative values and gradually tune.
- **Simulation Accuracy:**  Balancing the accuracy of the simulation with computational efficiency is key, especially when aiming for real-time visualization.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control concepts:**  Understanding and implementing a PID controller is a crucial skill in robotics and control systems.
- **Practical experience with physics engines:** This project allows for hands-on experience with a physics engine, which is valuable for various simulation tasks.
