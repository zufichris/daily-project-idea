# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified self-balancing robot arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller. The goal is to implement a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain the arm's balance despite external disturbances, demonstrating real-time control system principles in a compact and manageable form.  This project focuses on a single degree of freedom, making it achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 can be used for more advanced features).
* **Servo Motor:**  A standard hobby servo with sufficient torque.
* **Sensor:**  MPU6050 (6-axis IMU) for measuring angular velocity and acceleration.
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Libraries:**  Wire.h (for I2C communication with MPU6050), Servo.h (for controlling the servo).
* **Tools:** Breadboard, jumper wires, soldering iron (if necessary for permanent connections).


## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain a stable upright position using PID control.
- **Sensor Integration:** Accurate reading of angular data from the MPU6050.
- **Servo Control:** Precise control of the servo motor based on sensor feedback.
- **Real-time Response:**  The system should react quickly to disturbances, correcting the arm's position effectively.
- **Calibration Routine:** A simple calibration process to adjust the neutral position of the servo.

**Advanced Features:**
- **External Disturbance Handling:**  Testing the robustness of the system by applying small external forces to the arm.
- **Visual Feedback:**  (Optional) Displaying sensor data or control signals on an LCD screen.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the microcontroller.  Power all components appropriately.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Implement a calibration routine to account for sensor biases and offsets.
3. **PID Implementation:**  Write the core PID control algorithm, tuning the proportional (Kp), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains experimentally to achieve optimal stability.
4. **Control Loop:** Create the main control loop that continuously reads sensor data, applies the PID algorithm, and sends control signals to the servo.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the system's response to disturbances and fine-tune the PID gains to achieve stable and responsive balancing.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:**  Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments. Experiment with different gain values to find a stable and responsive balance.
- **Sensor Noise:**  Filtering sensor data to minimize the effect of noise is important for accurate control.  A simple moving average filter could be implemented.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** This project provides hands-on experience with designing and implementing a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Real-time Embedded Systems:** It reinforces skills in working with microcontrollers, sensors, and real-time control loops in an embedded system context.
