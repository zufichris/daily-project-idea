# TinyML-Powered Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a low-power microcontroller and machine learning to recognize simple hand gestures.  The goal is to create a functional, albeit limited, system capable of triggering pre-defined actions based on recognized gestures within a short timeframe.  This demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of TinyML for resource-constrained applications.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:**  MicroPython (for ease of rapid prototyping on microcontroller)
* **Microcontroller:** ESP32-CAM (integrated camera and processing power)
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
* **Development Environment:** PlatformIO or Arduino IDE
* **Tools:**  A suitable image dataset for training (can be easily created), a computer for training the model.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., wave, thumbs up, fist).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process camera input and classify gestures in near real-time.
- **Action Triggering:**  Map recognized gestures to specific smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).
- **Model Deployment:** Successfully deploy the trained TensorFlow Lite Micro model to the ESP32-CAM.
- **Basic User Interface:**  A simple LED indicator to show gesture recognition status.

- **Advanced Features:**  Gesture sequence recognition (e.g., two waves to turn off lights).
- **Optional Feature:**  Integration with a smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant) for broader control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Dataset Creation:** Capture images of the chosen gestures and organize them into labeled datasets.  Use a simple background.
2. **Model Training:** Train a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow Lite Micro's tools and the prepared dataset. Export the quantized model for deployment on the ESP32-CAM.
3. **ESP32-CAM Setup:** Set up the ESP32-CAM's camera and integrate the TensorFlow Lite Micro inference code.
4. **Gesture Processing and Action Triggering:**  Implement the logic to capture frames, perform inference, and trigger the corresponding actions (e.g., controlling GPIO pins connected to lights or relays).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly with various lighting conditions and gesture variations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Dataset Quality:**  Creating a sufficiently diverse and representative dataset in a short timeframe requires careful planning and execution. Using augmentation techniques can mitigate limitations.
- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing accuracy and speed on a low-power microcontroller may require careful model optimization and code tuning.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Implementation:**  Gain practical experience in deploying and using TensorFlow Lite Micro for real-time inference on a resource-constrained device.
- **Embedded System Programming:**  Improve skills in embedded system development, specifically interfacing hardware components and managing low-level resources.
