# Mini-Game AI for Existing Game Engine

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet effective AI opponent for an existing, readily available game engine like Pygame or Unity's built-in 2D capabilities.  The AI will be designed for a classic game like Pong or a simplified version of Breakout, focusing on demonstrating a viable AI approach within a constrained timeframe. The significance lies in exploring practical AI implementation and integrating it into a visual environment for immediate feedback.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with Pygame) or C# (with Unity)
- **Game Engine:** Pygame (preferred for faster prototyping) or Unity (for more advanced graphics)
- **AI Algorithm:**  Minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning for optimization, if time permits).
- **IDE:** Any suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, Visual Studio).

## Features & Requirements
- **Basic AI Opponent:**  The AI should be able to effectively play against a human player in a chosen game (Pong or simplified Breakout).
- **Difficulty Levels:** The AI should offer at least two difficulty levels (easy, medium) adjusted via a simple parameter.
- **Score Tracking:**  The game should display the score for both the player and the AI.
- **Game Over Condition:** Implement a clear game over condition (e.g., reaching a certain score or losing all lives).
- **Basic Visuals:**  The game should have minimal but functional visuals representing the game elements.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement learning capabilities (e.g., a very simple reinforcement learning approach) for improved AI performance over multiple games.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Add a user interface (UI) for selecting difficulty and viewing game statistics.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Set up the chosen game engine and create the basic game environment (paddle, ball, walls).  Focus on a simple, functional game structure.
2. **AI Implementation:** Implement the Minimax algorithm (or a simpler AI strategy if time is extremely limited) to control the AI opponent's actions.  Prioritize a functioning AI over sophisticated strategies.
3. **Difficulty Levels:** Implement different difficulty levels by modifying parameters within the AI (e.g., lookahead depth in Minimax).
4. **Score and Game Over:**  Integrate score tracking and a game over condition into the game loop.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the AI against human players and refine its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm Complexity:** The Minimax algorithm can be computationally expensive, especially with a larger lookahead depth.  Consider simplifying the game or limiting the search depth for faster performance.
- **Game Engine Familiarity:**  Unfamiliarity with the chosen game engine might lead to delays. Prior experience with Pygame or Unity is strongly recommended.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Game AI Development:**  Reinforces practical skills in developing AI for game environments.
- **Algorithm Implementation:**  Provides hands-on experience with implementing and optimizing game AI algorithms like Minimax.
