# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.  The goal is to demonstrate a functional AI agent capable of learning optimal strategies within a short timeframe. This project showcases fundamental RL concepts in a practical and easily demonstrable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Game Library:** Pygame (for simplicity and rapid prototyping)
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (provides pre-built algorithms)
- **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm (personal preference)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Mechanics:** A simple game like Pong or a simplified version of Snake.
- **AI Opponent:** An AI player using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
- **Training Loop:** A training loop to allow the AI to learn through interactions with a random or fixed player.
- **Visualization:** Real-time display of the game and the AI's performance metrics (e.g., reward).
- **Basic scoring system:** Track the AI's wins and losses.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement a simple reward shaping mechanism to guide the AI's learning process.
- **Optional Feature:**  Use a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN) for comparison.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Create the basic game framework using Pygame.  Implement the core game logic and rendering.
2. **Environment Wrapper:**  Create a Gym environment wrapper around the game to interface with the RL library.
3. **AI Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (PPO recommended for ease of use) from Stable Baselines3 and integrate it with the game environment.
4. **Training & Evaluation:** Run the training loop for a set number of steps or episodes.  Evaluate the AI's performance against a random or fixed-strategy opponent.
5. **Visualization & Refinement:**  Display game progress and key metrics.  Fine-tune hyperparameters (learning rate, etc.) based on the performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Creating a reward function that effectively guides the AI towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Careful consideration is needed to balance rewards and prevent unintended behaviors.
- **Computational Resources:** Training a reinforcement learning agent can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the game or adjusting training parameters might be necessary to keep the project within a reasonable timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain hands-on experience with RL concepts such as policy gradients, reward functions, and training loops.
- **Gym Environment Interaction:** Learn how to create and utilize Gym environments for RL agent development, fostering reusability and modularity.
