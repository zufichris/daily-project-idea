# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with Webcam Feed

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The system will identify and track a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view, displaying bounding boxes and potentially object coordinates. This serves as a foundational project for more complex computer vision applications and reinforces key concepts in image processing and machine learning.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (or a similar lightweight ML framework like PyTorch Mobile), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a suitable Python IDE (PyCharm, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time video capture:**  Capture and display the webcam feed.
- **Object detection:**  Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the video stream using color filtering or a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames using techniques like centroid tracking or optical flow.
- **Bounding box display:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object on the video feed.
- **Coordinate display (optional):** Display the (x,y) coordinates of the object's center.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple object classification system alongside tracking (e.g., distinguishing between a red ball and a blue cube).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Use a more robust object tracking algorithm like DeepSORT for improved accuracy.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy).  Test webcam connectivity using OpenCV.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement basic color filtering (if using a simple object like a red ball) or load and run a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a MobileNet SSD) for more general object detection.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple centroid tracking algorithm to follow the detected object across frames.  This involves calculating the centroid of the bounding box in each frame and tracking its movement.
4. **Visualization:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes and optionally, object coordinates overlaid on the stream.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time permits, incorporate the advanced features (object classification, improved tracking algorithms).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially with complex object detection models.  Consider optimizing the code for speed or using a less computationally demanding model.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracking algorithm might lose the object if it becomes temporarily occluded.  Explore more robust tracking methods to mitigate this issue.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce practical skills in image processing and computer vision:** This project provides hands-on experience with image manipulation, object detection, and tracking.
- **Gain experience with real-time video processing:**  Understanding the challenges and techniques involved in processing video data in real-time.
