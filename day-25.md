# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home appliance control system using a combination of voice recognition and hand gesture detection.  The system will allow users to control a simulated appliance (e.g., a lamp, fan) through voice commands and simple hand gestures, demonstrating a multimodal human-computer interaction approach.  This is significant because it explores the fusion of different input modalities for improved user experience and accessibility.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `SpeechRecognition` (for voice recognition)
    * `MediaPipe` (for hand gesture recognition - specifically, the Hands solution)
    * `Pygame` (for basic GUI and visual feedback)
    * `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech output â€“ optional)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A webcam for gesture recognition. If not available, simulated hand data can be used.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Increase brightness," etc.
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should interpret simple gestures, such as a hand raising (to increase brightness/speed) or lowering (to decrease brightness/speed) to control appliance states.
- **Appliance Simulation:**  A simple visual representation of the appliance (e.g., a rectangle changing color or size) should update based on commands.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle invalid commands or gestures with feedback messages.
- **Basic GUI:** A minimal graphical user interface showing the current appliance state.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a real-world appliance via a suitable API (e.g., controlling a smart plug).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporating a more robust gesture recognition library that can handle more complex gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install SpeechRecognition mediapipe pygame pyttsx3`).
2. **Voice Recognition Module:** Implement voice command recognition and processing, mapping commands to appliance actions.
3. **Gesture Recognition Module:** Implement hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe, extracting relevant landmarks for gesture classification (raise/lower).
4. **Appliance Simulation:** Create a simple graphical representation of the appliance and update its state based on voice and gesture inputs.
5. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate voice and gesture modules, test thoroughly, and handle error cases.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Recognition:**  Both speech and gesture recognition can be susceptible to noise and variations in input.  Consider adding error handling and robustness techniques (e.g., confidence thresholds).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing responsiveness with accuracy in real-time processing is crucial.  Optimization techniques may be needed to prevent lags.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of multimodal human-computer interaction design.
- Practical experience with implementing and integrating different computer vision and speech recognition libraries within a single application.
