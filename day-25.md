# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gesture recognition via a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures performed in front of the camera, triggering pre-defined smart home actions. This offers a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional voice or app-based control, providing a more natural and potentially faster interaction method. The focus will be on a small set of gestures for proof-of-concept.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation), a suitable smart home API library (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Tools:**  A webcam, Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for volume up, thumbs down for volume down).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Trigger pre-defined actions in a smart home system (e.g., changing light brightness, adjusting thermostat).
- **User Calibration:** Allow for user-specific calibration to improve accuracy.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle situations where gestures are not recognized or are ambiguous.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple User Support:** Extend the system to recognize gestures from multiple users.
- **Customizable Gestures:** Allow users to define their own gestures and associated actions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, connect the webcam, and collect a small dataset of images/videos for each target gesture using OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement a model using MediaPipe's pose estimation to extract relevant hand features.  Develop a simple classifier (e.g., using k-Nearest Neighbors or a small neural network) to distinguish between gestures based on these features.
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Integrate with a chosen smart home API.  Map detected gestures to specific API commands to control smart home devices.
4. **Real-time Implementation:**  Combine steps 2 and 3 into a real-time application that processes webcam feed continuously and triggers actions based on gesture recognition.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly, adjusting parameters and potentially retraining the classifier to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of gesture detection. Solutions include image preprocessing techniques (e.g., histogram equalization) or more robust feature extraction methods.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Similar gestures might be difficult to distinguish.  Carefully selecting distinct gestures and employing more sophisticated classification techniques can help address this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision techniques:** This project enhances understanding of real-time image processing, feature extraction, and classification using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Develop experience with smart home APIs:**  This project offers hands-on experience integrating software with a smart home ecosystem, expanding knowledge in IoT and API interaction.
