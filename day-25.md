#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet effective obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on training a lightweight agent capable of navigating a small, controlled environment. This project emphasizes practical application of RL concepts within a constrained timeframe.  The significance lies in exploring the feasibility of deploying RL for real-time control in resource-limited robotic systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3
* **Drone Simulation Environment:** AirSim (or a simpler custom environment)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib (for plotting reward curves)

## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Detection:**  The drone should detect obstacles (e.g., simulated cubes or walls) within its sensor range (using simulated lidar or depth camera data).
- **Navigation:** The drone should navigate through the environment avoiding collisions.
- **Reward Function:** A reward system should incentivize safe navigation and penalize collisions.
- **Training:** A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) should be trained to maximize the reward.
- **Basic Control:** The drone should have basic control capabilities (forward, backward, left, right, up, down).


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Dynamic obstacle avoidance (moving obstacles).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Goal-oriented navigation (reaching a specific target location).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the chosen drone simulation environment (AirSim or custom) with a simple scene containing obstacles.
2. **Agent Design & Training:** Define a simple reward function and train a PPO agent using Stable Baselines3.  Start with a small, easily navigable environment to speed up training.
3. **Control Implementation:** Integrate the trained agent’s actions with the drone’s control system in the simulation.
4. **Testing and Evaluation:** Test the trained agent in the simulated environment and evaluate its performance (success rate, collision frequency).
5. **Refinement (Time Permitting):** Refine the reward function, hyperparameters, or environment complexity based on the results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Training Time:** Training a reinforcement learning agent can be time-consuming.  Focus on a small, simplified environment to reduce training time and achieve demonstrable results within the timeframe.
- **Simulation Fidelity:** The accuracy of the simulation impacts the transferability of the trained agent to a real-world drone.  Careful consideration of simulation parameters is necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent for a robotics task.
- **Robotics Simulation:** Develop proficiency in using a drone simulation environment for prototyping and testing control algorithms.
