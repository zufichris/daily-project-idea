# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home appliance control system using a combination of voice recognition and hand gesture detection.  The system will allow users to control a single appliance (e.g., a smart lamp) through simple voice commands and gestures, focusing on quick prototyping and demonstrating the integration of different input modalities. This offers a practical application of multi-modal interaction in a smart home context.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
    - `speech_recognition`: For voice command processing.
    - `mediapipe`: For hand gesture recognition (specifically, MediaPipe Hands).
    - `RPi.GPIO` (if using a Raspberry Pi for physical control): For interfacing with the appliance (e.g., controlling a relay).
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi, relay module, smart lamp or other compatible appliance.  Can be simulated initially without physical hardware.

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Turn the appliance ON/OFF using voice commands like "Turn on the lamp" or "Switch off the light".
- **Gesture Control:** Turn the appliance ON/OFF using predefined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for ON, closed fist for OFF).
- **Confirmation Feedback:** Provide visual or auditory feedback upon successful command execution.
- **Error Handling:** Handle invalid voice commands or gesture recognition failures gracefully.
- **Appliance Selection (Optional):** Allow selection of different appliances to control (requires expanding hardware interface).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment and install libraries:** Install Python and the required libraries (`speech_recognition`, `mediapipe`, `RPi.GPIO` if needed).
2. **Implement Voice Recognition:** Integrate `speech_recognition` to process voice input and map commands to actions (ON/OFF).
3. **Implement Gesture Recognition:** Use `mediapipe` to detect hand gestures and map them to actions (ON/OFF).  Focus on a single, easily distinguishable gesture pair.
4. **Control Appliance (Simulation or Physical):** If using a Raspberry Pi and physical appliance, program the GPIO to control the relay.  Otherwise, simulate appliance control using print statements or simple visual feedback.
5. **Combine & Test:** Integrate voice and gesture recognition modules, add feedback mechanisms, and thoroughly test all functionalities.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech/Gesture Recognition:** Real-world conditions (noise, lighting) can affect accuracy.  Implement basic error handling and potentially explore more robust recognition models if time allows.
- **Hardware Integration (if applicable):** Interfacing with physical appliances requires careful consideration of wiring and safety.  Thoroughly test hardware components before integration.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multi-modal interaction design:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing systems that combine different input modalities (voice and gesture).
- **Real-time processing:**  Develop skills in processing real-time input streams (audio and video) for immediate response.
