#  Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a micro-gesture recognition system that can control smart home devices using subtle hand movements captured by a readily available webcam.  This reduces reliance on voice commands or physical interfaces, providing a more intuitive and potentially privacy-enhancing control mechanism.  The focus is on a streamlined, proof-of-concept system achievable within a short timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model optimization and deployment)
* **Hardware:** Webcam (built-in or external), Computer with Python and necessary libraries installed.
* **Optional:**  Raspberry Pi for a more embedded solution (adds complexity and extends beyond a 1-2 day timeframe).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurately track hand position and orientation from webcam feed.
- **Gesture Definition & Mapping:** Define 3-4 distinct micro-gestures (e.g., hand wave for lights on/off, fist for volume up, open palm for volume down).  Map these gestures to specific smart home actions (e.g., controlling Philips Hue lights, adjusting system volume).
- **User Interface (UI):**  A simple visual interface displaying detected gestures and their mapped actions (can be a basic window showing the processed video feed and action labels).
- **Robustness to Noise:** Minimize false positives by incorporating some noise reduction techniques.
- **Action Execution:** Trigger smart home actions (simulated initially; integration with a real smart home system is an advanced feature).

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Integration with a real smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant, IFTTT).
- Model Training: Fine-tune a pre-trained model for improved accuracy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Hand Tracking:** Set up the environment, install libraries, and implement real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe's hand detection model within OpenCV.  Display the video feed with hand landmarks overlaid.
2. **Gesture Definition and Feature Extraction:** Define the 3-4 micro-gestures. Extract relevant features from the hand landmarks (e.g., relative positions of fingers, hand orientation) for each gesture.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Implement a simple classifier (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors or a basic decision tree) to classify the extracted features into the defined gestures.  This will require creating a small dataset of gesture samples.
4. **Action Mapping and UI Integration:**  Map the classified gestures to desired actions. Create the basic UI to display the detected gestures and executed actions.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system, identifying and addressing any inaccuracies or false positives.  Refine the gesture definitions and classifier as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly affect hand detection accuracy.  Consider implementing techniques to handle varying lighting conditions (e.g., adaptive thresholding).
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Defining distinct and easily recognizable micro-gestures is crucial to avoid ambiguity and false positives.  Careful selection and clear definition of gestures is vital.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** Gain practical experience using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand tracking.
- **Practical experience with gesture recognition:**  Develop skills in feature extraction, classifier design, and implementation for a gesture recognition system.
