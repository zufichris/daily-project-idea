# Minimalist Robotic Arm Path Planning with Collision Avoidance

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified path planning algorithm for a robotic arm to reach a target position while avoiding collisions with obstacles.  The emphasis is on a minimalist approach, prioritizing efficient implementation within a short timeframe, rather than incorporating complex algorithms. The significance lies in understanding the core concepts of path planning and collision detection in a practical, manageable context.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization and user interaction), NumPy (for numerical computation)
* **Optional:** A robotics simulator like V-REP or Gazebo (if hardware is unavailable).

## Features & Requirements

- **Target Point Input:**  The user should be able to specify the target (x, y) coordinates for the robotic arm's end effector.
- **Obstacle Representation:** Simple circular obstacles will be defined with their (x, y) coordinates and radius.
- **Basic Path Generation:**  A simple algorithm (e.g., straight-line path with collision checks) will generate a path from the arm's starting position to the target.
- **Collision Detection:** The algorithm must detect collisions between the arm's links (represented as line segments) and the obstacles.
- **Path Visualization:** Pygame will be used to visually represent the robot arm, obstacles, and the planned path.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a basic obstacle avoidance maneuver (e.g., slight path deviation) if a collision is detected.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add support for multiple obstacles.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the Pygame environment and define functions for drawing the arm, obstacles, and path.
2. **Collision Detection:** Implement a function to check for intersections between line segments (arm links) and circles (obstacles).
3. **Basic Path Planning:** Create a function that generates a straight-line path and checks for collisions.  If a collision is detected, the path should not be generated beyond the point of the collision.
4. **Visualization:** Integrate the path planning and collision detection functions to display the results in Pygame.
5. **User Interaction:** Allow the user to input the target coordinates and define the obstacle positions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Efficient Collision Detection:** Implementing an efficient collision detection algorithm is crucial for real-time performance. A simple approach like checking for line-circle intersection will suffice for this minimalist project.
- **Path Optimization:** While a straight-line path is simple, it might not always be optimal or feasible given the obstacles.  Improving this aspect could be an extension for a future iteration.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of path planning fundamentals:** This project will solidify understanding of basic path planning concepts and collision avoidance techniques.
- **Practical experience with collision detection:** The project provides hands-on experience in implementing and applying collision detection algorithms, a fundamental aspect of robotics and computer graphics.
