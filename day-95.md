# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system that controls a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition via a webcam.  The system will translate specific hand gestures into commands to manipulate the appliance's state (on/off, brightness/speed adjustment). This project demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and real-time control in a smart home environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  requests (for API interaction â€“ optional, depending on appliance API).
- **Hardware:** Webcam,  (Smart home appliance with API access - optional).
- **Software:** A suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:**  The system should accurately detect and classify predefined hand gestures (e.g., fist for ON, open palm for OFF, hand up/down for brightness/speed adjustment).
- **Appliance Control:** The detected gestures should translate into commands to control the chosen smart home appliance. (Lamp: ON/OFF, Brightness; Fan: ON/OFF, Speed).
- **User Interface:** A simple graphical interface displaying the recognized gesture and the appliance's current state.
- **Gesture Calibration:** Allow for user calibration of gesture recognition to improve accuracy.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle situations where hand gestures are not detected or are ambiguous.

- **Advanced Features:** Integration with a smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant, IFTTT) for broader appliance control.
- **Optional Feature:** Implement a model training component using a small dataset of custom gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Dependencies:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, requests). Configure the webcam and set up the project environment.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution. Define a set of gestures and their corresponding commands.
3. **Appliance Control:** Develop the logic to send commands based on recognized gestures.  If using an external API, integrate the requests library to interact with the appliance's API.  Otherwise, simulate control using print statements or local data manipulation.
4. **User Interface:** Create a basic GUI (e.g., using Tkinter or PyQt) to visualize the recognized gesture and appliance state.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the gesture recognition and command execution.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition, especially with diverse hand sizes and lighting conditions, might require careful parameter tuning and/or further model training.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing real-time processing with accuracy requires careful optimization of the code to maintain a smooth frame rate.  Consider using optimized functions and potentially reducing image resolution if needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision:**  Practical application of hand tracking and gesture recognition techniques using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Develop skills in real-time system design:** Experience in building a system that processes data in real-time and responds to external input (gestures).
