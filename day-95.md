# Real-time Object Tracking with Depth Estimation

## Overview
This project focuses on building a system that can track a specific object in real-time using a depth camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect) and display its 3D position and trajectory. This is a fundamental task in robotics and computer vision with applications in augmented reality, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. The daily challenge is to create a functional prototype capable of tracking a single, identifiable object.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn (optional for advanced feature extraction), Open3D (for 3D visualization)
- **Hardware:** Depth camera (Intel RealSense D435i recommended), computer with sufficient processing power.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera's field of view using color segmentation.
- **Depth Data Acquisition:** Acquire depth information from the camera to determine the object's distance.
- **3D Position Tracking:** Calculate and display the 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of the object's centroid in real-time.
- **Trajectory Visualization:** Display the object's movement path on a 2D or 3D visualization.
- **Basic User Interface:** Simple display showing the object's 3D coordinates and its trajectory.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Object recognition using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet) for more robust object identification.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Incorporate Kalman filtering for smoother trajectory estimation and noise reduction.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Calibration:** Install necessary libraries, connect the depth camera, and calibrate it if required.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement color-based object detection using OpenCV. This involves image thresholding and contour analysis to locate the object.
3. **Depth Data Processing:** Extract depth information for the detected object's centroid.
4. **3D Position Calculation:** Convert pixel coordinates and depth information into 3D world coordinates.
5. **Visualization & Display:** Display the 3D coordinates and plot the object's trajectory using a suitable library like Matplotlib or Open3D.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing of depth data can be computationally expensive. Optimize code for speed or consider using GPU acceleration.
- **Noise in Depth Data:** Depth cameras can produce noisy data. Implement smoothing techniques (e.g., median filtering) to improve accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of:** Real-time image processing, depth sensing, 3D coordinate transformations.
- **Develop practical skills in:**  Using OpenCV for computer vision tasks, integrating hardware (depth camera) with software.
