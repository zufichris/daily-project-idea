# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves building a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimalist game using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and understanding core RL concepts within a constrained timeframe.  The game will be a custom-designed, easily implemented environment, allowing for faster iteration and learning.  This showcases fundamental AI techniques in a practical and demonstrable manner.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow)
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., grid-based navigation to a goal, avoiding obstacles).
    - An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
    - An evaluation function to assess the agent's performance.
    - Basic visualization of the agent's actions and learning progress.
    - Saving and loading of trained models.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Adding a simple GUI for user interaction.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Design:** Create a simple 2D game environment using a library like Pygame or a custom implementation. Define states, actions, rewards, and the game's termination conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (start with Q-learning).  Implement the agent's logic to interact with the environment, learn from its experiences, and update its policy.
3. **Training Loop:** Design and implement a training loop that iteratively runs the agent in the environment, collecting data and updating the agent's knowledge.  Use a reasonable number of training iterations based on the time constraint.
4. **Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluate the agent's performance using a separate evaluation environment.  Visualize the learning curve (reward over time) and potentially the agent's actions within the game environment.
5. **Refinement & Saving:** Based on the evaluation, refine the agent's parameters or the reward function. Save the trained model for later use.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) for the chosen RL algorithm might require some experimentation within the time constraint.  Focus on a reasonable starting point and iterative refinement.
- **Environment Complexity:**  Balancing the simplicity of the environment with sufficient complexity to provide a meaningful learning challenge is crucial.  Avoid over-engineering the environment's complexity to stay within the time limit.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., Q-learning, reward functions, exploration-exploitation trade-off).
- Practical experience in implementing and training a simple AI agent.
