# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts, not creating a sophisticated, production-ready agent.  The game will be a simplified version of a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or a custom-designed, easily implemented environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A simple, deterministic game environment (e.g., 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe or a custom grid-based game) implemented using Gym or a custom framework.
- **Agent Implementation:**  A reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning or a simpler RL algorithm.
- **Training Loop:** A training loop that allows the agent to learn through interactions with the environment.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics to track the agent's performance (e.g., win rate, average reward).
- **Visualization (Optional):** A simple visualization of the game and the agent's learning progress.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implementing epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for better exploration-exploitation balance.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Saving and loading trained models for future use.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the game environment using a suitable framework (Gym or a custom implementation).  Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Design:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for its simplicity) and implement the agent logic.
3. **Training Loop Implementation:** Create a training loop that iteratively trains the agent, interacting with the environment, receiving rewards, and updating its policy.
4. **Evaluation and Iteration:** Evaluate the agent's performance using appropriate metrics and adjust parameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) to improve performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  If time permits, create a simple visualization to observe the agent's decision-making process and learning progress.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully designing the reward function is crucial to guide the agent's learning. A poorly designed reward function can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Overfitting:** With limited training time, the agent might overfit to the training data.  Techniques like early stopping or regularization might be necessary (depending on the complexity).


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcing understanding of fundamental reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., state, action, reward, policy).
- Practical experience in implementing a simple RL agent and evaluating its performance.
