# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The goal is to create a simple, intuitive, and contactless control interface, showcasing the integration of computer vision and IoT.  This is significant because it explores a user-friendly alternative to traditional methods like voice control or mobile apps.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi interaction, if using a physical appliance)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi (or similar microcontroller),  a connected smart appliance (e.g., smart bulb, fan with API), Webcam.
* **Software:** Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Detection:**  Accurately detect and track a hand in the webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize predefined gestures (e.g., open hand for on, closed fist for off, wave for brightness/speed control).
- **Appliance Control:**  Send appropriate commands to the chosen smart appliance based on recognized gestures.
- **Calibration:** Allow for initial calibration to adjust for lighting and hand size variations.
- **Visual Feedback:** Provide simple visual feedback on the screen indicating the recognized gesture and appliance state.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Appliance Control:** Extend to control multiple appliances simultaneously using different gestures.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Implement a machine learning model for improved gesture recognition accuracy and adaptability.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, RPi.GPIO if needed). Configure the connection to the smart appliance (API keys, network settings).
2. **Hand Detection & Tracking:** Implement hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution.  Visualize the hand landmarks on the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Define a set of simple gestures and map them to specific actions (on/off, brightness/speed levels). Create logic to classify gestures based on the hand landmark data.
4. **Appliance Control Integration:** Send commands to the chosen smart appliance based on the classified gestures using the appliance's API or direct hardware control (if using a Raspberry Pi).
5. **Visual Feedback & Refinement:**  Display visual feedback (e.g., text overlays) to show the recognized gesture and appliance state.  Test and refine the gesture recognition and control logic.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect hand detection accuracy.  Experiment with different image processing techniques to mitigate this.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Ensure clear differentiation between gestures to avoid misinterpretations. Consider using multiple frames for more robust gesture classification.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Techniques:** Gain practical experience with hand detection, tracking, and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **IoT Integration:** Develop skills in integrating software with smart home appliances and APIs for control and automation.
