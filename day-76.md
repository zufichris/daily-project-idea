# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a lightweight micro-gesture recognition system.  The system will identify simple hand gestures captured by a webcam or similar device and translate them into commands for controlling smart home appliances.  This reduces reliance on voice commands or physical interfaces, offering a novel and potentially more intuitive control method.  The focus will be on speed and efficiency in prototyping, prioritizing a minimal viable product (MVP) with expandable features.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (for gesture recognition), a relevant smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Tools:**  A webcam or similar video input device.  A suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Capture:** The system must capture and process video frames from the webcam in real-time.
- **Basic Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct gestures (e.g., wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for increasing volume, thumbs down for decreasing volume).
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Send commands to a simulated or real smart home environment (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume) based on recognized gestures.
- **GUI (Optional):**  A simple graphical user interface (GUI) to display recognized gestures and control parameters.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of situations where gestures are not correctly recognized.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, chosen smart home API). Set up a basic project structure.
2. **Gesture Capture and Preprocessing:** Implement code to capture video frames from the webcam and preprocess them (resizing, grayscale conversion, etc.) to optimize processing speed.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate MediaPipeâ€™s hand tracking capabilities to detect and identify predefined hand gestures.
4. **Smart Home Command Execution:**  Implement the logic to translate recognized gestures into corresponding commands (e.g., HTTP requests to the smart home API).
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions, refining the recognition accuracy and response times.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Robust preprocessing techniques will be crucial.
- **Gesture Variability:**  People perform gestures differently; the model needs to be tolerant of variations in gesture execution.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on experience with computer vision libraries:**  Gain practical experience using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Integration of different software components:**  Learn to effectively integrate various libraries and APIs to create a functional system.
