# Automated Bug Report Generation for Unit Tests

## Overview

This project aims to build a tool that automatically generates concise and informative bug reports from failed unit tests.  Instead of simply showing a "Test Failed" message, this tool will analyze the test failure, extract relevant code snippets, and generate a report including the failing test case, the expected and actual outputs, a stack trace, and potentially even suggested fixes based on common error patterns. This improves developer efficiency by streamlining the debugging process.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Testing Framework:** pytest (or similar, e.g., unittest)
- **Report Generation:**  ReportLab or similar library for generating PDF or HTML reports.
- **Code Analysis (Optional):**  Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) via Python's `ast` module for more advanced analysis.

## Features & Requirements

- **Test Failure Detection:** Automatically detect failed unit tests using a chosen testing framework.
- **Information Extraction:** Extract relevant information from the failed test, including the test name, error message, stack trace, expected and actual values.
- **Report Generation:** Generate a structured report containing the extracted information in a human-readable format (e.g., PDF or HTML).
- **Code Snippet Inclusion:** Include relevant code snippets from the failing test function and potentially surrounding code.
- **Basic Error Classification (Optional):** Categorize common error types (e.g., `TypeError`, `AssertionError`) for easier filtering and analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary libraries (pytest, ReportLab). Create a simple project structure with sample unit tests.
2. **Implement failure detection:** Use pytest's hooks or custom test runners to capture failed test events.
3. **Extract failure information:**  Parse the failure information (error message, stack trace, etc.) from the test runner's output.
4. **Generate report:** Use ReportLab or a similar library to create a PDF or HTML report containing the extracted information and code snippets.
5. **(Optional) Implement basic error classification:**  Add logic to categorize common error types from the exception type.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling diverse error types:**  Different testing frameworks and libraries might have varying ways of reporting failures; creating robust parsing logic is crucial.
- **Code snippet extraction:**  Accurately selecting relevant code snippets without including excessive amounts of unrelated code can be challenging.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Advanced testing practices:** This project reinforces the importance of robust unit testing and the value of automated reporting in efficient debugging.
- **Exception handling and error analysis:**  Gain experience in working with exceptions, parsing error messages, and extracting meaningful information from stack traces.
