# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implementing a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it. The game's simplicity allows for rapid prototyping, while the RL aspect introduces a challenging element, demonstrating the core principles of RL in a tangible application.  The goal is to create a functional agent capable of learning basic strategies within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), PyTorch (or TensorFlow) for RL implementation.
- **Tools:**  A Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game (e.g., a single-screen maze navigation or a simplified version of Pong).
    - A visual representation of the game using Pygame.
    - An RL agent that learns to play the game using a Q-learning algorithm.
    - Basic reward system (e.g., +1 for reaching a goal, -1 for hitting a wall).
    - Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting the cumulative reward over time).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementation of a different RL algorithm (e.g., SARSA).
    - Introduction of a more complex game environment with multiple states and actions.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Development:** Design and implement the basic mini-game using Pygame. Focus on a minimal, easily expandable design.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Create the RL agent using either PyTorch or TensorFlow. Implement the chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning).
3. **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop to iterate through game play, updating the agent's Q-values based on the rewards received.
4. **Visualization:** Implement a visualization component to monitor the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting the cumulative rewards over training episodes).
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Test the agent's performance and refine parameters as needed to optimize learning speed and effectiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) might require experimentation.  Start with common values and adjust as needed.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can hinder the agent's learning process. Ensure the reward system effectively guides the agent towards desired behavior.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: Gain practical experience with implementing and training an RL agent using Q-learning.
- Game Development Basics: Improve understanding of game development concepts through the creation of a simple 2D game using Pygame.
