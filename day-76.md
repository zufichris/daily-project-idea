# Robotic Arm Calibration & Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic system for calibrating and controlling a robotic arm using real-time hand gesture recognition from a depth camera. This will demonstrate the integration of computer vision, robotic control, and sensor calibration, focusing on a streamlined implementation suitable for a short timeframe. The system will allow users to control the robotic arm's end-effector position in 3D space using intuitive hand gestures.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking), PySerial (serial communication), Robotic Operating System (ROS) - optional for more advanced robot control.
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot Magician, UR3e), a depth camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect), a computer with sufficient processing power.
* **Tools:** A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Hand Gesture Recognition:**  Real-time recognition of predefined hand gestures (e.g., open hand for stop, clenched fist for grasp, pointing finger for movement direction).
- **Robotic Arm Control:**  Translation of recognized gestures into corresponding movements of the robotic arm's end-effector.
- **Calibration Routine:** A simple calibration process to map hand gestures to robotic arm joint angles or Cartesian coordinates.
- **Basic Error Handling:**  Implementation of basic error handling to manage unexpected gestures or communication failures.
- **Visualization:** Display of the recognized gestures and the robotic arm's current position.

- **Advanced Features:**  Integration with a force sensor for more precise grasp control.
- **Optional Feature:**  Implementation of a trajectory planning algorithm for smoother arm movements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Calibration:** Develop a simple calibration routine.  This might involve manually moving the robotic arm to a series of known positions while recording corresponding hand gestures.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.  Focus on a small set of essential gestures.
3. **Control Logic:** Develop the control logic to map recognized gestures to robotic arm commands. This may involve direct joint angle control or inverse kinematics if using a more complex arm.
4. **Communication:** Establish serial communication between the computer and the robotic arm. Send control commands to the arm based on recognized gestures.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different gestures and refine the calibration and control logic as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:** Achieving accurate gesture recognition and mapping to arm movements can be challenging due to noise and variations in hand poses.  Careful calibration and robust error handling are crucial.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing hand gestures and controlling the arm in real-time requires efficient algorithms and hardware with sufficient processing power.  Optimizing code for speed is vital.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:**  Gain practical experience in implementing real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.
- **Develop skills in robotic control:**  Learn to integrate computer vision data with robotic arm control,  gaining experience in serial communication and control algorithms.
