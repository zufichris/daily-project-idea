# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic self-balancing robot control system using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The goal is to implement and tune the PID controller to stabilize the robot on two wheels. This project is significant because it provides a hands-on experience with control systems, a critical area in robotics and automation.  A functional prototype demonstrates understanding of feedback control and parameter tuning.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID control), possibly Pygame or similar for visualization (optional).
* **Hardware:** A small two-wheeled robot platform (e.g., Arduino-based, or a simulated model using a physics engine like PyBullet), IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for angle and rate sensing.

## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Control:**  The robot should maintain its upright position against disturbances.
- **PID Implementation:**  A functional PID controller should be implemented and tuned to achieve stability.
- **Sensor Integration:** Accurate reading and interpretation of IMU data for angle and angular velocity.
- **Motor Control:**  Precise control of the robot's motors based on the PID controller output.
- **Real-time feedback:** Display the robot's angle, desired angle, and motor commands.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a Kalman filter to improve the accuracy of the IMU readings.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add a user interface (GUI) to adjust PID parameters in real-time.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Sensor Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Calibrate the IMU and acquire initial angle and angular velocity data.  If using simulation, set up the initial robot state and sensor readings.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID algorithm in Python using NumPy/SciPy.  Initialize PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) with reasonable starting values.
3. **Motor Control Integration:**  Connect the PID output to the robot's motor control mechanism (PWM signals for motors in Arduino-based systems).  For simulation, directly apply motor commands to change robot's angular velocity.
4. **Tuning and Testing:**  Systematically tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal stability. Observe the robot's response to disturbances and adjust gains accordingly.
5. **Data Visualization (Optional):** If time permits, visualize the robot's angle, PID output, and motor commands over time using a plotting library like Matplotlib.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gain values can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with conservative values and gradually increase them.
- **Noise in Sensor Readings:**  IMU data might contain noise. This could affect the performance of the PID controller. Consider implementing a simple moving average filter to reduce the noise.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of PID control:** This project provides practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller.
- **Develop proficiency in sensor integration and real-time control:**  It involves working with sensor data and integrating it into a control system for real-time feedback.
