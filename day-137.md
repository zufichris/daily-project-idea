# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview
This project aims to build a basic system for a robotic arm to detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in real-time using a camera feed. This demonstrates fundamental computer vision and robotics integration, suitable for a rapid prototyping challenge.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, potentially a robotics library like ROS (if a physical robot is available, otherwise simulation can be used)
- **Hardware (Optional):** A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR5), a webcam or camera.
- **Software:** A robotics simulator (e.g., Gazebo, V-REP) if no physical robot is available.

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:** Detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using color thresholding or a simple object detector.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position frame-by-frame.
- **Position Reporting:** Display the object's coordinates (x, y) in the image.
- **Arm Control (Optional):** If a robotic arm is available, send the object's coordinates to control the arm's end effector to follow the object.
- **GUI:** A simple display showing the camera feed, object bounding box, and object coordinates.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy). Set up a camera feed (real or simulated). If using a robot arm, establish communication with it.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement color thresholding or a simpler object detection algorithm (e.g., Haar cascades for a more complex object) to detect the target object in each frame.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use a simple tracking algorithm like centroid tracking to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Position Reporting:** Display the object's coordinates (x, y) on the image and/or the console.
5. **Arm Control (Optional):** If using a robot, translate the object's image coordinates to robot arm coordinates and send commands to the arm to move its end effector accordingly.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Lighting Conditions:** Changes in lighting can significantly affect color thresholding accuracy.  Robust solutions might involve adaptive thresholding or more advanced techniques.
- **Object Occlusion:** If the object is temporarily obscured, the tracking algorithm might lose it. Implementing a more sophisticated tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) could mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Practical experience with image processing, object detection, and tracking.
- **Robotics Integration (Optional):** Understanding how to integrate computer vision with robotic control systems, mapping image coordinates to robot coordinates.
