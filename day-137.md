# Automated Code Style Checker with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to build a command-line tool that automatically checks the style of Python code based on a customizable set of rules. This is significant because consistent code style enhances readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.  The tool will go beyond basic linters by allowing users to define their own style preferences.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Tree parsing), `argparse` (for command-line argument parsing), `pycodestyle` (or `flake8` for a more comprehensive linter as a starting point),  `yaml` (for rule configuration file).

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule-based checking:**  The tool should analyze Python code and identify violations against a predefined set of rules.
- **Customizable rules:** Users should be able to define their own rules (e.g., maximum line length, naming conventions) via a configuration file (YAML format).
- **Clear output:** The tool should clearly report violations with line numbers and descriptions.
- **Severity levels:** Allow users to assign severity levels (e.g., warning, error) to each rule.
- **Configurable output format:**  JSON or text output.

- **Advanced features (Optional):** Rule grouping and weighted severity.
- **Advanced features (Optional):** Automatic code formatting based on defined rules (partial implementation).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Core Linting Functionality:** Integrate `pycodestyle` or `flake8` to perform basic style checks.  Focus on a small, manageable set of rules initially.
2. **YAML Configuration:** Implement YAML parsing to load custom rules defined in a configuration file.  Start with simple key-value pairs for rules.
3. **Custom Rule Implementation:** Develop the logic to parse the abstract syntax tree (AST) and enforce the custom rules loaded from the YAML file.
4. **Output Generation:** Generate a clear report of violations, including line numbers and descriptions.  Implement JSON output as an optional feature.
5. **Command-line Interface:** Use `argparse` to create a user-friendly command-line interface.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **AST Parsing Complexity:**  Parsing the AST and implementing complex custom rules can be challenging.  Start with simple rules and gradually increase complexity.
- **Handling various Python versions:** Ensure compatibility across different Python versions.  Focus on a single version initially for simplicity.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Advanced Python programming:**  This project reinforces skills in AST manipulation, custom library integration, and command-line tool development.
- **Software design principles:** Working with configurable rules encourages modular design and promotes separation of concerns.
