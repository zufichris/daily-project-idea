# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI-powered Suggestions

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype of an AI-powered code style enforcement tool that not only detects violations but also suggests intelligent corrections, significantly speeding up the code review process. The focus will be on a single programming language (e.g., Python) to maintain the daily scope.  This is particularly significant for teams maintaining large codebases where consistent style is crucial.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Tree manipulation),  `flake8` (for linting),  a suitable Machine Learning library (e.g., scikit-learn or a simpler model if time is constrained), potentially a language model API like OpenAI's Codex or similar.
- **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE with Python support (VS Code, PyCharm).  Version control (Git) is recommended.


## Features & Requirements

- **Code Linting & Violation Detection:** The tool should identify style violations based on a pre-defined style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- **AI-powered Suggestion Generation:** For identified violations, the tool should suggest potential corrections based on trained data or a language model.  These suggestions should be context-aware and semantically correct.
- **Interactive User Interface (CLI):**  A simple command-line interface to process code files and display violations and suggestions.
- **Configurable Style Guide:** Allow users to customize the style guide or easily switch between different style guides.
- **Violation Reporting:** Generate a report summarizing the detected violations and suggested corrections.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gather a dataset of code snippets with and without style violations.  Preprocess the data for use with the chosen machine learning model. (If using a language model API, this step can be simplified).
2. **Model Training (or API Integration):** Train a machine learning model to predict corrections for violations (or set up integration with a language model API). Focus on a manageable scope â€“ one or two specific violation types.
3. **Code Analysis Engine:** Implement the core logic to parse code using `ast`, detect violations using `flake8`, and fetch suggestions using the trained model or API.
4. **CLI Development:** Build a simple command-line interface to interact with the analysis engine and display results.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the tool on various code samples and refine the model or rules as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Accuracy:**  Achieving high accuracy in code correction suggestions within a short time frame might be challenging.  Consider focusing on a limited set of easily correctable violations.
- **Computational Resources:** Training complex models might require significant computational resources, potentially limiting the scope of the project if working on a local machine without access to cloud computing.  A simpler model or pre-trained language model API could mitigate this.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Machine Learning:** This project provides hands-on experience in applying machine learning techniques to a real-world software engineering problem.
- **Code Analysis & Static Analysis Tools:**  Gain deeper understanding of code analysis techniques and the use of tools like `flake8` and `ast`.
