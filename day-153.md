#  Miniature Autonomous Line Following Robot Simulation

## Overview

This project involves creating a simulated miniature autonomous line-following robot using a physics engine and a simple control algorithm. The purpose is to design, implement, and test a basic control system in a controlled environment before transitioning to real-world hardware. This simulation allows for rapid prototyping and iterative development of the control logic without the complexities of physical robot construction.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Physics Engine:** Pygame or Pymunk (for 2D physics simulation)
* **IDE:**  VS Code, PyCharm, or any Python-compatible IDE.
* **Libraries:**  NumPy (for numerical computation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Line Detection:** The simulated robot should accurately detect a black line on a white background (or vice versa).
- **Motor Control:**  Implement a simple proportional controller to adjust motor speeds based on the line's position relative to the robot's sensor.
- **Robot Movement:** The robot should move autonomously along the line, staying centered as much as possible.
- **Line Following Algorithm:**  Implement a PID controller or a simpler proportional controller for line following.
- **Simulation Visualization:**  The simulation should visually represent the robot, the line, and its sensors.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., fuzzy logic).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Add noise to the sensor readings to simulate real-world imperfections.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pygame/Pymunk, NumPy) and create the project structure.
2. **Create the Robot and Line:**  Define the robot's characteristics (shape, size, sensor position) and draw a line path in the simulation window.
3. **Implement Line Detection:**  Write a function to detect the line's position relative to the robot's sensor.
4. **Develop the Control Algorithm:** Implement a proportional or PID controller to adjust motor speeds based on the line detection.
5. **Integrate and Test:** Combine all components and test the robot's ability to follow the line.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Tuning:** Finding the optimal gains for the proportional or PID controller can be challenging and require iterative adjustments.
- **Sensor Noise Handling:** (Optional)  Simulating sensor noise and designing a robust control system to handle it requires careful consideration.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce Control System Design:** This project provides hands-on experience in designing and implementing basic control algorithms.
- **Mastering Simulation Techniques:**  Gain practical experience in utilizing a physics engine for robotics simulation and prototyping.
