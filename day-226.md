# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a 2D game using reinforcement learning techniques.  The game will be a minimalist environment, focusing on the core RL implementation rather than complex graphics.  The significance lies in quickly prototyping and experimenting with different RL algorithms and hyperparameters to observe their impact on agent performance.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for game environment)
- Stable Baselines3 (for RL algorithms)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items).
    - An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C).
    - Basic reward system to guide the agent's learning.
    - Visualization of the agent's actions and rewards within the game.
    - Ability to save and load trained models.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more complex reward function incorporating penalties for inefficient movements.
    - Experimenting with different RL algorithms beyond PPO/A2C.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Environment:** Design a simple 2D game using Pygame.  Define the game's rules, states, and actions. Create a reward function.
2. **Choose an RL Algorithm:** Select a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm from Stable Baselines3 (e.g., PPO).
3. **Train the Agent:**  Train the AI agent using the chosen algorithm on the defined game environment. Experiment with hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Evaluate Performance:**  Test the trained agent's ability to achieve the game's objective.  Visualize the agent's learning process and final performance.
5. **Save and Document:** Save the trained model and document the experiment setup, hyperparameters, and results.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require iterative experimentation and adjustments.
- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that appropriately guides the agent's learning can be challenging.  An improperly designed reward function might lead to unexpected behavior.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning Principles: Gain practical experience implementing and tuning reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Agent-Environment Interaction: Understand the interaction between an AI agent and its environment in the context of RL.
