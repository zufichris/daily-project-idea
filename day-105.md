# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic self-balancing robotic arm controlled via a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The focus is on implementing and tuning the PID controller to achieve stable balancing, demonstrating a fundamental control system concept within a short timeframe. This is a practical application of control theory and can be visualized and tested easily.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below)
- **Framework/Library:**  Pygame (for visualization and basic control interface), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A simple robotic arm kit (e.g., a small servo-controlled arm) and an Arduino or similar microcontroller (for physical implementation - simulation is possible without hardware).
- **Simulation Environment:**  VPython (for 3D simulation if hardware isn't available).

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balancing:** The robotic arm should maintain a stable upright position, resisting external disturbances (simulated or physical).
- **PID Controller Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to adjust the servo motor(s) to maintain balance.  The controller's gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) should be tunable.
- **Angle Measurement:**  Accurate measurement of the arm's angle from vertical is crucial. This can be simulated or read from a physical sensor.
- **Visualization:** A simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame to display the arm's position and controller output.
- **User Input (Optional):** Ability to apply simulated external forces or disturbances to the arm.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implementing a Kalman filter for noise reduction in angle measurement.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Adding a trajectory following capability -  the arm should move to a specified target angle while maintaining balance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Simulation/Hardware Integration:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and establish communication with the hardware (if using). Create a simplified model of the robotic arm (either in simulation or based on the hardware specifications).
2. **Angle Measurement & Feedback:** Implement a function to measure the arm's angle. If using simulation, this is a simple calculation; if using hardware, it involves reading sensor data.  This data acts as the feedback for the PID controller.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement the PID control algorithm.  Initially, use simple values for Kp, Ki, and Kd.
4. **Tuning and Testing:**  Test the system, observing the arm's response. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) iteratively to achieve stable balancing. This will likely involve trial and error.
5. **Visualization & Refinement:** Implement the Pygame GUI to visualize the arm's position and controller output.  Refine the PID parameters to optimize performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains for stable balancing can be challenging and time-consuming.  Trial and error, along with understanding the effect of each gain, is key.
- **Sensor Noise (Hardware):** If using physical hardware, sensor noise might affect the accuracy of the angle measurement, requiring techniques like filtering.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Controller Design & Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental algorithm in control systems.
- **Real-time Control Systems:** Understand the challenges and considerations of designing and implementing real-time control systems, where precise timing and responsiveness are critical.
