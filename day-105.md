# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking using a Webcam

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simple real-time object detection and tracking system using a webcam.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and track its movement within the camera's field of view.  This provides a practical application of computer vision techniques and reinforces fundamental concepts in image processing and object tracking.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with a sufficient CPU/GPU for real-time processing.

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the webcam feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across frames.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object in real-time.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to evaluate performance.
- **Color Thresholding:** Use color thresholding techniques for object detection.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Object Tracking:** Track multiple instances of the defined object.
- **Object Classification:** Implement a more sophisticated object detection model (e.g., using a pre-trained YOLO or SSD model).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Initialization:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy). Initialize the webcam and configure video capture.
2. **Color Thresholding & Object Detection:** Define the color range for the target object (e.g., red). Apply color thresholding to the webcam feed to isolate the object.  Find contours and determine the object's centroid.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use the centroid from the previous frame to predict the object's location in the current frame. Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter for smoother tracking).
4. **Bounding Box & FPS Display:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object. Calculate and display the FPS.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and object distances. Refine the color thresholding parameters for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Lighting Variations:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact color thresholding accuracy.  Consider using techniques to compensate for these variations (e.g., adaptive thresholding).
- **Object Occlusion:**  If the object is partially or fully occluded, the tracking algorithm might lose track.  Robust tracking algorithms can handle this more effectively, but a simpler implementation might require restarting detection.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Image Processing Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with image processing techniques like color thresholding and contour detection.
- **Object Tracking Algorithms:** Understand the basic principles of object tracking and implement a simple tracking algorithm.
