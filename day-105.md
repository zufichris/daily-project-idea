# Automated Code Style Checker with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet customizable command-line tool that automatically checks the style of Python code against a user-defined set of rules. This goes beyond standard linters by allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different stylistic preferences. The project focuses on core functionality within a limited timeframe, with potential for expansion.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python 3:**  Programming language.
- **`ast` module (Python):** For parsing Python code.
- **`argparse` module (Python):** For command-line argument parsing.
- **Text-based user interface (optional):**  For a more user-friendly experience (e.g., using `curses` or a simple library).

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:** Ability to specify custom style rules (e.g., maximum line length, indentation style, spacing around operators) via a simple configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML).
- **Code Parsing & Analysis:**  Parse Python code using the `ast` module and check it against the defined rules.
- **Error Reporting:** Report any style violations with clear line numbers and descriptions.
- **Output Formatting:** Present the results in a concise and readable format.
- **Configurable Severity Levels:**  Allow users to define the severity level (warning, error) for each rule.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Integration with a code formatter (e.g., `black`) to automatically fix some style violations.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Support for multiple file processing or directory traversal.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Rule Definition & Parsing:** Create a data structure (e.g., a dictionary) to represent the style rules and implement functions to load and parse the rule configuration file.
2. **Code Parser:** Implement functions using the `ast` module to traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the Python code and check it against the loaded style rules.
3. **Error Reporting & Output:** Implement functions to generate informative error messages, including file names, line numbers, and rule violations.  Format the output for easy readability.
4. **Command-Line Interface:** Use `argparse` to create a command-line interface to accept file paths and rule configuration file paths as input.
5. **Testing:**  Write unit tests to validate rule checking and output formatting.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Complex Python Syntax:**  The `ast` module might require careful handling of complex Python syntax structures like nested functions and decorators.  Focus on handling common scenarios first.
- **Performance Optimization:**  For larger codebases, performance could become an issue.  Consider optimizing parsing and rule checking algorithms if time permits.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Advanced Python Programming:**  Reinforces skills in using advanced Python modules like `ast` and `argparse`.
- **Code Analysis & Static Analysis:** Gain experience in analyzing code structure and identifying style violations, a critical skill in software development.
