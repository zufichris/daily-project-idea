#  AI-Powered Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice

## Overview

This project aims to build a rudimentary voice-controlled smart home appliance system using a pre-trained speech-to-text model and a simple control interface.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the core functionalities, not a full-fledged, production-ready system. The significance lies in learning to integrate AI services with hardware control, even with constraints on time and resources.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `speech_recognition`, `pyaudio`, `requests` (or equivalent for your chosen API)
- **Hardware:** A Raspberry Pi (or similar microcontroller) with internet access, a microphone, and the ability to control at least one appliance (e.g., a smart plug).  A virtual environment is recommended.
- **API:**  A cloud-based speech-to-text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AssemblyAI) and potentially a cloud-based home automation platform API (if controlling more than a simple on/off switch).


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Recognition:**  Accurately transcribe spoken commands related to appliance control ("Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the coffee maker").
- **Command Parsing:**  Interpret the transcribed speech to identify the target appliance and the desired action.
- **Appliance Control:** Send appropriate commands to the target appliance via its API or a direct serial/GPIO connection.
- **Error Handling:**  Provide feedback to the user in case of invalid commands, network issues, or appliance malfunctions.
- **Basic Logging:** Log voice commands, actions taken, and any errors encountered.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement simple natural language understanding (NLU) to handle variations in command phrasing (e.g., "Switch the light on").
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a simple user interface (e.g., a web interface or an LCD screen on the Raspberry Pi) to display status information.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the chosen speech-to-text API. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the appliance(s).
2. **Implement voice recognition:** Write a Python script to capture audio input, send it to the chosen API for transcription, and process the received text.
3. **Develop command parsing:** Create a function to parse the transcribed text, identify the appliance and the action, and extract relevant parameters (if necessary).
4. **Implement appliance control:** Integrate the control logic based on the parsed commands (e.g., send HTTP requests to a smart plug API or use GPIO pins for direct control).
5. **Test and refine:** Test the system with various commands, handle errors, and iterate based on the results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:**  The accuracy of speech-to-text can be affected by noise and accent.  Handle potential misrecognitions gracefully.
- **API Limitations:**  Free tiers of speech-to-text APIs often have usage limits, and the API responses might need careful parsing.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Integrating AI services into embedded systems:**  Gain experience with connecting cloud-based AI services (speech-to-text) to a physical device.
- **Rapid prototyping:**  Develop and test a functional prototype with limited time and resources, emphasizing iterative development.
