# Mini-Max Agent for a Simplified Game

## Overview

This project involves creating a Minimax AI agent to play a simplified version of a two-player game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, focusing on efficient implementation and potentially incorporating alpha-beta pruning for optimization.  The goal is to build a functional AI opponent within a short timeframe, highlighting AI algorithm implementation and game tree traversal.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: `numpy` (optional, for efficient array representation of the game board), potentially a game-specific library if one exists for the chosen game.

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game board (graphical or text-based).
    - A Minimax AI agent capable of making moves.
    - A human player interface for interaction.
    - Determination of win/loss/draw conditions.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Alpha-beta pruning implementation for improved search efficiency.
    - Different difficulty levels adjustable by search depth.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board Representation:** Define a data structure (e.g., list, NumPy array) to represent the game board and functions for making moves and checking win conditions.
2. **Minimax Algorithm:** Implement the Minimax algorithm recursively, evaluating game states and selecting the optimal move for the AI agent.
3. **Human Player Interface:** Create a simple interface (CLI or basic GUI) allowing the human player to input moves.
4. **Game Loop:** Integrate the game board, AI agent, and human player interface into a main game loop to control the game flow.
5. **(Optional) Alpha-Beta Pruning:**  Integrate alpha-beta pruning into the Minimax algorithm to improve performance, particularly for larger game boards.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:** Minimax can become computationally expensive for games with large branching factors.  Limiting the search depth is a practical solution for a daily challenge.
- **Heuristic Function (Optional):** For more complex games, designing an effective heuristic function to evaluate non-terminal game states might be challenging if not using alpha-beta pruning.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforces understanding of the Minimax algorithm and its application in game AI.
- Provides practical experience in implementing recursive algorithms and handling game state transitions.
