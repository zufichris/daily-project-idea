# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated self-balancing two-wheeled robot.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing and controlled movement using a simple, yet effective control algorithm.  This provides a practical application of PID control, a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems engineering.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Optional:**  A robotics simulation environment (like PyBullet or V-REP) for a more realistic simulation.

## Features & Requirements
- **Self-Balancing:** The robot should maintain its upright position despite disturbances (e.g., simulated wind or initial imbalances).
- **Motor Control:**  The PID controller should accurately control the speed of both motors to achieve balance.
- **Angle Measurement:**  Accurate measurement of the robot's angle using a simulated sensor.
- **User Input (Optional):** Ability to control the robot's forward and backward movement using keyboard input.
- **Visualization:**  A graphical representation of the robot's state (angle, motor speeds) using Pygame.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Robot Model:** Create a simplified 2D model of the robot using classes in Python.  Define the robot's physical properties (mass, wheel radius, etc.).
2. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement the PID controller algorithm. Initialize the proportional, integral, and derivative gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) with initial values.
3. **Simulation Loop:**  Create a main loop that simulates the robot's dynamics using numerical integration (e.g., Euler's method). Update the robot's angle and angular velocity based on motor outputs from the PID controller.
4. **PID Tuning:**  Iteratively adjust Kp, Ki, and Kd to achieve optimal performance. Observe the robot's response to disturbances and fine-tune the gains to minimize oscillations and settling time.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Integrate Pygame to display the robot's position and angle in real-time.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments and experimentation.  Using a systematic approach (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method) can help.
- **Numerical Integration:**  The choice of numerical integration method can affect the accuracy and stability of the simulation.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control:**  Gain practical experience in implementing and tuning PID controllers, a fundamental technique in robotics and control systems.
- **System Modeling and Simulation:**  Develop skills in modeling dynamic systems and simulating their behavior using programming.
