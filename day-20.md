# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam.  The system will interpret simple hand gestures to trigger specific smart home actions, offering a novel and intuitive control method compared to voice or app-based solutions.  This is a simplified version focusing on speed and proof-of-concept.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation), a suitable smart home control library (e.g., homeassistant API).
- **Hardware:** Webcam, computer (laptop or desktop)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time gesture detection:**  The system should accurately recognize predefined hand gestures (e.g., open hand for lights on, closed fist for lights off, thumb up for increasing volume).
- **Smart home integration:**  Detected gestures should trigger actions like turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or controlling other smart devices (limited scope, maybe just simulated actions for a day-long project).
- **User interface:** A simple visualization of the detected gesture and the corresponding action triggered (text-based is sufficient).
- **Calibration:** An initial calibration step to adapt to lighting conditions and user's hand size.
- **Error handling:**  Gracefully handle cases where gestures are not clearly recognized.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple users:** Support for multiple users with personalized gesture profiles.
- **Gesture customization:** Allow users to define their own gestures and mappings to smart home actions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and test the webcam connection using OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Implement real-time gesture recognition using MediaPipe's pose estimation, focusing on a limited set of predefined gestures.  Use thresholds and basic image processing for robustness.
3. **Smart Home Action Mapping:**  Create a simple mapping between recognized gestures and specific smart home commands (initially simulated; consider a mock API for simplicity).
4. **User Interface Development:** Create a basic user interface to display recognized gestures and triggered actions (can be a simple console output).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and user hand movements. Refine the gesture recognition thresholds and action mappings as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time performance:** Balancing accuracy and speed for real-time gesture recognition can be challenging, especially with limited processing power. Optimization techniques may be needed.
- **Robustness to noise:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, background, and hand movements requires careful consideration of image processing techniques and thresholding.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time computer vision:** Gain practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and pose estimation.
- **Application development:** Develop a simple but functional application integrating computer vision with a smart home control system.
