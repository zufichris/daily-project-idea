# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning. The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstration of core RL concepts, not on achieving superhuman performance.  The significance lies in understanding and implementing the fundamental building blocks of RL in a concise and manageable project.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), NumPy, Gym (optional, for environment creation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional implementation of the chosen game (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) with a clear win/lose/draw condition.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An agent that learns optimal strategies through trial and error using a simple RL algorithm like Q-learning.
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the agent against itself or a random opponent.
- **Evaluation Metric:**  A way to quantitatively measure the agent's performance (e.g., win rate).
- **Visualization:** A simple visualization of the game state and the agent's decision-making process (optional, but recommended).

- **Advanced Feature:**  Incorporate an ε-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm like Deep Q-Network (DQN) if time permits.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game's rules, state representation, and reward function in Python.  If using Gym, leverage its pre-built environments; otherwise, create a custom environment.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement the chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning or DQN).  Start with a simple Q-table for Q-learning.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a loop to train the agent, playing numerous games against itself or a random opponent.  Track the agent's performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation and Refinement:**  Evaluate the agent's performance. Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, ε) as needed to improve performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Add visualization to show the game board, agent's moves, and performance over time.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can be challenging and may require experimentation.
- **Overfitting:**  If the state space is small (like Tic-Tac-Toe), the agent might overfit to the training data.  Consider using techniques like experience replay (for DQN) to mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with core RL concepts like state, action, reward, and Q-learning/DQN.
- **Python Programming and Libraries:** Strengthen skills in using Python for scientific computing and working with machine learning libraries (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
