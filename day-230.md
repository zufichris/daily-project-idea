# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple computer vision system for calibrating the end-effector position of a robotic arm.  The system will use a known target (e.g., a checkerboard) and a camera to determine the robot's current pose and adjust its calibration parameters accordingly. This is crucial for accurate robotic manipulation tasks and can be a significant improvement over manual calibration methods.  The focus will be on a simplified, single-axis calibration for a day's work.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, potentially a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, specific manufacturer library if available)
- **Hardware:** Robotic arm (even a small, single-axis servo would suffice), Webcam or USB camera, Checkerboard target.


## Features & Requirements

- **Target Detection:**  Accurately detect the checkerboard pattern in the camera image using OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners`.
- **Pose Estimation:** Calculate the pose (position and orientation) of the checkerboard relative to the camera.
- **Calibration Adjustment:**  Based on the detected pose, adjust the robot arm's calibration parameters (e.g., a single offset value for a single-axis system).
- **Feedback Loop (Optional):** Implement a rudimentary feedback loop to iteratively refine the calibration.
- **Visualization:** Display the detected checkerboard corners and calculated pose on the camera feed.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries, connect the camera and robotic arm, and define the checkerboard parameters (size, number of corners).
2. **Image Acquisition & Processing:** Capture an image, detect the checkerboard, and calculate its pose using OpenCV's functions.
3. **Calibration Adjustment:**  Compare the detected checkerboard position to the expected position (based on the robot's reported position), and calculate a correction factor. Adjust the robot's internal calibration accordingly.
4. **Verification:**  Repeat steps 2 and 3 to verify improved accuracy.  Consider adding a simple test movement to validate the correction.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Overlay the calculated pose on the camera feed for visualization.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Camera Calibration:** Pre-calibrating the camera is crucial for accurate pose estimation. This could be done quickly using OpenCV's built-in calibration routines if time allows, otherwise, assuming a default intrinsic matrix can be a feasible simplification.
- **Robot Arm Control:**  The complexity of this step will heavily depend on the robotic arm's control interface.  For a single-axis system, this should be relatively straightforward, but multi-axis systems will require more advanced control mechanisms.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** This project reinforces the use of OpenCV for image processing, feature detection, and pose estimation.
- **Robotic Calibration:**  Understanding the principles of robotic arm calibration and implementing a simple calibration system using computer vision techniques.
