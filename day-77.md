# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up/down, wave, fist) and trigger corresponding actions like turning lights on/off or adjusting volume. This demonstrates a compact and intuitive alternative to voice or touch-based interfaces.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), PyAutoGUI (screen automation)
- **Tools:** Webcam, Jupyter Notebook/IDE

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures with high accuracy (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, wave).
- **Action Mapping:** Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., thumbs up = increase volume, thumbs down = decrease volume, wave = turn lights off).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **User Calibration:** Allow the user to calibrate the system to their specific hand gestures.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling to manage situations where gestures are not recognized clearly.

- **Advanced Features:**  Gesture sequence recognition (e.g., two waves to turn off all lights), integration with a specific smart home API (e.g., Philips Hue).
- **Optional Feature:**  Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier action mapping and configuration.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture a dataset of hand gestures using the webcam. Preprocess the images (resizing, grayscale conversion, noise reduction).
2. **Model Training (if needed):**  If not using a pre-trained model like MediaPipe, train a simple machine learning model (e.g., SVM, k-NN) to classify the gestures based on the preprocessed images.  MediaPipe is preferred for a rapid prototype.
3. **Gesture Recognition & Action Mapping:** Integrate MediaPipe or the trained model to recognize gestures from the webcam feed in real-time. Implement logic to map gestures to smart home actions using PyAutoGUI or a smart home API.
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with various lighting conditions and hand positions. Refine the model or parameters as needed to improve accuracy.
5. **User Interface (Optional):**  Develop a basic GUI using a library like Tkinter to provide a more user-friendly interface for calibration and action mapping.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of gesture recognition. Consider using image preprocessing techniques to mitigate this.
- **Hand Pose Variability:**  Individual hand sizes and styles can affect recognition accuracy. User calibration is crucial to address this.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques for computer vision applications.
- **Real-time System Development:**  Develop and test a real-time application that processes data from a continuous input stream (webcam).
