# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection using intelligent control algorithms to optimize traffic flow.  The goal is to prototype a basic system capable of adjusting traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle density at each approach.  This is a scaled-down version of a complex real-world problem, focusing on core algorithmic concepts.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
* **Tools:** A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Simulate vehicles arriving at the intersection randomly at varying rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller (e.g., fixed-time, or a simple adaptive algorithm).
- **Vehicle Movement:**  Simulate vehicle movement through the intersection based on traffic light states.
- **Density Detection:**  Track the number of vehicles waiting at each approach.
- **Visualization:**  Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light states graphically using Pygame.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated adaptive control algorithm (e.g., a simple reinforcement learning approach).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add different vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses) with varying speeds and priorities.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Basic Structure:** Create the Pygame window, define the intersection layout (roads, traffic lights), and initialize vehicle parameters.
2. **Vehicle Generation and Movement:** Implement functions to generate vehicles randomly and update their positions based on traffic light states and speed.
3. **Traffic Light Control (Basic):** Implement a simple fixed-time traffic light controller to alternate between green and red for each approach.
4. **Density Detection and Visualization:**  Count vehicles at each approach and update the display accordingly.
5. **(Optional) Adaptive Control Implementation:** If time permits, implement a simple adaptive algorithm that adjusts traffic light timings based on detected vehicle density.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:** Balancing the complexity of the adaptive control algorithm with the time constraint. A simple rule-based approach may be more suitable for a day's work.
- **Visualization Performance:**  Ensuring smooth visualization with a large number of simulated vehicles may require optimization techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithmic Design:**  Reinforce skills in designing and implementing algorithms for traffic control and optimization.
- **Simulation Techniques:** Gain experience in building and visualizing a simplified simulation of a real-world system.
