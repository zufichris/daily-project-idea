# Automated Code Style Enforcer with Real-time Feedback

## Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight, real-time code style enforcer that provides immediate feedback to developers as they type.  The tool will focus on a specific subset of style rules for a chosen language (e.g., Python's PEP 8) to make it manageable within a short timeframe.  This provides a practical application of real-time code analysis and improves coding consistency.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with a focus on speed and efficiency).
- **Libraries:** `pylint`, `rope` (or similar for code parsing and manipulation), `Tkinter` or `PyQt` (for GUI).
- **Tools:**  A code editor with a plugin API (e.g., VS Code) or a custom editor utilizing a GUI framework.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Style Checking:**  The tool should analyze code as it's being typed and highlight style violations immediately.
- **Rule Customization:**  Allow users to select a predefined set of style rules (e.g., line length, indentation, spacing).
- **Error Highlighting:**  Clearly indicate style violations directly in the code editor using visual cues (e.g., underlines, color-coding).
- **Automatic Correction (Optional):** Offer suggestions or automatically correct minor style issues.
- **Customizable Severity Levels:** Allow users to set different severity levels for various style rules, filtering out less critical issues.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Core Functionality:** Implement basic style checking for a subset of rules using `pylint` or a similar library.  Focus on parsing the code and identifying violations.
2. **GUI Integration:** Integrate the analysis with a simple GUI (e.g., using `Tkinter`). Display violations directly within the editor or a separate pane.
3. **Real-time Feedback:**  Use event handling to trigger analysis on every keystroke (or small batches of keystrokes) to avoid performance bottlenecks.
4. **Rule Customization:** Implement a mechanism (e.g., a configuration file or GUI settings) to allow users to enable/disable specific rules.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the functionality thoroughly with various code samples and refine the performance and feedback mechanisms.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Performance:** Real-time analysis of large codebases can be computationally expensive.  Efficient algorithms and optimized code are crucial to achieve acceptable performance. Consider batching analysis or using incremental parsing techniques.
- **GUI Responsiveness:**  Ensure the GUI remains responsive even during intensive code analysis.  Proper threading or asynchronous processing will be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Real-time code analysis:** Gain practical experience in building tools that perform analysis on code as it's being written.
- **GUI development with code integration:** Strengthen skills in combining back-end analysis with a user-friendly interface, learning about event handling and responsiveness within a GUI context.
