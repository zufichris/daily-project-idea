# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implementing a basic AI agent using reinforcement learning to play it.  The goal is to create a functional prototype demonstrating the fundamentals of reinforcement learning within a limited timeframe.  This project is significant because it allows for a hands-on experience with RL, a powerful technique increasingly used in game AI and robotics.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Reinforcement Learning Library: Stable Baselines3 or similar (e.g., Ray RLlib)
- Game Engine/Library: Pygame (for simplicity)
- Version Control: Git


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game (e.g., a Pong clone or a simple grid-based movement game).
    - A basic AI agent that uses a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network or Proximal Policy Optimization).
    - Training loop that allows the AI agent to learn through interactions with the game environment.
    - Visualization of the game and the AI agent's performance (e.g., score over time).
- **Optional Advanced Features:**
    - Implementing different reinforcement learning algorithms for comparison.
    - Incorporating a simple reward shaping mechanism to guide the AI's learning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create a basic playable game using Pygame.  Focus on simplicity and clear game mechanics.
2. **Environment Wrapper:** Develop a wrapper around the Pygame game to integrate it with the chosen reinforcement learning library. This wrapper should define the observation space (game state), action space (possible agent actions), and reward function.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., DQN) and implement the AI agent using the chosen library.
4. **Training and Evaluation:** Run the training loop, allowing the AI agent to interact with the game environment and learn. Regularly evaluate its performance and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
5. **Visualization and Reporting:** Visualize the training progress (e.g., plot the score over time) and present the final agent's performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that guides the AI towards desired behavior is crucial and can be challenging. Experimentation and iteration might be necessary.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the reinforcement learning algorithm can be time-consuming.  Prioritize a reasonable starting point and potentially utilize pre-trained models if time is limited.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with implementing and applying a reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Game AI Development:**  Understand how to integrate AI agents into simple games and utilize game environments for training.
