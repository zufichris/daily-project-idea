# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The game will be a custom-designed, deterministic environment, simplifying the RL implementation while still presenting a challenging learning problem. The goal is to demonstrate a functional RL agent within a short timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** OpenAI Gym or Stable Baselines3
* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Deterministic Game Environment:** A simple text-based game (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items) with clearly defined states, actions, and rewards.
- **RL Agent Implementation:**  A basic RL agent using Q-learning or a simpler algorithm.
- **Training and Evaluation:**  The agent should be trained on the game environment and its performance evaluated.
- **Visualization:**  Basic visualization of the agent's progress (e.g., plotting rewards over time).
- **Reward Function Design:** A well-defined reward function that guides the agent's learning.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., SARSA).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Incorporate a simple neural network for function approximation within the RL agent.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game rules, states, actions, and reward function.  Create a simple Python class to represent the game environment.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity) and implement the agent's logic.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively interacts with the environment, updates the agent's policy, and records performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the trained agent's performance on the game environment.
5. **Visualization:** Plot the rewards or other relevant metrics to visualize the agent's learning progress.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Creating an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Careful consideration is needed to ensure the agent learns the desired behavior.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the right hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the RL algorithm might require some experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces the core concepts of RL, including state-action spaces, reward functions, and policy updates.
- **Practical Application of RL Algorithms:**  Hands-on experience implementing and evaluating a simple RL algorithm in a concrete environment.
