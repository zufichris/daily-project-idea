# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimal 2D game using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and showcasing the core concepts of RL, not creating a polished game.  The significance lies in understanding and implementing a practical application of RL within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning)
- Tools:  A suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., navigating a maze to a goal, collecting items).
    - An AI agent that uses a Q-learning algorithm.
    - Visualization of the agent's actions and learning progress within the game.
    - Basic reward system to guide the agent's learning.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for a more complex game.
    - Incorporating an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for better learning.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Create a basic 2D game using Pygame.  Define the game state, actions, and reward structure.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent with a simple Q-table. Define the state space and action space.
3. **Training Loop:**  Develop a training loop that iteratively updates the Q-table based on the agent's actions and rewards.
4. **Visualization:** Integrate visualization to display the game and the agent's performance (e.g., score, steps taken).
5. **Testing:**  Test the agent's performance after training and analyze its learning curve.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Space Explosion:** If the game becomes too complex, the state space might grow exponentially, making the Q-table very large.  Consider using function approximation or a DQN to address this.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate can require experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforces understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (Q-learning, rewards, exploration/exploitation).
- Improves practical skills in implementing and applying reinforcement learning algorithms using Python and relevant libraries.
