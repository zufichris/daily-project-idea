# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent that learns to play a mini-game using reinforcement learning (RL).  The mini-game will be a custom-designed, text-based game, allowing for rapid iteration and prototyping. The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL within a constrained timeframe, showcasing core RL concepts and techniques.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 or similar
- **Game Engine (optional):** Pygame (for a visual representation, if time allows)
- **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Logic:** Implement a simple turn-based game with a clear reward system (e.g., points for achieving objectives, penalties for failures).
- **RL Agent:** Develop a basic RL agent using a suitable algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
- **Training and Evaluation:** Implement training loops for the agent and functions to evaluate its performance.
- **Data Logging:** Log relevant training data (rewards, actions, states) for analysis and visualization.
- **Simple Game Interface:**  A text-based interface to interact with the game and observe the agent's actions.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., A2C, SAC) if time permits.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Visualize the game and the agent's learning progress using Pygame.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Design:** Design a simple, well-defined turn-based game with a clear state space, action space, and reward function.  Keep it very minimalistic (e.g., a simple grid-based movement game).
2. **Environment Creation:** Create a Python environment representing the game's rules and logic.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm and implement the agent using Stable Baselines3 or a similar library.
4. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop to train the agent iteratively, using the environment and the chosen RL algorithm.
5. **Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluate the agent's performance by testing it against a simple baseline or visualizing its learning curve.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Shaping:** Defining an appropriate reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Careful consideration is needed to ensure the rewards encourage desired actions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm may require experimentation and iteration.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with core RL concepts such as state, action, reward, policy, and value functions.
- **Implementation of RL Algorithms:** Develop proficiency in implementing and applying RL algorithms using a popular library like Stable Baselines3.
