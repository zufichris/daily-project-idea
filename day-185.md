# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple self-balancing robotic arm controlled via a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The goal is to build a system that can maintain a specific angle despite external disturbances, demonstrating a fundamental control system concept within a manageable timeframe.  This project is significant because it showcases practical application of PID control, a cornerstone algorithm in robotics and automation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization and control input), NumPy (for numerical computations)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A small, inexpensive robotic arm (e.g., a modified servo-based kit) and microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) for physical implementation.  The project can be completed as a simulation without hardware.
* **Simulation Environment (if no hardware):** VPython or similar 3D physics engine for simulated robotic arm.


## Features & Requirements

- **Angle Control:**  The robotic arm should maintain a user-specified target angle.
- **PID Implementation:**  A PID controller should be implemented to regulate the arm's angle.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide real-time visual feedback of the arm's angle and control signals.
- **Disturbance Handling (simulation only if using physical hardware):**  The system (in simulation) should demonstrate its ability to recover from simulated disturbances (e.g., sudden applied force).
- **User Interface (optional):** A simple graphical user interface (GUI) allowing for the adjustment of PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a self-tuning PID algorithm to automatically adjust gains based on system performance.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add a "path planning" feature where the user can specify a sequence of target angles for the arm to follow smoothly.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Simulation/Hardware Configuration:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and configure the simulation environment or connect to the robotic arm hardware.
2. **Basic Robotic Arm Model:** Create a simplified model of the robotic arm (either in simulation or by understanding the hardware's kinematics).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID control algorithm, defining the proportional, integral, and derivative terms.
4. **Control Loop:** Create a main control loop that continuously reads the arm's current angle, calculates the error, applies the PID control output to the arm (simulation or hardware), and updates the visualization.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the system, adjusting the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal performanceâ€”minimizing oscillations and settling time.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Starting with simple values and gradually fine-tuning is recommended.
- **Real-time Constraints (Hardware):**  If using hardware, ensuring the control loop runs fast enough to maintain stability can be challenging. Using efficient code and optimized libraries is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID Control:** This project solidifies understanding of PID control theory and its implementation.
- **Practical Application of Control Systems:**  The project bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application of control systems in a robotic context.
