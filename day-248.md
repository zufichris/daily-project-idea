# Minimalist Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project aims to develop a fast and efficient inverse kinematics solver for a 3-DOF robotic arm.  The focus is on minimalism and speed, prioritizing a functional solution over complex optimization or graphical user interfaces.  This will be valuable for quick prototyping and testing of robotic arm control algorithms.  The solver will accept target Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) and return the corresponding joint angles.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy (for numerical computation), SciPy (optional, for optimization routines if time permits)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - Accepts target (x, y, z) coordinates as input.
    - Calculates the required joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) for a 3-DOF robotic arm with known link lengths.
    - Outputs the calculated joint angles.
    - Handles potential singularities (e.g., where a solution may not exist).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Incorporation of a simple visualization using Matplotlib to display the arm's configuration.
    - Implementation of an iterative solver (e.g., Newton-Raphson) for improved accuracy and handling of more complex arm geometries.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Robot Geometry:**  Establish the link lengths (l1, l2, l3) of the 3-DOF robotic arm.  Use simple geometric equations to model the arm's kinematics.
2. **Implement Inverse Kinematics:**  Develop the core algorithm to solve for joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) given the target (x, y, z) coordinates.  Prioritize a closed-form solution if possible; otherwise, use a numerical method (e.g., a simpler iterative approach).
3. **Error Handling and Singularity Detection:**  Add logic to handle cases where a solution doesn't exist (singularities) or where the target point is unreachable due to physical limitations of the arm.  Report an appropriate error message in such situations.
4. **Testing and Validation:**  Test the solver with various input coordinates, comparing the output joint angles to expected values (perhaps using a simple geometric visualization).
5. **Optional: Visualization:** If time permits, add a basic visualization using Matplotlib to graphically represent the robot arm's configuration based on the calculated joint angles.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Singularity Handling:**  Dealing with configurations where the arm is unable to reach the target position requires robust error handling and potentially a fallback mechanism.
- **Accuracy vs. Speed:**  Balancing the need for accurate solutions with the speed constraint of a daily challenge might require selecting a computationally efficient solving method.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of robotic arm kinematics and the difference between forward and inverse kinematics.
- Practical experience in implementing and testing mathematical algorithms in a programming environment.
