# AI-Powered Real-time Object Tracking and Classification for a Robot Arm

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a system that allows a robotic arm to track and classify objects in real-time using computer vision and machine learning. The significance lies in creating a foundation for more advanced robotic manipulation tasks such as picking, placing, and sorting objects.  This daily challenge will focus on a simplified version, concentrating on tracking a single, known object.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), NumPy
* **Hardware:**  A robotic arm (physical or simulated using a robotics simulator like PyBullet or Gazebo), a camera (physical or simulated).


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect and locate a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:** Continuously track the object's position as it moves.
- **Arm Control:**  Simple commands to move the robotic arm based on the object's tracked position.
- **Classification (Optional):**  Distinguish between multiple pre-defined objects.
- **Data Visualization:** Display the tracked object and its coordinates on the camera feed.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Set up the camera and robotic arm (physical or simulated). Capture a dataset of images containing the target object.
2. **Object Detection Model Training (if needed):** Train a simple object detection model (e.g., using a pre-trained model like YOLOv5 or a simpler approach for single object tracking) if not using a pre-trained model.
3. **Real-time Object Tracking:** Implement the object tracking algorithm using OpenCV's tracking functions or your trained model.
4. **Robotic Arm Control:** Integrate the object's tracked coordinates to control the robotic arm, directing it towards the object.  This may involve inverse kinematics if using a physical arm.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system and refine the parameters to achieve optimal tracking and arm control accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Efficiency:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms and potentially hardware acceleration. Consider using optimized libraries and reducing image resolution if necessary.
- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Dealing with lighting changes, occlusions, and object movement variations can impact tracking accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of computer vision techniques for object detection and tracking.
- Practical experience with integrating computer vision and robotics using Python.
