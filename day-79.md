# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves developing a simple AI agent using reinforcement learning (RL) to play a miniature game like Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Connect Four.  The goal is to demonstrate a functional RL agent within a short timeframe, focusing on core RL concepts rather than complex game strategies.  This project is significant as it provides a hands-on experience with a fundamental AI technique and can be extended for more complex games later.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or simplified Connect Four).
    - A RL agent using Q-learning or a simpler RL algorithm.
    - Training the agent against a random opponent.
    - Evaluation of the agent's performance (win rate against random opponent).
    - Basic visualization of the game state and agent's actions.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Training the agent against itself (self-play).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple game environment using Python.  This can be text-based or use a simple graphical library like Pygame for visualization.  Define state representation, actions, and reward functions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent. This involves defining the Q-table, updating Q-values based on the Bellman equation, and selecting actions using an epsilon-greedy strategy.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop to repeatedly play the game, update the Q-table, and track the agent's performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent against a random opponent and measure its win rate.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  Enhance the game environment with basic visualization to see the game progress and the agent's actions.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **State Space:**  Managing the state space complexity, especially if using a slightly more complex game than Tic-Tac-Toe.  Consider using feature engineering to reduce the dimensionality if necessary.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding appropriate learning rates, exploration rates, and other hyperparameters can impact the agent's learning speed and performance.  Experimentation is key.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning principles (Q-learning, Bellman equation, exploration-exploitation).
- Building and training a simple AI agent.
- Understanding the role of environment design in RL.
