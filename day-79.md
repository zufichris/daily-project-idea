# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a miniature self-balancing robot arm using a simple servo motor and a microcontroller.  The arm will be designed to maintain a stable upright position despite external disturbances. This project showcases fundamental control systems concepts within a practical robotics application, suitable for a 1-2 day challenge.  The focus will be on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for precise balance.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 for advanced features).
- **Servo Motor:**  A standard servo motor with sufficient torque.
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** MPU6050 or similar (provides acceleration and gyroscope data).
- **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
- **Libraries:**  MPU6050 library for IMU data acquisition, Servo library for servo motor control.
- **CAD Software (Optional):** Fusion 360 or Tinkercad for designing a 3D-printed arm structure.


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The robot arm should maintain a stable upright position.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to regulate the arm's balance.
- **IMU Data Integration:**  The system should accurately read and utilize data from the IMU.
- **Servo Motor Control:** Precise control of the servo motor's angle based on IMU feedback.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Visual feedback (LED or Serial Monitor) indicating the arm's angle and control adjustments.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of a setpoint (desired angle) for controlled movements, adding a load to the arm to test robustness.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU and servo motor to the microcontroller.  If using a 3D-printed structure, assemble it.
2. **IMU Calibration and Data Acquisition:** Calibrate the IMU and verify accurate data reading through the Serial Monitor.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a basic PID controller algorithm in the Arduino code, initially with default gain values.
4. **Tuning the PID Controller:**  Tune the P, I, and D gains iteratively to achieve optimal stability and responsiveness. This involves observing the system's behavior and adjusting the gains accordingly.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system's stability under various conditions (gentle pushes, etc.), and refine the PID gains for improved performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gain values can be challenging and requires iterative experimentation and understanding of the system's dynamics.
- **IMU Noise:**  IMU readings can be noisy, which can affect the accuracy of the control system. Implementing filtering techniques (e.g., a complementary filter) can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:**  Gain practical experience implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems engineering.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Strengthen skills in embedded systems programming using C++ and interacting with sensors and actuators in real-time.
