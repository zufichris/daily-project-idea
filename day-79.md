# Self-Healing Robotic Arm Trajectory Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic simulation and control system for a robotic arm that can autonomously adjust its trajectory to avoid unexpected obstacles. The significance lies in demonstrating a simplified version of self-healing capabilities crucial for robust robotic systems operating in dynamic environments.  This project will focus on a 2D planar arm for simplicity.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pygame (for visualization)
* **Robotics Simulation:**  PyBullet (or a simpler 2D physics engine if PyBullet proves too complex for a 2-day timeframe)

## Features & Requirements

- **Kinematic Modeling:**  A 2-link robotic arm model with forward and inverse kinematics.
- **Trajectory Planning:**  Generation of a simple linear trajectory between two points.
- **Obstacle Detection:**  Basic obstacle detection using a simple distance-based method (e.g., checking for proximity to predefined obstacles).
- **Trajectory Adjustment:**  Modification of the planned trajectory to avoid detected obstacles using a simple path replanning algorithm (e.g., a basic A* search or a potential field method).
- **Visualization:**  Real-time visualization of the arm's movement and obstacles using Pygame.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporation of a more sophisticated obstacle avoidance algorithm (e.g., RRT*).  Adding a simple dynamic obstacle (moving object).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Kinematic Modeling & Trajectory Planning:** Implement forward and inverse kinematics for the 2-link arm.  Generate a basic linear trajectory between two user-specified points.
2. **Obstacle Representation & Detection:** Define obstacle positions and implement a distance-based obstacle detection mechanism.
3. **Trajectory Adjustment:**  If an obstacle is detected, implement a simple path replanning algorithm (e.g., adjust the trajectory to go around the obstacle).  Consider a basic collision avoidance algorithm (e.g., potential fields).
4. **Simulation & Visualization:** Integrate the arm model, obstacle detection, and trajectory adjustment into a simulation environment using Pygame for visualization.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system with various obstacle configurations and refine the parameters of the path planning algorithm.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:**  More sophisticated path planning algorithms can be computationally expensive, requiring careful consideration of the time constraints.  A simplified approach might be necessary to meet the 2-day deadline.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate path planning algorithm that balances complexity and effectiveness within the time frame. Prioritizing a simple algorithm that works well for this simplified 2D problem is important.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Kinematics and Dynamics:**  This project provides hands-on experience with robotic arm kinematics, trajectory planning, and basic dynamics.
- **Practical Application of Path Planning Algorithms:**  The implementation of obstacle avoidance strengthens understanding of path planning concepts and their application in real-world scenarios.
