# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Connect Four, using reinforcement learning. The focus is on creating a functional prototype within a short timeframe, showcasing the core concepts of RL without excessive complexity.  The significance lies in demonstrating the power of RL in a concise and understandable manner.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, if not building a custom one), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL algorithm implementation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or simplified Connect Four) with clear win/loss/draw conditions.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  An agent using a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA) to learn optimal game strategies.
- **Training Loop:**  A training loop that allows the agent to play multiple games against itself, updating its policy based on rewards.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics to track the agent's learning progress (e.g., win rate over time).
- **Visualization (Optional):**  A simple visualization of the game state and agent's actions.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Explore different RL algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN for more complex games) or implement a human vs. AI mode.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game rules and create the environment (using OpenAI Gym or a custom implementation).  This includes defining the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point) and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on its learned policy.
3. **Training Loop Development:** Create a training loop that iteratively allows the agent to play the game, receive rewards, and update its policy.
4. **Evaluation and Tuning:**  Run the training loop and monitor the agent's performance. Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) to optimize learning.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** Implement a basic visualization to observe the game and the agent's decision-making process.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm can be challenging and may require experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust incrementally.
- **Reward Function Design:** A well-designed reward function is crucial for effective learning.  Consider different reward structures to encourage optimal behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience in implementing and applying basic RL concepts.
- **Agent-Environment Interaction:** Understand the fundamental interaction between an AI agent and its environment in the context of RL.
