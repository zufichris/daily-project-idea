# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a lamp, fan, or smart plug) using a combination of voice commands and hand gestures.  The focus will be on creating a responsive and intuitive user interface leveraging readily available technologies. This demonstrates a practical application of integrating multiple input modalities for streamlined control, a growing trend in smart home technology.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyAudio (for audio input), OpenCV (for computer vision), SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text), a suitable library for controlling your chosen smart appliance (e.g., Home Assistant API, specific manufacturer's API).
* **Hardware:** A microphone, a webcam, and the target smart home appliance.  A Raspberry Pi or similar device is optional for a more portable solution.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:** The system should respond to basic voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Increase brightness."
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should recognize simple gestures like a waving hand for "on" and a clenched fist for "off".  (Specific gestures can be adjusted for feasibility).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Visual or audio feedback should be provided to the user confirming the action taken.
- **Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle invalid voice commands and gesture recognition failures.
- **Appliance Integration:**  Successful connection and control of a chosen smart home appliance.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Add support for multiple appliances, allowing users to specify which appliance to control in their voice commands.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a simple GUI for visualization and configuration of the system.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the microphone and webcam.
2. **Voice recognition:** Implement voice command recognition using SpeechRecognition.  Focus on a small set of core commands.
3. **Gesture recognition:** Use OpenCV to capture and process images from the webcam, implementing a basic gesture recognition algorithm (e.g., using simple image processing techniques).
4. **Appliance Control:** Integrate the control logic, sending commands to the chosen appliance based on voice and gesture inputs.
5. **Feedback Mechanism:** Display feedback (e.g., on-screen text or LED indicator) upon successful command execution.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  The accuracy of gesture recognition can be affected by lighting conditions, background clutter, and hand variations. Experiment with different image processing techniques to achieve acceptable accuracy within the time constraint.
- **API Integration:**  Successfully connecting to and controlling the chosen smart applianceâ€™s API requires understanding its documentation and potentially some debugging.  Consider using a readily available, well-documented API if possible.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Input Processing:**  This project reinforces understanding of integrating multiple input sources (audio and video) for more robust and natural user interfaces.
- **Real-time System Development:** Building a system that responds dynamically to user inputs enhances skills in real-time processing and event handling.
