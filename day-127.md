# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic light system incorporating basic AI for optimizing traffic flow.  The simulation will focus on a single intersection with multiple lanes, demonstrating the potential for improving efficiency through dynamic adjustments based on simulated vehicle density.  This is a valuable exercise in applying basic AI concepts to a real-world problem in a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computations), a simple queue data structure (e.g., `collections.deque`).


## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Generation:** Simulate vehicles appearing randomly at different entry points with varying speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light cycle (red, yellow, green) for each direction.
- **Vehicle Movement:**  Simulate vehicles moving through the intersection according to traffic light signals and avoiding collisions.
- **Density Sensing:**  Implement a mechanism to detect vehicle density in each lane approaching the intersection.
- **Basic Optimization:** Adjust the traffic light timings based on detected density; give priority to lanes with higher density.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated AI algorithm (e.g., a simple Q-learning approach) for traffic light control.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Add visualization of vehicle queues and waiting times.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Basic Structure:** Create the Pygame window, define the intersection layout (lanes, traffic lights), and initialize vehicle properties (position, speed, etc.).
2. **Traffic Generation and Movement:** Implement functions to generate vehicles randomly and update their positions based on speed and traffic light states.  Handle collision detection (simple bounding box collision sufficient).
3. **Density Sensing:** Calculate the number of vehicles in each lane within a defined proximity to the intersection.
4. **Basic Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple rule-based system to adjust traffic light timings based on density.  Higher density gets priority.
5. **Visualization:** Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light states using Pygame.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Collision Detection:** Ensuring accurate and efficient collision detection to prevent vehicles from overlapping. A simple bounding box approach will be sufficient for this simplified simulation.
- **Balancing Optimization and Simplicity:**  The AI for traffic light control needs to be simple enough to implement within the time constraints, while still demonstrating the core concept of optimization.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce object-oriented programming:**  Designing classes for vehicles, traffic lights, and the intersection itself.
- **Practical application of AI concepts:**  Implement a basic AI algorithm to solve a real-world problem, even with limitations.
