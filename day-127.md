# Self-Calibrating Robotic Gripper Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple control system for a robotic gripper that can self-calibrate its grip force based on the perceived weight and shape of an object. This is a miniaturized version of advanced adaptive gripping systems found in industrial robotics, focusing on achieving a functional prototype within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating a key aspect of autonomous robotics: adapting to unforeseen circumstances.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, OpenCV (for image processing - optional, can be simplified), PySerial (for serial communication with microcontroller/robotic arm)
* **Hardware:** A small robotic arm with a gripper (e.g., a hobbyist kit like those from Elegoo or Dobot), a load cell (force sensor), a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino).


## Features & Requirements

- **Grip Force Sensing:** Accurately measure the grip force using the load cell.
- **Object Weight Estimation:**  Estimate the weight of the grasped object based on the load cell readings. (Simplification: assume a uniform density for a first iteration).
- **Adaptive Grip Control:** Adjust the grip force based on the estimated weight, preventing slippage or crushing.
- **Basic Gripping Routine:** Implement a sequence for picking up and placing down an object.
- **Safety Mechanism:**  Implement a maximum grip force limit to prevent damage.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Object Shape Recognition using OpenCV for more sophisticated grip adjustment (requires significant time).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of a PID controller for more precise force regulation.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup & Calibration:** Connect the load cell to the microcontroller, calibrate the load cell's analog-to-digital converter readings against known weights.  Connect the microcontroller to the robotic arm and PC.
2. **Data Acquisition:** Write a Python script to read the load cell data from the microcontroller via serial communication.  Visualize this data to ensure accuracy.
3. **Weight Estimation & Control Logic:** Develop a simple algorithm to estimate weight based on the load cell readings and implement a basic proportional control algorithm to adjust the gripper force.
4. **Gripping Routine Implementation:**  Integrate the control algorithm into a sequence for picking up and placing an object.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various objects of different weights. Refine the control algorithm based on the results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Load Cell Calibration:** Ensuring accurate and reliable calibration of the load cell is crucial for accurate weight estimation.
- **Control Algorithm Tuning:** Finding optimal control parameters for the proportional controller to avoid overshooting or undershooting the desired grip force might require iteration.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Integration:** Gain practical experience in interfacing a microcontroller with a PC for data acquisition and control.
- **Control Systems Fundamentals:** Apply basic control principles (proportional control) to a real-world robotic system.
