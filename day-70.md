# Real-time Object Recognition and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object recognition and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and a pre-trained object detection model.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in a video stream from the camera and track its movement, displaying the object's location on the video feed in real-time.  This demonstrates practical applications in robotics, surveillance, or automated systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (model 4 recommended), USB camera, monitor.
* **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for pre-trained model), potentially a lightweight GUI framework (like Tkinter).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time object detection:** Identify the target object (pre-defined) in each frame of the video stream.
- **Object tracking:** Maintain tracking of the object's position across frames, even if partially occluded.
- **Visual feedback:** Display bounding boxes and potentially object ID on the video feed, highlighting the tracked object.
- **Performance measurement:** Calculate and display frames per second (FPS) to assess system performance.
- **Data logging (optional):** Record object coordinates and timestamps for later analysis.

**Advanced Features:**

- **Multiple object tracking:** Track multiple instances of the target object simultaneously.
- **Distance estimation:** Estimate the distance to the tracked object using camera calibration.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch) on the Raspberry Pi. Download a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNet SSD) optimized for speed and resource efficiency.
2. **Camera calibration (optional):** If distance estimation is desired, perform camera calibration to obtain intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
3. **Object detection integration:** Integrate the chosen object detection model with OpenCV to process the camera feed in real-time.
4. **Tracking implementation:** Implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, DeepSORT) to track the detected object across frames.
5. **GUI and visualization:** Develop a simple GUI to display the video feed with bounding boxes and tracking information.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational constraints:** Balancing detection accuracy and speed on the Raspberry Pi's limited processing power may require careful model selection and optimization techniques.
- **Object occlusion:** Robust tracking in the presence of partial or full object occlusion can be challenging.  Consider implementing occlusion handling techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:** Gain practical experience in utilizing OpenCV for real-time video processing and object detection.
- **Object tracking algorithms:** Learn to implement and evaluate different object tracking algorithms for performance and robustness.
