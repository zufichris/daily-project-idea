# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and implementing a basic Q-learning algorithm to demonstrate the core concepts of RL within a constrained timeframe.  The significance lies in showcasing a powerful AI technique in a readily understandable and implementable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pygame (for visualization, optional)
- Reinforcement Learning Library:  Consider a minimal implementation of Q-learning directly in Python for brevity;  a lightweight RL library could be used if time allows.

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - A Q-learning agent that learns to play the game optimally against a random player.
    - Ability to train the agent for a defined number of episodes.
    - Display of the agent's win rate against the random player.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Visualization of the game state and agent's decision-making process (using Pygame).
    -  Implementation of an ε-greedy exploration strategy to enhance learning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:**  Define the game board, rules, and functions to determine game states (win, loss, draw).
2. **Q-Learning Agent Implementation:**  Create the Q-table and implement the Q-learning update rule.  Choose a suitable reward system (e.g., +1 for win, -1 for loss, 0 for draw).
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a loop to repeatedly play games, update the Q-table based on the agent's experience, and track the win rate.
4. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance by playing multiple games against a random player or another simple strategy.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** Integrate Pygame (or a similar library) to visually display the game and the agent's actions during training and evaluation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**  Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions is crucial for efficient learning.  This may require tuning the learning rate and ε-greedy parameters.
- **State Representation:** Choosing a suitable representation for the game state is important for the effectiveness of the Q-learning algorithm.  A simple numerical representation will suffice for Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement Learning fundamentals: Understanding the core concepts of Q-learning, including state, action, reward, and the update rule.
- Agent-based programming:  Developing and training an autonomous agent to solve a problem.
