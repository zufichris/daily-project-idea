# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple system for real-time object detection and tracking using a camera and a robotic arm (simulated or physical). The goal is to enable the robotic arm to locate and potentially grasp a specific object within its workspace. This is a valuable exercise in integrating computer vision with robotics, applicable to various automation tasks.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for pre-trained model), Robot Operating System (ROS) or a robotics simulation environment (e.g., Gazebo, PyBullet) if using a physical robot.
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR), a USB camera.

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  The system should accurately detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball, a specific shaped block) in the camera's field of view using a pre-trained object detection model (YOLOv5, SSD, etc.).
- **Object Tracking:**  Once detected, the system should track the object's movement in real-time, providing continuous updates on its location (x, y coordinates).
- **Robotic Arm Control (Basic):**  The system should send commands to the robotic arm (simulated or real) to move its end-effector towards the detected object's location.  This could be a simple movement to a calculated coordinate.
- **Distance Estimation (Optional):**  Estimate the distance to the object using camera calibration and depth information (if available).
- **Error Handling:**  Implement basic error handling for cases where the object is not detected or tracking is lost.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Set up the development environment, install necessary libraries, and load a pre-trained object detection model. If using a real robot, establish communication with it.  If simulating, set up the simulation environment and robot model.
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:**  Implement the object detection and tracking pipeline using OpenCV.  Use the pre-trained model to detect the object and track its centroid.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Convert the object's pixel coordinates from the camera image to the robot's coordinate system. This might require camera calibration and a transformation matrix.
4. **Robotic Arm Control:** Send control commands to the robotic arm (or simulation) to move towards the detected object's location in the robot's coordinate system.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system and refine the parameters (e.g., movement speed, tracking sensitivity) to achieve optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Coordinate Transformation:** Accurate transformation between camera and robot coordinates can be challenging, requiring careful calibration and potentially complex transformations.  Approximations might be sufficient for a daily challenge.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Ensuring real-time performance requires efficient code and possibly optimization techniques to handle the processing demands of object detection, tracking, and robotic arm control.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Integration of Computer Vision and Robotics:** This project provides hands-on experience integrating computer vision algorithms with robotic control systems.
- **Real-time System Development:**  The project emphasizes the challenges and techniques involved in building and optimizing real-time systems.
