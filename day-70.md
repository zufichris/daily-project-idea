# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple, yet challenging, 2D game and implementing a rudimentary AI opponent using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus is on rapid prototyping using a readily available RL library and a concise game environment. This demonstrates practical RL application and provides a hands-on experience with AI development within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Game Framework: Pygame (or similar lightweight 2D framework)
- Reinforcement Learning Library: Stable Baselines3 (or similar)
- IDE: VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Game Mechanics:** A simple game like Pong or a basic maze navigation.  The game should have clear win/lose conditions.
- **AI Opponent:** An AI agent using a RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C) to learn optimal strategies.
- **Training Loop:**  A straightforward training loop that allows the AI to learn through iterative gameplay against itself or a simple rule-based opponent.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the game and the AI's learning progress (e.g., reward curves).
- **Basic Game State Representation:**  Representing the game state in a numerical format suitable for the RL algorithm.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Saving and loading trained AI models. Implementing a more complex game environment (e.g., more obstacles in the maze or more players in Pong).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Hyperparameter tuning to optimize AI performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pygame, Stable Baselines3). Design and implement the core game mechanics using Pygame. Define the game state representation.
2. **Define the RL agent:** Choose an appropriate RL algorithm from Stable Baselines3 (e.g., PPO).  Configure the agent's hyperparameters (learning rate, etc.).
3. **Implement the training loop:**  Write a loop that iteratively plays the game, collects data, and updates the agent's policy.  Include mechanisms to track and visualize performance.
4. **Train the AI:** Run the training loop for a predetermined number of steps or until satisfactory performance is achieved.
5. **Test and Evaluate:** Play against the trained AI to evaluate its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Representation:** Choosing an effective and concise way to represent the game state is crucial for the RL algorithm's learning efficiency.  A poorly chosen representation can hinder learning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require some experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning techniques in a real-world (albeit simplified) scenario.
- Experience with RL libraries and their integration with game development frameworks.
- Understanding of the challenges and considerations involved in training and evaluating RL agents.
