# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, wave) and map them to specific smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume). This provides a hands-free, intuitive alternative to traditional voice or app-based control.  The focus will be on efficient implementation and achieving a functional prototype within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation),  a suitable smart home API library (e.g., Home Assistant API)
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a suitable development environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  The system should accurately detect predefined hand gestures from the webcam feed in real-time.
- **Gesture-Action Mapping:**  A configurable mapping between detected gestures and specific smart home actions.
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Basic integration with at least one smart home device (e.g., a smart light bulb).
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple UI (e.g., a console display) to show detected gestures and their corresponding actions.

- **Advanced Features:**  Gesture-based volume control (subtle hand movements control volume level),  multiple user support.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS) for more scalable data processing.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries and set up the webcam feed using OpenCV. Capture a small dataset of training images for each gesture (thumbs up, thumbs down, wave etc.)
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Use MediaPipe's pose estimation model to extract relevant hand features from the webcam feed.  Develop a simple gesture classification logic (e.g., comparing hand landmark coordinates to predefined thresholds).
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Implement the logic to send commands to the smart home device based on the recognized gesture. This might involve API calls or using a local network interface.
4. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI (console output is sufficient) to display the recognized gesture and the corresponding smart home action.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and user variations. Refine gesture recognition thresholds as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Performance:**  Ensuring smooth and low-latency gesture detection and action execution can be challenging. Optimization of code and algorithms might be needed.
- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Handling variations in hand positions, lighting conditions, and background clutter to maintain accuracy will require careful consideration of the recognition model.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of computer vision techniques (specifically, real-time image processing and gesture recognition).
- Practical experience in integrating different software components (computer vision, smart home control) to build a functional system.
