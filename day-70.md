# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.  The goal is to develop a functional AI that can learn and improve its gameplay strategy within a short timeframe, demonstrating core RL concepts in a practical context. This project is significant as it allows for a quick exploration of RL principles without the complexity of larger-scale projects.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), Gym (optional, for simplified RL environment creation), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for RL algorithm implementation â€“ either one is sufficient).  A simpler approach without Gym is encouraged given the time constraint.


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Mechanics:** A simple 2D game (e.g., Pong, a simplified version of Snake, or a custom design) with clear win/lose conditions.
- **AI Opponent:** An AI controlled by a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
- **Learning and Adaptation:** The AI should demonstrate improved performance over multiple game iterations.
- **Game Visualization:**  The game should have a clear visual representation using Pygame.
- **Performance Metrics:** Basic metrics to track the AI's learning progress (e.g., win rate).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)) if time permits.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Add a training visualization to display the AI's Q-values or policy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Design and Implementation:** Design and implement the core game mechanics using Pygame.  Keep it extremely simple.
2. **AI Environment Setup:** Define the game state, actions, and rewards for the RL agent.  A reward function should be designed to reflect the AI's progress.
3. **RL Algorithm Implementation:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement it.  Focus on a concise implementation to stay within the time constraint.
4. **Training and Evaluation:** Train the AI agent for a set number of iterations or until a satisfactory performance level is reached.  Evaluate the AI's performance using the defined metrics.
5. **Integration and Refinement:** Integrate the trained AI into the game, and refine the game logic or AI parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the AI towards optimal gameplay can be challenging.  Experimentation may be necessary.
- **Computational Cost:**  Depending on the complexity of the game and RL algorithm, the training process could be computationally intensive. Consider simplifying the game or using a less computationally demanding RL algorithm if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces the core concepts of reinforcement learning, including states, actions, rewards, and learning algorithms.
- **Game Development with Pygame:** This project provides hands-on experience with game development using Pygame, including game loop management and visual representation.
