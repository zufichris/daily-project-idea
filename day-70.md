# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Robot

## Overview

This project aims to develop and implement an optimized pathfinding algorithm for a simulated robot navigating a 2D environment with obstacles. The focus will be on comparing the performance of different algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra's) and potentially incorporating heuristics for improved efficiency.  The significance lies in understanding the trade-offs between algorithm complexity and path quality in real-world robotics applications.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pygame` (for visualization), `networkx` (optional, for graph representation), `matplotlib` (optional, for performance visualization)

## Features & Requirements

- **Environment Representation:**  A 2D grid-based environment with randomly generated obstacles.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implementation of at least one pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*).
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the robot's movement and the calculated path using `pygame`.
- **Performance Measurement:**  Tracking and displaying the computation time for pathfinding.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot should successfully navigate around obstacles.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implementing a second pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's) for comparison.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporating a heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan distance) to improve A* performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a 2D grid environment using `pygame` and randomly generate obstacles.
2. **Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the chosen pathfinding algorithm (A* initially).
3. **Path Visualization:** Visualize the robot's path and the environment using `pygame`.
4. **Performance Testing:** Measure and display the computation time for pathfinding.
5. **Algorithm Comparison (Optional):** Implement a second algorithm and compare performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Balancing the complexity of the algorithm with the need for real-time performance. This might require optimizing the implementation or adjusting the environment size.
- **Heuristic Function Selection:** Choosing an appropriate heuristic function for A* can significantly impact performance.  Experimentation might be needed.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of pathfinding algorithms:**  This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and comparing different pathfinding algorithms.
- **Understanding algorithm efficiency:**  By measuring and comparing performance, the project highlights the importance of algorithm choice in real-time applications.
