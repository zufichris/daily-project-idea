# Mini-Max Search for a Simplified Game AI

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Mini-Max search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for a simplified version of a two-player game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four. The goal is to create a functional AI opponent that makes reasonably optimal moves within a constrained timeframe, showcasing a core AI technique.  The simplified game rules allow focusing on the algorithm implementation rather than game-specific complexities.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (for its readability and readily available libraries)
- **Libraries:** NumPy (optional, for efficient array handling if the game board is large)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Board Representation:**  A data structure (e.g., list of lists, NumPy array) representing the game board.
- **Mini-Max Algorithm Implementation:** A recursive function implementing the Mini-Max search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- **Move Evaluation Function:** A heuristic function to evaluate the "goodness" of a board state from a player's perspective.  This function should be simple for this challenge (e.g., counting winning lines).
- **AI Player Turn:** The AI should make a move based on the Mini-Max search.
- **Human Player Input:**  Allow a human player to interact with the game (command line input is sufficient).

- **Optional:  GUI:** A simple graphical user interface (using Pygame or similar) to enhance the user experience.
- **Optional: Difficulty Levels:** Allow adjusting the search depth of the Mini-Max algorithm to control AI difficulty.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Define the game rules, board size, and winning conditions. Create the data structure for representing the game board.
2. **Mini-Max Function:** Implement the recursive Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The base cases should be when a player wins or the board is full.
3. **Evaluation Function:** Design a simple heuristic function that evaluates board states.
4. **Game Loop:** Create a loop that alternates between the human player's move and the AI's move, checking for win conditions after each turn.
5. **Input/Output:** Implement input mechanisms for the human player and output mechanisms to display the game state.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:**  The Mini-Max algorithm can be computationally expensive for larger games or deeper search depths.  Strategies like iterative deepening could be explored if time permits, but are not required.
- **Heuristic Function Design:** Creating an effective heuristic function is crucial for AI performance.  A poorly designed heuristic might lead to suboptimal moves.  Start with a simple heuristic and iterate if time allows.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of algorithm design and implementation:** This project solidifies understanding of recursive algorithms and search strategies.
- **Practical application of AI concepts:** Hands-on experience with a core AI algorithm, highlighting its strengths and limitations in a game environment.
