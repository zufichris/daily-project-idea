# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified intelligent traffic light system using agent-based modelling.  The goal is to create a basic simulation that dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on the density of vehicles at each intersection. This allows exploration of traffic flow optimization algorithms within a controlled environment.  This project's significance lies in its ability to serve as a foundation for more complex traffic management simulations.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `pygame` (for visualization), `numpy` (for numerical computation), potentially `matplotlib` (for data plotting).

## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Randomly generate vehicles at specified entry points with varying speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., fixed-time or a basic adaptive algorithm) to control traffic light timings.
- **Vehicle Movement:** Simulate vehicle movement through the intersection, respecting traffic signals and avoiding collisions.
- **Density Detection:** Calculate vehicle density at each approach to the intersection.
- **Visualization:** Display the simulation graphically using `pygame`, showing vehicle movement and traffic light states.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated adaptive traffic control algorithm (e.g., using reinforcement learning principles for a simplified scenario).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Introduce different vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses) with varying speeds and sizes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Initialization:** Create the simulation environment using `pygame`, define intersection geometry, and set initial parameters (vehicle generation rates, etc.).
2. **Vehicle Generation & Movement:** Implement vehicle generation and movement logic, handling collisions and adherence to traffic signals.
3. **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic fixed-time traffic light control algorithm.
4. **Density Calculation & Adaptation (Optional):**  Calculate vehicle density and (if implementing an advanced feature) adapt traffic light timings based on density.
5. **Visualization & Output:** Use `pygame` to visually represent the simulation, showing vehicles, traffic lights, and possibly relevant statistics (e.g., average waiting time).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Collision Detection:**  Efficiently detecting and handling vehicle collisions can be computationally expensive, especially with a large number of vehicles.  Simple bounding box collision detection is sufficient for a daily challenge.
- **Algorithm Design:** Choosing and implementing an effective traffic light control algorithm requires careful consideration of various factors (e.g., fairness, throughput). A simple algorithm is recommended for the daily challenge.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Agent-Based Modeling:**  This project reinforces understanding and application of agent-based modeling principles for simulating dynamic systems.
- **Algorithm Design & Implementation:**  The project allows practical experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating different traffic control algorithms.
