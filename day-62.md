# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimal game environment using reinforcement learning.  The game will be a basic grid-based navigation puzzle, where the agent needs to navigate to a target location, avoiding obstacles.  This project provides a hands-on experience with reinforcement learning algorithms in a manageable timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras)
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple grid-based game environment with a starting point, target, and obstacles.
    - An AI agent that uses a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler approach).
    - The agent should learn to navigate to the target while avoiding obstacles.
    - The training process should be observable (e.g., displaying the agent's actions and rewards).
    - Basic visualization of the game environment and agent's path.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    - Incorporating different types of obstacles with varying penalties.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple grid-based environment using Python and a library like Gym or create a custom environment.  Define rewards (positive for reaching the target, negative for hitting obstacles).
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (start with Q-learning for simplicity). Implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on the current state and learned Q-values.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively runs the agent in the environment, updating the Q-values based on the rewards received.
4. **Visualization:** Implement basic visualization to show the agent's progress, path, and the game environment.
5. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance by letting it play the game without training and observing its success rate.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**  Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting already known good actions is crucial for effective learning.  Experimenting with different exploration strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy) is key.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate are crucial hyperparameters that significantly affect the learning process.  Finding optimal values may require experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- Gain practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementation.
- Understand the concepts of state, action, reward, and the agent-environment interaction loop in reinforcement learning.
