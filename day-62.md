# Self-Healing Robotic Arm Joint Calibration

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified self-calibration routine for a robotic arm joint, using sensor data to automatically compensate for minor positional inaccuracies. This is crucial for ensuring consistent and reliable performance in robotic applications, particularly in situations where precise positioning is critical but regular manual calibration is impractical.  The goal is to create a prototype that can detect and correct small deviations in joint angle within a specified tolerance.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for numerical computation and optimization), potentially a robotics simulation library (e.g., PyBullet or V-REP) if not using a physical robot arm.
* **Hardware (Optional):** A small, single-joint robotic arm with an encoder or other position sensor.  A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) may be needed to interface with the sensor.
* **Tools:** A suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code or PyCharm.


## Features & Requirements

- **Sensor Data Acquisition:**  Read position data from the joint's sensor.
- **Deviation Detection:** Compare the actual joint angle to a target angle (set by user or program).
- **Error Correction Algorithm:** Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., proportional control) to adjust the joint angle to minimize the detected deviation.
- **Calibration Routine:** A function to automatically run the error detection and correction process.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Store the raw sensor data and calibrated values for analysis.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (PID control) for improved accuracy and stability.
- **Optional Feature:** Add a visualization component to display the sensor data, error, and correction process in real-time.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Sensor Integration & Data Acquisition:**  Interface with the sensor (physical or simulated) and acquire the joint angle readings. This involves appropriate driver setup and data parsing.
2. **Deviation Detection & Calculation:** Compare the sensor readings to a known target angle, calculating the error or deviation.
3. **Implement Error Correction Algorithm:**  Implement a basic proportional control algorithm to adjust the joint's position based on the calculated error.  Simpler algorithms are suitable for a short-term project.
4. **Calibration Routine:** Combine steps 2 and 3 into a function that automatically runs the calibration process.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the calibration routine with various target angles and initial deviations, refining the algorithm parameters to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:** Sensor readings might be noisy. Implement appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) to improve data quality.
- **Actuator Limitations:** The robot arm's actuator may have limitations in its range of motion or speed.  The control algorithm should account for these constraints to prevent errors.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Control Systems Concepts:** This project will solidify understanding of basic control algorithms (proportional control, potentially PID control).
- **Practical Application of Sensor Data Processing:** Experience in acquiring, processing, and interpreting sensor data for real-time control applications.
