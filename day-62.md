# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a micro-gesture recognition system based on a single depth camera.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures performed in front of the camera and trigger predefined smart home actions. This offers a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional voice assistants or app-based control. The focus is on rapid prototyping, achievable within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), NumPy (for numerical computation).
* **Hardware:** A depth camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect)
* **Optional:** A smart home hub (e.g., Raspberry Pi) and appropriate API access.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open hand, fist, thumbs up) with high accuracy.
- **Action Triggering:**  Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., turn on/off lights, adjust volume).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the camera feed and trigger actions with minimal latency.
- **User Calibration:** Allow for easy calibration to accommodate different hand sizes and lighting conditions.
- **Data Logging (optional):**  Record gesture data for analysis and model improvement.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Contextual Awareness:**  Consider the time of day or room location to personalize actions.
- **Multiple User Support:**  Distinguish between different users based on hand size/shape.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Calibration:** Install necessary libraries, connect the depth camera, and write a basic script to capture and display the depth image stream.  Calibrate the system to optimize hand detection based on the environment lighting.

2. **Hand Tracking:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect and track hands in real-time. Extract relevant features (e.g., landmark coordinates) from the tracked hand.

3. **Gesture Classification:** Develop a simple classifier (e.g., using a k-Nearest Neighbors or Support Vector Machine algorithm) to distinguish between the predefined gestures based on extracted features.

4. **Action Mapping and Execution:**  Map each classified gesture to a specific smart home action.  For the prototype, this could be simulated by printing the action to the console or triggering a simple on/off function.  If a smart home hub is used, integrate with its API.

5. **Refinement and Testing:**  Test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions. Refine the classifier as needed to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in hand size, lighting conditions, and user posture.  Experimentation with different classifiers and feature extraction techniques may be necessary.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing the camera feed and classifying gestures in real-time requires efficient algorithms and code optimization to minimize latency.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  This project provides hands-on experience with real-time computer vision techniques, including hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Machine Learning for Classification:**  The project reinforces understanding of basic machine learning algorithms (e.g., k-NN, SVM) for classification tasks.
