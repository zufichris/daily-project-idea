# Minimalist Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified inverse kinematics solver for a 2-DOF robotic arm.  The solver will take a target (x, y) coordinate as input and calculate the corresponding joint angles needed to reach that position.  This is a fundamental problem in robotics, and a streamlined solution allows for rapid prototyping and testing of control algorithms.  The focus is on efficient implementation and visualization, rather than a full-fledged simulation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for visualization)
* **Optional:**  A robotic arm simulator (e.g., PyBullet) for testing against a real-world model (if time permits).

## Features & Requirements

- **Inverse Kinematics Calculation:**  The core function will compute the joint angles (θ1, θ2) given the target (x, y) coordinates.  It should handle various arm lengths and configurations.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A simple GUI will allow users to input target coordinates and visualize the robot arm's movement.
- **Error Handling:** The solver should gracefully handle cases where the target position is unreachable (e.g., outside the arm's workspace).
- **Visualization:** Real-time plotting of the robot arm's position and the target point.
- **Solution Display:** Clearly display calculated joint angles (θ1, θ2)

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a Jacobian-based iterative solution for improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Integrate with a simple robotic arm simulator (if available hardware/software is accessible).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Mathematical Model:** Define the forward kinematics equations for a 2-DOF robotic arm.  Derive the inverse kinematics equations using geometric or algebraic methods (e.g., solving the system of equations).
2. **Core Function Implementation:**  Implement the inverse kinematics function in Python using NumPy for efficient calculations.  Include error handling for unreachable positions.
3. **GUI Development:** Create a basic GUI using Matplotlib or a simpler library to accept user input and display results.  Plot the robot arm's configuration.
4. **Visualization:**  Use Matplotlib to dynamically update the plot as the user changes the target coordinates.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the solver with various inputs, ensuring accuracy and robustness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Singularities:**  The inverse kinematics solution may have multiple solutions or singularities (positions where the solution is undefined).  Handling these cases requires careful consideration.
- **Accuracy:**  Numerical approximations might lead to minor inaccuracies in joint angle calculations.  Using appropriate libraries and careful implementation can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Inverse Kinematics concepts:** This project provides hands-on experience with solving a fundamental problem in robotics.
- **Practical application of Python libraries:** This project allows for practical application of NumPy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for data visualization and GUI development.
