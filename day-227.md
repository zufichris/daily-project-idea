# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a gesture-recognition system using a TinyML approach.  The system will be designed to control a simple smart home device (e.g., a smart light) based on a limited set of hand gestures captured by a low-power microcontroller equipped with a sensor. This demonstrates practical applications of TinyML for resource-constrained environments and explores efficient model training and deployment.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with onboard sensor capabilities)
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino framework)
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
* **Sensor:**  Onboard accelerometer and/or gyroscope of the chosen microcontroller.
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Acquisition:** Capture accelerometer/gyroscope data representing distinct gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, circular motion for dimming).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implement appropriate filtering and feature extraction techniques to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training:** Train a simple TensorFlow Lite Micro model using a pre-existing dataset or collected data.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model to the microcontroller.
- **Smart Home Control:** Interface the microcontroller with a smart home device (e.g., control an LED's brightness).

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement real-time gesture classification with feedback to the user (e.g., an LED indicating successful gesture recognition).
- **Optional Feature:**  Add gesture classification visualization on a connected display (requires additional hardware).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect sensor data representing various gestures. Preprocess the data by filtering noise and extracting relevant features (e.g., using Fast Fourier Transform).
2. **Model Training:** Use a suitable dataset (either collected or a public dataset like UCI HAR Dataset - simplified) to train a lightweight TensorFlow Lite Micro model (e.g., a simple k-NN or decision tree).  Focus on a small model size for efficient deployment.
3. **Model Conversion & Deployment:** Convert the trained model to a TensorFlow Lite Micro format compatible with the microcontroller. Deploy the model to the Arduino.
4. **Smart Home Integration:**  Establish communication between the microcontroller and the smart home device (e.g., using a simple relay to control the LED).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the model and preprocessing steps as necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Limited Computational Resources:** Microcontrollers have limited processing power and memory, necessitating the use of lightweight models. Careful model selection and optimization are crucial.
- **Sensor Noise:**  Dealing with sensor noise in real-time is essential for accurate gesture recognition. Implement appropriate filtering techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Implementation:** Gain practical experience in deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices.
- **Sensor Data Processing:** Develop skills in handling sensor data, noise reduction, and feature extraction.
