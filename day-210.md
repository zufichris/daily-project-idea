# Mini-Project: Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary smart home appliance control system using a Raspberry Pi, a microphone, and a camera. The system will allow users to control a simulated appliance (e.g., a lamp) via voice commands and simple hand gestures, demonstrating basic interaction and control algorithms.  This is a simplified model to explore the integration of multiple input modalities for smart home devices.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), PyAudio (audio input), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), RPi.GPIO (Raspberry Pi GPIO control)
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (model 3 or 4), USB microphone, USB webcam
* **Software:**  Raspberry Pi OS (with necessary libraries installed)

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Recognize predefined voice commands ("Turn on lamp," "Turn off lamp") to control the simulated appliance.
- **Gesture Control:** Detect simple hand gestures (e.g., waving hand up/down) using OpenCV to control the simulated appliance.
- **Simulated Appliance:** Implement a simple digital representation of an appliance (e.g., an LED on the Pi or a simulated output)
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual or audible feedback confirming successful commands.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for voice and gesture recognition failures.

- **Advanced Features:** (Optional)  Introduce a more sophisticated gesture recognition system (e.g., using MediaPipe).
- **Advanced Features:** (Optional) Integrate with a home automation framework (e.g., Home Assistant) for broader device control.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Installation:** Set up the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries (OpenCV, PyAudio, SpeechRecognition, RPi.GPIO), and connect the microphone and camera.
2. **Voice Recognition Module:** Implement the voice recognition module using SpeechRecognition.  Train the model on simple commands and handle potential speech recognition errors.
3. **Gesture Recognition Module:** Develop the gesture recognition module using OpenCV.  Implement basic gesture detection (e.g., simple hand movements) to trigger appliance control.
4. **Appliance Control:**  Create a function to simulate appliance control based on voice and gesture inputs, updating the simulated output accordingly.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Combine the voice and gesture recognition modules with the appliance control, test functionality, and refine error handling.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech & Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy in real-time can be challenging.  Consider using pre-trained models and addressing potential noise interference.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing real-time processing requirements with computational resources on the Raspberry Pi may require optimization techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multi-Modal Input Processing:** This project will reinforce skills in integrating and processing different input modalities (voice, gesture) for interactive applications.
- **Real-time System Design:**  Experience designing and implementing a real-time application, managing resource constraints, and addressing latency.
