# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a quick and efficient calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to create a system that automatically calibrates the robot's end-effector position relative to a known target, improving accuracy and reducing manual setup time.  This is significant because accurate calibration is crucial for many robotic applications, and a streamlined automated approach can save significant time and effort.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, PySerial depending on the arm's interface).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR5), a camera (any webcam or dedicated camera will suffice), a checkerboard pattern or other easily detectable marker.


## Features & Requirements

- **Automatic Target Detection:**  The system should automatically detect a calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard) in the camera's field of view.
- **Pose Estimation:** The system should estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the target in the camera's coordinate system using OpenCV's solvePnP function.
- **Transformation Calculation:** The system should calculate the transformation matrix between the camera's coordinate system and the robot's coordinate system.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** The system should command the robotic arm to move to a specific location calculated based on the calibration.
- **Error Minimization (Optional):** Implement an iterative refinement process to minimize any residual errors.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Include a user interface (GUI) for easier interaction and parameter adjustment.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Incorporate a method for handling occlusions or noisy images.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Target Detection:** Set up the camera and robotic arm.  Load the camera image, and implement a function to detect the checkerboard using OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners`.
2. **Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to estimate the 3D pose of the checkerboard relative to the camera.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Calculate the transformation matrix between the camera and robot coordinate systems.  This may require pre-defined parameters or a known transformation based on the physical setup.
4. **Robotic Arm Movement:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move to a calculated position based on the transformation and target position.
5. **Verification & Refinement (Optional):** Verify the arm's position using the camera and iteratively refine the calibration if necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Camera Calibration:** Accurate camera calibration is crucial for accurate pose estimation.  If not already calibrated, this will add time to the project.
- **Robot-Camera Coordinate System Alignment:** Accurately defining the relationship between the robot's coordinate system and the camera's coordinate system might require careful measurement and transformation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of Computer Vision:** Reinforces skills in image processing, feature detection, and pose estimation using OpenCV.
- **Robot Control and Calibration:**  Provides hands-on experience in robotic arm control and the challenges of coordinating multiple coordinate systems.
