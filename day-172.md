# Automated Code Style Enforcer with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to create a command-line tool that automatically enforces a customizable code style for Python projects.  The tool will read a configuration file specifying style rules and then analyze Python source code, identifying and reporting violations.  This is significant for maintaining consistent code quality across projects and teams, reducing code review time, and improving readability.  A daily challenge focuses on creating a basic but functional prototype.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python:** Programming language for the tool itself.
- **`ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees):** Python library for parsing and analyzing Python code.
- **`argparse`:** Python library for creating command-line interfaces.
- **`toml` or `yaml`:**  Library for parsing configuration files (choose one).
- **Text editor/IDE:** For coding.

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:** The tool should read a configuration file (e.g., TOML or YAML) defining code style rules (e.g., maximum line length, indentation style, spacing around operators).
- **Code Analysis:**  The tool should parse Python code using the `ast` module and check for violations of the defined rules.
- **Violation Reporting:** The tool should report violations with clear messages indicating the line number and type of violation.
- **Command-line Interface:** The tool should accept the path to the configuration file and the Python source code as command-line arguments.
- **Output Formatting:**  Output should be clear, concise, and easy to understand (e.g., JSON or plain text).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Auto-correction of simple violations (e.g., adding missing semicolons or fixing indentation).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Support for multiple Python file analysis within a directory.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Configuration File Parsing:** Implement functionality to read and parse the configuration file, storing the rules in a suitable data structure (dictionary).
2. **AST-Based Code Analysis:** Write a function to parse the Python code using `ast`, traversing the AST to check for violations based on the rules from the configuration file.
3. **Violation Reporting:** Implement a function to generate formatted reports (e.g., JSON or plain text) detailing the violations found.
4. **Command-line Interface:**  Use `argparse` to create a simple command-line interface for specifying the configuration file and input code path.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate the components and thoroughly test the tool with various input files and configuration files.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Complex Syntax:**  The `ast` module might not cover all edge cases of Python syntax; robust error handling is necessary.
- **Rule Definition Complexity:** Defining a flexible and comprehensive system for specifying rules in the configuration file requires careful design.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of Python's `ast` module for static code analysis.
- Gain experience in building command-line tools using `argparse` and handling configuration files.
