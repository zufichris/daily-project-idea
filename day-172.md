# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing micro-gestures captured by a standard webcam.  The system will recognize predefined hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right for volume control, hand wave for lights on/off) and trigger corresponding actions within a simulated smart home environment.  This is significant because it explores a more intuitive and contactless interaction method compared to traditional voice or touch-based controls.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  a lightweight MQTT client library (like paho-mqtt) for communication.
- **Tools:**  A standard webcam, a Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).  A simulated smart home environment can be implemented using simple libraries like `rpi_gpio` (if simulating actual GPIO controls) or by creating a dummy API for demonstration.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurately track hand position and orientation from the webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, wave).
- **Smart Home Action Triggering:**  Map recognized gestures to specific actions (e.g., increase/decrease volume, toggle lights).
- **User Interface (UI):** Simple display showing the recognized gesture and the triggered action.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Log gesture data for future training and improvement.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, MQTT client).
2. **Hand Tracking & Preprocessing:** Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe, and extract relevant features (e.g., landmark coordinates).  Preprocess the data for noise reduction.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Implement a simple gesture classifier (e.g., using k-Nearest Neighbors or a small neural network). Train it on a small dataset of pre-recorded gestures.
4. **Smart Home Simulation & Integration:**  Create a simulated smart home environment and link recognized gestures to actions.
5. **UI Development:** Develop a basic UI to display the recognized gesture and triggered action.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and speed of gesture recognition can be challenging, especially with limited computational resources. Using optimized algorithms and efficient data structures is key.
- **Gesture Variability:**  Handling variations in hand size, shape, and lighting conditions to ensure robustness is crucial.  Data augmentation techniques can help mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Hands-on experience with real-time hand tracking, feature extraction, and gesture classification.
- **Software Engineering Best Practices:**  Practicing efficient code structure, modularity, and debugging within a time-constrained project.
