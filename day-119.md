# Minimalist Robotic Arm Path Planning with Collision Avoidance

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified path planning algorithm for a robotic arm to reach a target position while avoiding obstacles. The algorithm will be designed for minimal computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time implementation on resource-constrained robotic systems.  The focus is on a proof-of-concept demonstrating efficient pathfinding, ideal for a short-term challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization), potentially a simple robotics simulation library like PyBullet (optional, for faster prototyping).
* **Tools:**  A text editor/IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Target Point Navigation:** The robotic arm should be able to plan and execute a path to a specified target (x, y, z) coordinate.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The algorithm must detect and avoid static obstacles defined by simple geometric shapes (circles, squares).
- **Joint Limit Consideration:** The planned path must respect the physical joint limits of a simplified robotic arm model (e.g., assuming 3 revolute joints).
- **Path Visualization:**  The planned path should be visualized using Matplotlib to verify correctness.
- **Basic Error Handling:**  The algorithm should gracefully handle cases where no collision-free path is found.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporate a dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy (simple reactive approach).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated path planning algorithm like RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) â€“  this would significantly increase complexity.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Simplified Arm Model & Environment:** Define a simplified 3-DOF robotic arm model with joint limits and create a 2D or 3D environment with obstacle representations.
2. **Path Planning Algorithm:** Implement a basic path planning algorithm (e.g., a simplified A* or a greedy approach) to find a collision-free path to the target. This will be the most challenging part, focusing on efficiency for the time constraint.
3. **Collision Detection:** Implement a function to detect collisions between the robotic arm links and obstacles.  Simple geometric checks (e.g., circle-circle intersection) are sufficient for this challenge.
4. **Path Execution & Visualization:** Simulate the arm's movement along the planned path and visualize the results using Matplotlib. This could involve simple joint angle interpolation.
5. **Refinement & Testing:** Test the algorithm with different target positions and obstacle configurations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Finding an efficient path planning algorithm that works within the time constraint is the main challenge.  A highly optimized but simple algorithm should be the priority.
- **Collision Detection Accuracy:** Implementing robust collision detection for complex arm geometries can be computationally expensive. Simplifications are necessary for this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Path Planning Concepts:** The project reinforces understanding of fundamental path planning algorithms and their implementation.
- **Practical Experience with Robotics Simulation:**  Even without a physical robot, the project provides practical experience with robotic arm kinematics and simulation.
