# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple self-balancing robotic arm using a microcontroller and PID control algorithm.  The goal is to build a miniature arm that can maintain its balance while supporting a small weight at its end effector, demonstrating a foundational concept in robotics control systems.  This project focuses on rapid prototyping and implementation, prioritizing core functionality over complex design.


## Technologies & Tools

- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (or similar)
- Motors: Two micro servo motors (e.g., SG90)
- IMU Sensor: MPU6050 (for acceleration and gyroscope data)
- Programming Language: C++ (Arduino IDE)
- Libraries:  Wire.h (for I2C communication with IMU), Servo.h (for servo motor control)


## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain its upright position even with slight disturbances.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  The system should utilize a PID controller to adjust motor angles based on IMU feedback.
- **Servo Motor Control:** Precise control of two servo motors for arm articulation and balance.
- **IMU Data Acquisition and Processing:**  Accurate reading and interpretation of IMU data (acceleration and angular velocity).
- **Basic Physical Structure:** A simple, easily constructible arm using readily available materials (e.g., cardboard, wood, or 3D-printed parts).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Calibration routine for IMU offset,  implementation of a different control algorithm (e.g., LQR).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU, servo motors, and power supply to the Arduino.  Assemble a basic arm structure.
2. **IMU Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Write code to read raw data from the IMU and perform basic calibration to account for sensor offsets.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a PID controller to stabilize the arm based on angular position and velocity from the IMU.  Start with simple PID gains and tune them iteratively.
4. **Servo Motor Control Integration:**  Integrate the PID controller's output to control the servo motors, adjusting their angles to maintain balance.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system, adjusting PID gains to optimize performance and stability.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains requires iterative experimentation and might be time-consuming.  Start with conservative gains and gradually increase them.
- **IMU Noise:**  IMU data can be noisy, leading to unstable control.  Implementing a simple filter (e.g., moving average) can mitigate this issue.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Algorithm Implementation:** Gain practical experience in implementing and tuning a PID controller, a core concept in robotics and control systems.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Improve proficiency in C++ programming for embedded systems, including sensor interfacing and motor control.
