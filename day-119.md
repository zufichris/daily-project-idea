# Mini-Game AI Agent using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, using reinforcement learning techniques.  The focus is on building a functional prototype within a short timeframe, demonstrating the core principles of RL in a practical setting.  This allows for quick exploration of different RL algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (for game environment, if available), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning model), NumPy
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Agent learns to play a chosen game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe) against a simple rule-based opponent.
    - Implements a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).
    - Tracks and displays the agent's performance metrics (e.g., win rate, average reward).
- **Optional Features:**
    - Visualization of the agent's learning process (e.g., plotting win rate over time).
    - Implementation of a more advanced RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Choose a game environment (either create a simple custom one or utilize OpenAI Gym if a suitable environment exists). Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement the chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning). Define the agent's learning rate, discount factor, and exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updates the agent's Q-values based on the received rewards, and tracks performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance against the rule-based opponent or another instance of the trained agent.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Plot the agent's win rate or average reward over the training episodes to visualize its learning progress.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) for the chosen RL algorithm can require experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and adjust based on observation.
- **Computational Resources:** Depending on the chosen RL algorithm (especially DQN), training might require significant computational power if many iterations are needed. Consider simplifying the game or reducing training iterations for a shorter timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: Gain practical experience with core RL concepts like state-action spaces, rewards, Q-learning, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
- Model Building & Evaluation: Practice building and evaluating a simple machine learning model using appropriate metrics.
