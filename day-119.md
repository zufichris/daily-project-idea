# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures in front of a camera and trigger pre-defined smart home actions.  This allows for intuitive and contactless control, particularly useful in scenarios requiring hygiene or ease of access.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for on-device inference)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, Computer (with reasonable processing power)
- **Optional:**  A Raspberry Pi for embedded deployment (more challenging, might not be fully achievable in 2 days).


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, thumbs up).
- **Action Mapping:**  Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **User Interface:** A simple visual interface displaying the recognized gesture and the corresponding action.
- **Calibration:**  Option to calibrate gesture recognition for individual users.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple machine learning model (using TensorFlow Lite) for improved gesture recognition accuracy.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant) to control actual devices.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Hand Tracking:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).  Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe's solutions. Display the tracked hand landmarks on the webcam feed.
2. **Gesture Definition and Recognition:** Define thresholds and criteria for recognizing the chosen gestures based on hand landmark positions and distances. Implement logic to classify the detected hand into one of the defined gestures.
3. **Action Triggering:**  Create a mapping between the recognized gestures and specific actions (e.g., using simple print statements or simulated actions initially).
4. **User Interface:** Develop a basic graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt to display the recognized gesture and the triggered action.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system with various hand gestures and lighting conditions. Refine the gesture recognition logic to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to variations in lighting and hand positioning:**  The accuracy of hand tracking and gesture recognition can be affected by changes in lighting conditions or inconsistencies in hand placement.  Addressing this may require more advanced image processing techniques or data augmentation.
- **Real-time performance:** Processing the webcam feed in real-time can be computationally intensive. Optimization techniques might be necessary to maintain acceptable frame rates.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical skills in computer vision:** This project strengthens understanding of real-time image processing, feature extraction, and gesture recognition techniques.
- **Develop proficiency in using OpenCV and MediaPipe:** Hands-on experience with these powerful libraries for computer vision tasks will enhance the understanding and application of these tools.
