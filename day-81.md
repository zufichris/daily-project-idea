# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model. This allows for a more intuitive and hands-free interaction with smart home technology, eliminating the need for voice commands or physical interfaces in certain scenarios.  The prototype will focus on a limited set of gestures and devices for a feasible daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation),  Flask (optional - for web interface)
* **Hardware:** Webcam (or built-in camera), Raspberry Pi (optional - for deployment)
* **Software:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:** The system should accurately recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open hand for "on," closed fist for "off," thumbs up for "increase brightness").
- **Device Control:**  The system should control at least one smart home device (e.g., a smart bulb simulated with a simple Python script, or a real device via its API if available).
- **Real-time Processing:**  The gesture recognition should process camera input in real-time, with minimal latency.
- **Visual Feedback:** The system should provide visual feedback (e.g., on-screen display) indicating the recognized gesture and its effect on the controlled device.
- **Calibration (Optional):** Allow the user to calibrate the system to their specific hand size and gestures.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Device Control:** Extend control to multiple smart devices.
- **Web Interface:** Develop a simple web interface for remote monitoring and control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).
2. **Implement Gesture Recognition:** Use MediaPipe's pose estimation model to detect and classify hand gestures.  Focus on a small set of easily distinguishable gestures.
3. **Integrate Device Control:**  Write a simple script to simulate or control a smart device based on the recognized gesture.  This could be as simple as changing a variable representing a light's state.
4. **Develop Visual Feedback:** Display the recognized gesture and device status on the screen.
5. **Test and Refine:** Test the system thoroughly, adjusting parameters and refining the gesture recognition as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with real-time processing and diverse hand sizes/positions might be challenging.  Consider simplifying the gestures to improve accuracy.
- **Robustness to Lighting Conditions:**  The system's performance might be affected by varying lighting conditions. Experiment with different image processing techniques to improve robustness.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience with computer vision libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Real-time System Development:** Develop skills in building and optimizing real-time applications.
