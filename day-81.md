# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent that learns to play a miniature game using reinforcement learning. The game will be a simplified version of a classic game, like Tic-Tac-Toe or a custom-designed grid-based game, allowing for quick prototyping and iterative improvement within a short timeframe.  The focus will be on implementing a basic Q-learning algorithm and observing its learning progress. This project demonstrates fundamental reinforcement learning concepts in a tangible and easily testable environment.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  NumPy, Pygame (for visualization, optional), a reinforcement learning library (e.g., RLlib or a custom implementation).


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Engine:**  A simple, text-based or graphical representation of the game board and game rules.
- **Q-Learning Agent:** An agent that learns optimal actions through trial and error using the Q-learning algorithm.
- **Training Loop:** A function to repeatedly train the agent against itself or a simple rule-based opponent.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics to track the agent's learning progress, such as win rate or average reward.
- **State Representation:**  A clear way to represent the game state as input for the Q-learning algorithm (e.g., a flattened array).

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement Îµ-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Visualize the Q-values or the agent's learning curve using Pygame or a plotting library.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Design & Implementation:** Define the rules and create a basic representation of the game (either text-based or graphical).
2. **Q-Learning Algorithm Implementation:**  Implement the core Q-learning update rule and functions for choosing actions based on Q-values.
3. **Training Loop Development:** Create a loop to repeatedly train the agent, updating Q-values based on rewards received.
4. **Performance Tracking:** Incorporate metrics to track the agent's win rate or average reward over training episodes.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Run the training loop, observe the agent's learning progress, and refine parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Space Size:**  For more complex games, the state space can become large, potentially slowing down training.  Consider state aggregation or function approximation techniques if needed.
- **Reward Function Design:** Choosing an appropriate reward function that guides the agent towards desirable behavior is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to unexpected or suboptimal behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with the Q-learning algorithm and its application.
- **Agent Design and Implementation:** Develop skills in designing and implementing an AI agent that learns through interaction with an environment.
