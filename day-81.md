# Optimized Image Compression for Embedded Systems

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a lightweight image compression algorithm optimized for resource-constrained embedded systems.  Many embedded devices, like smartwatches or low-power IoT sensors, have limited processing power and memory.  This project aims to create a compression technique that achieves a high compression ratio while maintaining acceptable image quality and minimizing computational overhead.  The significance lies in enabling efficient image transmission and storage in such systems.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** C++ (for performance)
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), potentially a lightweight compression library like zlib or a custom implementation.
- **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion), a test image dataset.


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Loading & Preprocessing:** Load images in common formats (e.g., JPG, PNG) and perform basic preprocessing steps (resizing, color space conversion).
- **Compression Algorithm:** Implement a simplified version of a lossy compression algorithm like DCT-based compression (a subset of JPEG) or a simpler, custom algorithm focusing on speed.
- **Decompression Algorithm:**  Implement the corresponding decompression algorithm.
- **Performance Measurement:** Measure compression ratio and processing time.
- **Image Quality Assessment:**  Quantify image quality using a metric like PSNR or SSIM.

- **Optional Feature 1:**  Adaptive quantization based on image content.
- **Optional Feature 2:**  Support for different compression levels to balance quality and size.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Image Loading:** Set up the development environment, install necessary libraries, and implement image loading and preprocessing functions.
2. **Compression Algorithm Implementation:** Implement a simplified DCT-based compression algorithm or a custom algorithm, focusing on speed and a good compression ratio.
3. **Decompression Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the corresponding decompression algorithm.
4. **Performance Testing:**  Test the algorithm on a variety of images and measure compression ratios, processing times, and image quality using suitable metrics.
5. **Refinement & Optimization:** Analyze the results and refine the algorithm for improved performance or explore optional features.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Compression Ratio and Speed:** Finding the optimal balance between compression ratio and processing speed on a constrained system will be crucial. This requires careful algorithm design and potentially experimentation with different parameters.
- **Memory Management:** Efficient memory management is essential, especially when dealing with large images on systems with limited RAM. Careful allocation and deallocation are necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Optimization:** This project reinforces understanding of optimization techniques for resource-constrained environments, including algorithm selection, data structure choices, and memory management.
- **Image Compression Fundamentals:**  A deeper understanding of image compression techniques, specifically lossy compression algorithms, will be gained through this practical implementation.
