# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm.  The game will include a visual representation of the board and the AI's decision-making process, highlighting the explored game tree.  This provides a practical application of a fundamental AI concept within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for GUI), NumPy (optional, for board representation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Board:** A visually appealing Tic-Tac-Toe board displayed using Pygame.
- **Human Player Input:**  Ability for a human player to make moves by clicking on the board.
- **Minimax AI:** An AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- **Win/Draw Detection:** Accurate detection of win or draw conditions.
- **Visualized Decision Tree (Optional):**  A simplified visualization of the Minimax tree, showing the AI's considered moves (partially explored tree is acceptable).

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Difficulty levels that adjust the search depth of the Minimax algorithm.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Implementation of Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize the Minimax algorithm's performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Pygame:** Create the game window and draw the Tic-Tac-Toe board using Pygame.
2. **Implement Human Input:**  Handle mouse clicks to register human player moves.
3. **Implement Minimax Algorithm:**  Develop a recursive Minimax function to determine the AI's optimal move.
4. **Integrate AI and Human Turns:**  Alternate between human and AI turns, updating the board after each move.
5. **Add Win/Draw Detection and Visual Feedback:**  Check for win or draw conditions and display appropriate messages; optionally, display the Minimax decision tree elements.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Implementation:**  Correctly implementing the Minimax algorithm recursively, handling base cases and evaluating game states.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Efficiently visualizing the Minimax decision tree without overwhelming the user interface; a simplified representation might be necessary within the time constraints.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of the Minimax algorithm:** This project provides hands-on experience in designing and implementing a fundamental AI search algorithm.
- **Game development with Pygame:**  Building a simple but functional game using Pygame strengthens GUI development skills in Python.
