# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm.  The game will include a visual representation of the board and game state, allowing for observation of the AI's decision-making process.  This provides a practical application of a classic AI algorithm in a limited timeframe, focusing on efficient coding and algorithm implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for GUI), NumPy (optional, for board representation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Board:** A visually appealing 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- **Player Input:**  Allow human players to make moves using mouse clicks or keyboard input.
- **Minimax AI:** Implement the Minimax algorithm to control the AI opponent's moves.
- **Win/Draw Detection:**  Accurately detect win and draw conditions.
- **Game Reset:** Ability to easily reset the game for a new match.

- **Advanced Features:**  Visual representation of the Minimax tree (partially, for smaller depths),  difficulty levels by limiting the search depth of Minimax.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Game Board:** Create the visual representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board using Pygame.  Initialize the game state (empty board).
2. **Implement Player Input:**  Handle player clicks or keyboard input to place their markers on the board, updating the game state accordingly.
3. **Implement Minimax Algorithm:** Code the Minimax algorithm to determine the AI's optimal move based on the current game state.  Consider using alpha-beta pruning for optimization if time permits.
4. **Win/Draw Condition Check:**  Implement functions to check for win or draw conditions after each move.
5. **Game Loop and Display:** Integrate the above components into a main game loop, updating the display after each move.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Optimization:**  The Minimax algorithm can be computationally expensive for larger search depths.  Finding a balance between performance and AI strength is crucial within the time constraint. Consider using alpha-beta pruning to improve efficiency.
- **GUI Integration:**  Smoothly integrating the game logic with the Pygame visual representation may require careful planning and debugging.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of AI Algorithms:** This project provides hands-on experience implementing and understanding the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental concept in game AI.
- **GUI Development Practice:**  The use of Pygame will reinforce skills in GUI development, event handling, and game loop design.
