# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of predefined micro-gestures, eliminating the need for large, easily misinterpreted hand movements. This offers a more natural and less obtrusive interaction method compared to voice commands or touch interfaces.  The prototype will demonstrate the feasibility and speed of implementing such a system.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model optimization/deployment)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, (optional) Raspberry Pi for deployment


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture & Processing:** Real-time capture of webcam feed and processing to extract hand pose data.
- **Micro-Gesture Recognition:** Recognition of 3-4 predefined micro-gestures (e.g., slight hand raise, finger curl, etc.)
- **Device Control:** Mapping recognized gestures to specific smart home device actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).
- **User Interface:** A simple visual display indicating recognized gestures and the corresponding actions.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record recognized gestures and timestamps for analysis and model improvement.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:**  Record a short video dataset of the chosen micro-gestures.  Focus on consistent lighting and background to minimize noise.
2. **Pose Estimation:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking model to extract keypoints from the video frames.  Extract relevant features from these keypoints.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Train a simple classifier (e.g., a k-Nearest Neighbors or Support Vector Machine model) to differentiate between the gestures.
4. **Integration & Control:** Integrate the classifier with a smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant) to trigger device actions based on gesture recognition.
5. **UI Development:** Create a basic GUI (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt) to display the recognized gesture and the controlled device's status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to Noise:**  Dealing with varying lighting conditions, background clutter, and hand occlusion can be challenging. Employing image preprocessing techniques (e.g., background subtraction) is crucial.
- **Accuracy & Speed:** Balancing the accuracy of gesture recognition with the speed of real-time processing is a key challenge.  Optimizing the model and choosing appropriate algorithms are essential.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with computer vision:**  Hands-on application of pose estimation and gesture recognition techniques.
- **Model training and evaluation:**  Building and evaluating a simple machine learning model for a real-world application.
