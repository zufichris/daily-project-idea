# Smart Home Device Integration with Custom Voice Commands

## Overview

This project focuses on building a prototype for integrating a smart home device (e.g., a smart lamp, thermostat, or a simulated one) with a custom voice command system.  The goal is to create a simple yet functional voice-controlled interface that goes beyond pre-defined commands, allowing for more flexible control.  This demonstrates a practical application of speech recognition and home automation technologies within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Speech Recognition Library:** SpeechRecognition (with potentially a cloud-based service like Google Speech-to-Text for enhanced accuracy)
* **Text-to-Speech Library:** pyttsx3
* **Home Automation Framework (Optional):**  Home Assistant API (if integrating with a real smart home device), otherwise, a simulated device using simple I/O.

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Command Recognition:**  The system should accurately recognize a set of custom voice commands (e.g., "Set lamp to 50%", "Increase temperature by 2 degrees").
- **Smart Device Control:** The system should execute the corresponding actions based on recognized commands, controlling the simulated or real smart device.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling to gracefully manage unrecognized commands or device communication failures.
- **Feedback Mechanism:**  Provide textual or audio feedback to the user confirming the action taken or indicating an error.
- **Command Expansion (Optional):**  Allow for adding/removing custom commands easily.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Configuration:** Install necessary libraries, set up the simulated or real smart device connection (if using a physical device).
2. **Voice Command Processing:** Implement the core logic for capturing audio input using the SpeechRecognition library, processing it, and extracting the intended command.
3. **Action Execution:**  Map recognized commands to specific actions on the smart device (e.g., setting brightness, changing temperature). Implement this using the chosen home automation framework or by directly controlling the simulated device.
4. **Feedback Implementation:** Integrate a feedback mechanism (textual output or TTS) to inform the user about the system's actions and any errors.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with various voice commands and refine the command recognition and action execution based on the results.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:** Speech recognition can be affected by background noise or different accents. Using a cloud-based service might improve accuracy but adds dependence on external services.
- **Smart Device Integration:** Integrating with a real smart home device might require more setup and configuration than using a simulated device.  Ensure compatibility before starting.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on experience with speech recognition and natural language processing techniques.**
- **Practical application of home automation concepts and API integrations.**
