# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it. The focus will be on rapid prototyping and showcasing the core concepts of RL in a practical application.  The game will be text-based for ease of implementation within the time constraint.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Pygame (for optional GUI - can be skipped for text-based version)
- NumPy
- A reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple text-based game (e.g., a simplified version of Snake or a grid-based maze navigation).
    - An RL agent using a Q-learning algorithm.
    -  Basic reward system to guide the agent's learning.
    -  Ability to train and test the agent.
    -  Output of agent's performance metrics (e.g., average reward, win rate).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  A graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame to visualize the game and the agent's actions.
    -  Implementation of a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Design & Implementation:** Define the game rules and create a basic Python implementation.  Keep it extremely simple (e.g., a 5x5 grid).
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (start with Q-learning) and integrate it with the game.  Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively runs the game with the agent, updates the agent's policy based on the rewards received.
4. **Testing & Evaluation:** Test the trained agent and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., average reward per episode).
5. **Optional: GUI Integration:** If time permits, add a basic GUI using Pygame to visualize the game.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging and require iterative refinement.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the RL algorithm may require experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes

-  Practical understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., Q-learning, state-action space, reward functions).
-  Experience in implementing and evaluating an RL agent in a simple game environment.
