# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic AI-powered image captioning system tailored for robot navigation. The system will take an image as input from a robot's camera and generate a short, descriptive caption summarizing the scene's relevant features (e.g., "Clear path ahead," "Obstacle detected: box to the left," "Stairs ahead"). This caption can then be used by a robot's navigation system to make informed decisions.  The significance lies in providing a more robust and adaptable navigation system, particularly in unstructured or dynamic environments.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning model), transformers (for pre-trained language model)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN), a pre-trained captioning model (e.g., from Hugging Face)


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Input:** Accepts an image from a specified file path or camera feed.
- **Object Detection:** Detects and identifies key objects within the image (obstacles, paths, landmarks).
- **Caption Generation:** Generates a concise, natural language caption describing the detected objects and their relative positions.
- **Output Display:** Displays the input image alongside the generated caption.
- **Basic Scene Understanding:** Differentiates between open paths and obstacles.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Incorporate spatial reasoning to better describe object relationships (e.g., "Box to the left of the table").
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple decision-making module based on the caption (e.g., "Turn left to avoid obstacle").


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained object detection and captioning model.
2. **Image Processing & Object Detection:** Implement image input and object detection using OpenCV and the chosen pre-trained model.  Focus on identifying key objects relevant for navigation.
3. **Caption Generation:** Integrate the captioning model to generate descriptive captions based on the detected objects and their locations.
4. **Output & Visualization:** Display the input image and the generated caption using Matplotlib or a similar library.
5. **(Optional) Decision Making:** If time permits, implement a simple rule-based system to generate navigational commands based on the caption content.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:**  Processing images and generating captions can be computationally intensive. Using optimized pre-trained models and efficient code is crucial to achieve a functional prototype within the timeframe.
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the pre-trained models will directly impact the quality of the captions and the reliability of any decision-making module.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of image processing techniques** using OpenCV.
- **Gain practical experience integrating pre-trained deep learning models** for object detection and caption generation.
