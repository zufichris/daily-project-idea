# Self-Healing Robotic Arm Path Planning with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified simulation of a robotic arm that can autonomously replan its path in the presence of unexpected obstacles.  The focus is on incorporating a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to allow for dynamic path adjustments, making it a challenging yet achievable project within a couple of days. This demonstrates a core concept in robotics: robust path planning.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), PyTorch (or TensorFlow) for RL, NumPy for numerical computation
* **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:** Q-learning (simplified for daily scope)
* **Robotics Simulation:**  A simple 2D robotic arm simulation within Pygame.

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Arm Simulation:** A 2D robotic arm with two joints, capable of reaching target positions.
- **Obstacle Detection:**  The simulation includes randomly placed obstacles.
- **Path Planning:** The arm plans a path to a target, avoiding obstacles.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** A Q-learning agent learns to avoid obstacles and reach the target efficiently.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Tracks the success rate and path length.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network â€“ DQN) if time permits.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Add different obstacle types with varying degrees of difficulty.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Create a basic 2D robotic arm simulation using Pygame. Define the arm's kinematics and create a function to check for collisions with obstacles.
2. **Implement a Basic Path Planner:**  Use a simple algorithm (e.g., a heuristic-based approach) to generate an initial path to the target.
3. **Integrate Q-learning:** Design a state space (e.g., arm joint angles, obstacle proximity) and action space (e.g., joint angle changes).  Implement the Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal actions.
4. **Train the Agent:** Run the simulation, allowing the agent to learn through trial and error.  Use a simple reward system (e.g., positive reward for reaching the target, negative reward for collisions).
5. **Evaluate Performance:**  Assess the agent's ability to avoid obstacles and reach the target consistently.  Analyze path length and success rate.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Space Representation:** Choosing an appropriate state representation for the RL agent is crucial for efficient learning.  Overly complex representations can make learning difficult.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A well-designed reward function is essential for effective learning.  The reward system needs to incentivize obstacle avoidance and efficient path finding.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project provides practical experience implementing and applying a fundamental RL algorithm (Q-learning).
- **Robotics Path Planning:**  Gain experience in designing and implementing path planning algorithms for a robotic system, understanding the challenges of dynamic environments.
