# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and iterative improvement of the AI's performance within a short timeframe. The game itself will be minimalistic to allow for quick development and focus on the AI implementation.  This provides a practical example of applying RL to a real-world (game) scenario.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), Stable Baselines3 (for RL algorithms)
- Tools:  A suitable Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a pong-like game or a simple maze navigation).
    - An AI opponent controlled by a pre-trained RL agent (e.g., PPO or A2C).
    - Basic game mechanics (e.g., movement, collision detection, scoring).
    - Real-time display of the game using Pygame.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Option to train a new RL agent from scratch (requires more time).
    - Integration of a simple user interface for game settings (e.g., difficulty level).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Create the game environment using Pygame.  Focus on a very simple game with minimal graphics. Define game states, actions, and reward functions.
2. **Choose and Load a Pre-trained Agent:** Select a suitable RL algorithm (PPO or A2C are good starting points) and load a pre-trained agent from Stable Baselines3's example models or a similar source.  Avoid training from scratch within the daily timeframe.
3. **Integrate the Agent:**  Connect the pre-trained agent to the game environment. The agent should receive game state information and provide actions based on its policy.
4. **Implement Game Logic and Display:**  Develop the game logic (e.g., scorekeeping, collision detection), and implement the Pygame display to show the game state and the AI's actions.
5. **Test and Refine:** Play the game against the AI. Observe its performance and make necessary adjustments to the game mechanics or agent parameters (if time permits).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Agent Performance:** A pre-trained agent might not perform optimally in a newly created environment.  Careful selection of the agent and environment design is crucial.
- **Debugging:** Integrating the AI with the game might introduce unexpected bugs or inconsistencies.  Thorough testing and debugging are necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Practical application of RL algorithms and understanding their integration within a simple game environment.
- **Game Development:**  Hands-on experience in using a game development library (Pygame) and building basic game mechanics.
