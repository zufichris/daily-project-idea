# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a quick and efficient calibration procedure for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to create a system that automatically determines the robot's end-effector pose (position and orientation) relative to a known target using a camera, eliminating the need for manual calibration which can be time-consuming and prone to error. This is particularly useful for rapid prototyping and deployment of robotic systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computing), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, PySerial depending on the specific arm), potentially a library for solving pose estimation problems (e.g., using a PnP solver).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, inexpensive one will suffice), a calibrated camera (a standard webcam can work), a known target object (e.g., a chessboard pattern).

## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture images from the camera and identify the target object using features detection algorithms (e.g., corner detection using OpenCV).
- **Pose Estimation:** Calculate the 3D pose of the target object in the camera's coordinate system using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
- **Robot Arm Control:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to a predefined position relative to the estimated target pose.
- **Calibration Accuracy:** Evaluate the accuracy of the calibration by comparing the robot's actual position to the desired position (requires some form of distance measurement or visual feedback).
- **Visualization:** Display the camera feed, detected target, and calculated pose estimations for monitoring purposes.

**Advanced Features:**
- **Iterative Refinement:** Implement an iterative calibration procedure to improve accuracy by repeatedly adjusting the robot's pose and recalculating the estimation.
- **Error Compensation:** Incorporate error compensation techniques to account for inaccuracies in the camera calibration or robot kinematics.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Image Acquisition:** Set up the camera and robotic arm, write code to capture images from the camera, and display the feed.
2. **Target Detection & Pose Estimation:** Implement target detection (e.g., using a chessboard pattern and corner detection) and then compute the target's pose using a PnP algorithm from OpenCV.
3. **Robot Arm Control:** Write code to interface with the robotic arm and send commands to move the end-effector to the calculated pose.
4. **Accuracy Evaluation:**  Develop a method to assess the accuracy of the calibration (e.g., measuring the distance between the end-effector and the target).
5. **Refinement (Optional):**  Implement an iterative refinement loop based on the accuracy assessment.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Camera Calibration:** Accurate camera calibration is crucial for accurate pose estimation. Pre-calibrated cameras are recommended to simplify the process; otherwise, camera calibration needs to be performed which is time consuming.
- **Robot Kinematics:** Understanding the robotic arm's kinematics model is necessary to translate the desired pose into appropriate joint angles.  Simplifying assumptions may be necessary to keep within the time constraints.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** Specifically, feature detection and pose estimation algorithms.
- **Gain experience with robotic arm control and interfacing:** Learn how to send commands to a robotic arm and interpret its feedback.
