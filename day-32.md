# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., wave, point, fist) and translate them into commands to control smart devices like lights or music playback. This offers a hands-free, intuitive alternative to traditional voice or app-based controls, addressing accessibility concerns and providing a novel user interface.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), RPi.GPIO (if integrating with physical controls)
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a Raspberry Pi (optional, for physical interaction), a suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Detection:**  Accurate recognition of pre-defined gestures (wave, point, fist).
- **Command Mapping:**  Mapping gestures to specific smart home actions (e.g., wave = turn lights on, point = increase volume).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Processing video frames and triggering actions with minimal latency.
- **Calibration:**  A simple calibration process to adapt to varying lighting conditions and user hand sizes.
- **Feedback Mechanism:**  Visual or auditory feedback confirming gesture recognition and command execution.

- **Advanced Features:**  Support for additional gestures (e.g., swipe for volume control).
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant) for broader device control.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe) and configure the webcam.
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Implement a pipeline using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and classify predefined gestures.  Focus on a subset of gestures for the day's scope.
3. **Command Execution:** Develop a function to map recognized gestures to specific commands (e.g., sending HTTP requests to control smart devices, or controlling GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi).
4. **User Interface:** Create a basic interface (console output or a simple GUI) to display recognized gestures and executed commands.  This could be as simple as printing the gesture to the console.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system's accuracy and responsiveness, and adjust parameters (e.g., gesture detection thresholds) as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand size, and background clutter can impact the accuracy of gesture detection. Using a controlled testing environment initially is recommended.
- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing processing speed with accuracy is crucial for a responsive user experience. Optimizing code and potentially reducing image resolution can improve performance.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** Implementing hand tracking and gesture recognition will solidify knowledge of image processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.
- **Develop skills in real-time application development:**  Building a system that processes data continuously and responds in real-time enhances skills in efficient resource management and event handling.
