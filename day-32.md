#  Miniature Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Robot Simulation

## Overview

This project involves creating a simulated miniature robot that autonomously navigates a virtual environment while avoiding obstacles.  The focus is on implementing a basic pathfinding algorithm and sensor simulation within a limited timeframe. This provides a practical application of core robotics and AI concepts in a simplified, manageable setting.  The simulation can be easily extended later for more complex scenarios.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization and event handling), NumPy (for numerical computation)
* **Optional:**  A simple pathfinding library like `pathfinding`


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Representation:**  The environment will contain randomly placed static obstacles represented as simple shapes (e.g., circles or rectangles).
- **Robot Movement:** The simulated robot should move within the environment, controlled by a basic pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or a simpler approach).
- **Obstacle Detection:** The robot needs a simulated sensor (e.g., a range sensor) to detect nearby obstacles.
- **Path Planning:** The robot should plan a collision-free path to a target location.
- **Visualization:** The simulation should visually represent the robot, obstacles, and the planned path using Pygame.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated sensor model, incorporating sensor noise and limited range.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Allow for dynamic obstacles (moving objects the robot needs to avoid).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the Pygame window and initialize the environment with randomly placed obstacles.
2. **Robot & Sensor Implementation:** Define the robot's properties (position, size, speed) and implement a simple range sensor simulation.
3. **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implement a basic pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or a simplified approach like following the shortest distance to the target, avoiding collisions).
4. **Movement and Obstacle Avoidance:** Integrate the pathfinding algorithm with the robot's movement, ensuring it avoids collisions with obstacles based on sensor readings.
5. **Visualization:** Display the robot, obstacles, path, and sensor readings within the Pygame window.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Pathfinding Algorithm Complexity:**  Implementing a full A* algorithm might be time-consuming. A simpler approach focusing on immediate obstacle avoidance can be sufficient for a daily challenge.
- **Sensor Model Accuracy:** Simulating realistic sensor data (including noise and limitations) can add complexity.  Starting with a simplified model is recommended.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of pathfinding algorithms:** This project allows for practical application and experimentation with different pathfinding techniques.
- **Understanding of basic robotics concepts:**  This project provides hands-on experience with robot simulation, sensor modeling, and basic control systems.
