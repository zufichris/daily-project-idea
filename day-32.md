# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system that responds to subtle hand gestures captured by a readily available webcam.  The focus is on micro-gestures (small, precise movements) rather than large, easily-detected ones, making it more discreet and potentially more accurate than systems relying on broader movements.  This offers a novel and potentially more intuitive control mechanism for smart home devices.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for gesture recognition),  NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Framework (Optional):** Flask or similar for a simple web interface (if time allows).
- **Hardware:** Webcam (most laptops have built-in webcams)

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least 3 distinct micro-gestures (e.g., a subtle finger tap for "on," a quick wrist flick for "off," a circular motion for "adjust brightness").
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Device Control Simulation:** Simulate control of a smart home device (e.g., turn a virtual light on/off) based on recognized gestures.
- **Model Training:**  Use a small, pre-recorded dataset or a simple online dataset for gesture model training.
- **Accuracy Reporting:**  Display a confidence score for each recognized gesture.


- **Advanced Feature 1:** Integrate with a real smart home device (e.g., Philips Hue light bulb) via its API.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a user calibration step to personalize gesture recognition to individual users.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** If not using a pre-trained model, record a small dataset of the chosen micro-gestures using the webcam and OpenCV. Preprocess the video frames (resizing, grayscale conversion, etc.).
2. **Model Training (or Loading):** If training, use a simple machine learning model (e.g., a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier or a small convolutional neural network) to train on the preprocessed gesture data. If using a pre-trained model, load and adapt it to the specific gestures.
3. **Real-time Gesture Detection:** Integrate MediaPipe or a custom solution to process the webcam feed and detect the trained gestures in real-time.
4. **Device Control Simulation:** Implement the logic to trigger simulated smart home device actions based on detected gestures.
5. **UI Development (Optional):** Create a basic web interface (using Flask or similar) to display the recognized gesture and confidence score.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy with subtle micro-gestures requires careful data acquisition and model training. Background noise and variations in lighting conditions can also affect performance.  Consider using background subtraction techniques.
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing of video frames can be computationally intensive. Optimize code for efficiency to ensure smooth operation.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience with image processing, feature extraction, and model training for gesture recognition.
- **Practical application of machine learning:**  This project applies machine learning algorithms to a real-world problem, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing and model selection.
