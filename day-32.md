# AI-Powered Real-time Object Classification for a Robot Arm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple system where a robotic arm (simulated or physical) can identify and classify objects in real-time using a pre-trained AI model.  This demonstrates the integration of computer vision and robotics, a crucial element in many automation tasks. The focus is on a functional prototype showcasing the core integration, not a fully robust industrial-grade system.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for AI model loading & inference), a robotics library (e.g., ROS, PyBullet for simulation).
* **Hardware (optional):** A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR), a camera.
* **AI Model:** A pre-trained model for object detection/classification (e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNet).  Consider using a lightweight model for faster inference.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system should detect objects within the camera's view in real-time.
- **Object Classification:**  The detected objects should be classified into predefined categories (e.g., "ball," "cube," "cylinder").
- **Robotic Arm Control:** The arm should receive the object's location and type from the AI model.
- **Basic Action:** The arm should perform a simple action based on object classification (e.g., pick up a cube, avoid a ball).
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the classified objects and arm movements on screen.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Object Handling:** Handle multiple objects simultaneously.
- **Adaptive Gripper Control:** Adjust the gripper based on the detected object's size and shape.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained object detection model.  If using a physical robot, configure the hardware connection.
2. **Image Acquisition & Processing:** Implement image capture from a camera (or simulated camera) using OpenCV. Preprocess images (resize, normalization).
3. **AI Model Integration:** Load and run the pre-trained model to obtain object detections and classifications.
4. **Robotic Arm Control:**  Send commands to the robotic arm based on object location and type.  Use a suitable robotics library for control.
5. **Visual Feedback:** Display processed images with bounding boxes around detected objects, and visualize arm movements.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Efficiency:** Real-time processing requires efficient model selection and optimization. Using a lightweight model and optimizing image processing are crucial.
- **Hardware Limitations:** Physical robot control might introduce delays and require careful synchronization between vision and actuation.  Using a simulator can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Integration of Computer Vision and Robotics:**  Gain practical experience in combining AI-based object recognition with robotic control.
- **Real-time System Design:**  Understand the challenges and techniques for developing applications requiring fast processing and responsiveness.
