# Mini-Game AI for Existing Game Engine

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for an existing game engine (e.g., Unity, Godot) using a lightweight machine learning approach.  The AI will be designed for a specific, pre-defined mini-game within the engine, focusing on rapid prototyping and demonstrable improvement within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in exploring quick AI integration techniques and demonstrating practical application of reinforcement learning concepts without needing large datasets or extensive training times.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Game Engine:** Unity (preferred) or Godot (alternative).  Pre-existing project with a suitable mini-game environment is assumed (e.g., simple platformer level, maze navigation).
- **Programming Language:** C# (Unity) or GDScript (Godot).
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  Minimal external libraries; potentially a simple reinforcement learning library if time allows (e.g., a lightweight ML-Agents wrapper).

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic AI Movement:** The AI should navigate the mini-game environment autonomously, avoiding obstacles and reaching target locations.
- **Simple Decision-Making:**  AI should make basic decisions based on proximity to obstacles, targets, and other game elements.
- **Score Tracking & Improvement:** The AI should track its score (e.g., time to complete, points collected) and attempt to optimize its performance over multiple runs.
- **Visual Feedback:** The AI's actions and decisions should be visually clear in the game engine.
- **Configurable Parameters:**  Allow adjustment of key AI parameters (e.g., exploration vs. exploitation rate) to observe the impact on performance.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Opponent Adaptation:**  The AI could learn to counter simple player strategies if the mini-game involves interaction with a player.
- **Basic Pathfinding:** Implementing a simple pathfinding algorithm (A*, etc.) for improved navigation.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Select Mini-Game & Environment:**  Choose a suitable pre-existing mini-game or create a very simple one (e.g., navigating a maze to reach an exit).
2. **Implement Basic AI Movement:**  Create the fundamental AI controller using basic logic (e.g., random movement with obstacle avoidance).
3. **Integrate Score Tracking & Reinforcement Learning (Optional):**  If time allows, implement a simple reward system and a basic reinforcement learning approach (e.g., Q-learning) to improve performance.
4. **Test & Iterate:**  Run multiple trials, observe the AI's behavior, and adjust parameters for optimal performance.
5. **Visualize Results:** Create simple charts or graphs to display the AI's improvement over time.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Simplicity and Functionality:**  The AI should be simple enough to implement quickly but complex enough to be challenging.
- **Limited Training Time:**  The reinforcement learning (if used) might not converge fully within a short timeframe; focus on observing clear trends and improvements.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals (Optional):**  Practical experience with implementing a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Game AI Design & Development:**  Practical understanding of creating and integrating simple AI into a game environment.
