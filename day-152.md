# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking using a Webcam

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet functional real-time object detection and tracking system using a webcam.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and leveraging pre-trained models for efficient implementation within a short timeframe. This demonstrates practical application of computer vision and its integration with real-time video streams.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (for pre-trained model), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with sufficient processing power.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect pre-defined objects (e.g., people, cars) in the webcam feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected objects across frames, providing bounding boxes and potentially IDs for each object.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.
- **Output Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels directly on the webcam feed.
- **Basic UI:** A simple window to display the processed video.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Object counting (count the number of detected objects of a specific type).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Save the processed video to a file.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy). Download a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5).
2. **Load Model and Webcam:** Load the pre-trained model and initialize the webcam using OpenCV.
3. **Process Frames:**  Iterate through webcam frames, run object detection using the loaded model, and obtain bounding boxes and class labels.
4. **Track Objects:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's built-in tracker functions or a custom approach based on bounding box overlap).
5. **Display Results:** Draw bounding boxes, labels, and FPS on the frames and display them using OpenCV's window functions.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing can be computationally expensive depending on the model and webcam resolution.  Consider using a lighter-weight model or reducing the resolution if necessary.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracker might struggle with objects that are frequently occluded or disappear from view.  More sophisticated tracking algorithms can mitigate this, but might not be feasible within the timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of computer vision concepts like object detection and tracking.
- Gain practical experience integrating pre-trained models into a real-time application using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras.
