# Efficient Code Style Checker for Python

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a command-line tool that analyzes Python code for adherence to a specific style guide (e.g., PEP 8) and provides a concise report highlighting violations.  The tool prioritizes speed and efficiency, making it suitable for daily code review and quick style checks.  Significance lies in automating a crucial step in software development, improving code readability and maintainability.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees), `pycodestyle` (or `flake8`), `argparse`
- **Tools:**  A text editor/IDE (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), terminal/command prompt.


## Features & Requirements

- **Code Parsing & Analysis:**  The tool should parse Python code files, identifying style violations based on a chosen style guide (using `pycodestyle` or similar).
- **Violation Reporting:**  Generate a clear and concise report listing file names, line numbers, and descriptions of style violations.
- **Severity Levels:** Categorize violations into different severity levels (e.g., warning, error) based on their impact.
- **Output Formatting:**  Support different output formats like text, JSON, or XML for flexible integration into workflows.
- **Configurable Style Guide:** Allow users to specify a custom style guide or choose from pre-defined options.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Automated code fixing for minor style issues (e.g., whitespace, line length).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Integration with a version control system (e.g., Git) to highlight violations in changed files.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the project:** Create a new Python project directory, install necessary libraries (`pycodestyle`, `argparse`), and create the main script.
2. **Implement code parsing:** Use the `ast` module or `pycodestyle` to parse input Python files and identify style violations.
3. **Generate the report:**  Structure the report to include file name, line number, violation type, and severity level. Implement different output formatting options (text, JSON).
4. **Add command-line interface:** Use `argparse` to create a command-line interface for specifying input files, output format, and style guide.
5. **Test and refine:**  Thoroughly test the tool with various Python code examples, focusing on edge cases and handling of different file structures.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling large codebases:** Processing very large files efficiently may require optimization techniques like parallel processing or incremental analysis.  For a daily challenge, focus on efficient processing of reasonably sized files.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is essential to deal with invalid input files, unexpected exceptions during parsing, and incorrect user inputs.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of Python's `ast` module (or `pycodestyle`):**  This provides practical experience in working with the internal structure of Python code.
- **Improve skills in command-line tool development:**  Developing a command-line tool using `argparse` enhances the ability to create reusable and user-friendly command-line utilities.
