# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with WebRTC

## Overview
This project aims to build a real-time object tracking and classification system using WebRTC for video streaming and a lightweight machine learning model for object detection. This allows for remote monitoring and analysis, applicable to various scenarios such as security surveillance or industrial automation.  The focus is on rapid prototyping using pre-trained models and readily available APIs.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries listed below)
- **WebRTC:**  Using a JavaScript library (e.g., simple-peer) for client-side streaming.
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow Lite or a similar framework for on-device inference (a pre-trained model will be used).
- **Object Detection Model:**  A pre-trained MobileNet SSD or YOLOv5s model optimized for mobile/edge devices.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), NumPy, potentially Flask or FastAPI for a simple server.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  Transmit video from a source (webcam or IP camera) to a remote client using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Identify and classify objects within the video stream using the chosen pre-trained model.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Overlay bounding boxes and class labels on the video stream showing detected objects.
- **Object Tracking:** Track identified objects across frames (simple centroid tracking is sufficient).
- **FPS Monitoring:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.

- **Advanced Features:**  Integration with a cloud-based object storage for archiving detected objects, implementing a more sophisticated tracking algorithm (e.g., DeepSORT).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up WebRTC Streaming:** Establish a basic WebRTC connection between a client (browser) and a server using a chosen library.  The server will receive video stream data.
2. **Integrate Object Detection:** Load the pre-trained model and integrate it into the server-side code. Process received frames and perform object detection.
3. **Overlay Bounding Boxes:**  Use OpenCV to draw bounding boxes and labels on the processed frames. Send these annotated frames back to the client via the WebRTC connection.
4. **Implement Basic Tracking:** Employ a simple centroid-based tracker to follow objects across frames.
5. **Display FPS:** Measure and display the frames per second processed to evaluate performance and identify bottlenecks.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Latency:** WebRTC latency can impact the real-time aspect of the system. Choosing appropriate codecs and optimizing the system's processing are important.
- **Model Performance:**  The pre-trained model's accuracy and speed will affect the overall performance. Selecting a model appropriate for the chosen hardware and desired accuracy is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of real-time video processing using WebRTC and its challenges.
- Practical experience with integrating pre-trained machine learning models for real-time object detection and tracking.
