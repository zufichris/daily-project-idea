# Automated Code Style Enforcer with Real-Time Feedback

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time code style enforcer that provides immediate feedback to a developer as they type.  This tool will focus on a single style guideline (e.g., consistent indentation, maximum line length) and offer suggestions for improvement directly within the code editor.  This is significant because it helps developers maintain consistent code style throughout the project and reduces the need for manual code reviews for style-related issues.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with a suitable library for interacting with code editors, such as `lsp-server` or a specific editor plugin API)
- **Framework/Library:**  `Pygments` (for syntax highlighting),  `rope` or similar (for code parsing and manipulation).  Editor specific plugin SDK (e.g., VS Code extension API, Sublime Text plugin API).
- **Tools:** A code editor (VS Code recommended for ease of extension development), a version control system (Git).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time linting:** The tool should analyze code as it's being typed and immediately highlight style violations.
- **Suggestion Provision:**  It should suggest corrections or improvements for identified violations.  This could be a simple underline or a more sophisticated popup.
- **Configurable Rule Set:** Allow users to select which specific style guideline to enforce (e.g., indentation using spaces vs. tabs, maximum line length).
- **Severity Levels:** Allow users to define different severity levels for style violations (warning, error).
- **Error Reporting:** Provide clear and concise error messages indicating the nature of the style violation and its location in the code.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Auto-correction:** Automatically fix minor style violations (e.g., auto-indentation).
- **Integration with CI/CD:** Integrate the tool into a CI/CD pipeline to enforce style guidelines during the build process.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose a Style Guideline & Editor:** Select a single, well-defined style guideline (e.g., maximum line length of 80 characters) and the target code editor.
2. **Set up the Development Environment:**  Install necessary libraries and create a basic project structure. If using a VS Code extension, create a new extension project.
3. **Develop the Linting Engine:** Write a Python script (or extension) that parses the code, identifies violations of the chosen guideline, and provides feedback through highlighting or suggestions.
4. **Implement Feedback Mechanism:**  Integrate the linting engine with the selected code editor to display feedback to the user in real-time.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the functionality thoroughly and refine the feedback mechanisms for clarity and usability.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance:**  Real-time linting can be computationally expensive for large codebases.  Optimization techniques might be necessary to ensure responsiveness.
- **Editor Integration:** Integrating with different code editors requires learning their respective plugin APIs, which can add complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of code parsing and manipulation techniques.
- Practical experience in developing and integrating code editor extensions or plugins.
