# Automated Code Style Checker with Real-time Feedback

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple yet effective code style checker that provides real-time feedback to the developer as they type.  The focus is on speed and practicality, prioritizing a small subset of common style violations (e.g., line length, indentation) over exhaustive rule sets.  This enhances coding efficiency and consistency.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with a library like `pylint` or `flake8`) or JavaScript (with a library like `eslint`).
- **IDE/Editor:**  VS Code (with relevant extensions) or any text editor with plugin support.
- **Framework (Optional):**  A lightweight framework like Flask (Python) or Express.js (JavaScript) if adding a server-side component for real-time feedback.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Lint Check:** The tool will analyze code as it's being typed and highlight violations immediately within the editor.
- **Configurable Rules:** Allow users to customize the style rules (e.g., maximum line length, indentation style).
- **Clear Error Reporting:** Display informative error messages indicating the type and location of style violations.
- **Integration with Editor:** Seamlessly integrate with a code editor via extensions or plugins.
- **Basic Reporting (optional):** A simple summary of violations at the end of the coding session.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Auto-correction of simple style issues (e.g., fixing indentation).
- **Customizable Rule Sets (Optional):**  The ability to import and use custom style rule sets.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose a Language and Library:** Select either Python (with `pylint`/`flake8`) or JavaScript (`eslint`) based on preference and familiarity. Install the necessary library.
2. **Develop Core Functionality:** Implement the basic real-time linting functionality. This involves setting up event listeners (for key presses or file changes) and triggering the code analysis upon each change.
3. **Editor Integration:** Integrate with a code editor using extensions/plugins.  This will vary depending on the chosen editor and language.
4. **Error Reporting:** Design an effective way to display error messages. This might involve highlighting lines, displaying error messages in a separate panel, or using the editor's built-in error highlighting capabilities.
5. **(Optional) Server-Side Component:** If implementing real-time feedback using a server, set up the server and handle the communication between the client (editor) and the server.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance:** Real-time analysis can be computationally expensive for large files. Strategies like incremental parsing and asynchronous processing should be considered.
- **Editor Integration Complexity:** Integrating with different editors can be challenging and may require specific knowledge of their APIs or plugin systems.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Static Analysis Tools:** Gain hands-on experience in using and integrating static analysis tools for code quality improvement.
- **Real-time Feedback Mechanisms:** Learn how to design and implement systems that provide instant feedback to improve developer productivity and code quality.
