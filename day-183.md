# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling smart home devices using hand gestures recognized via a computer vision model.  The focus is on creating a functional, albeit limited, system that demonstrates the feasibility of gesture-based control within a short timeframe. This project showcases the integration of computer vision, machine learning, and smart home device control.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite (optional for model optimization),  requests (for API interaction)
- **Hardware:** Webcam or a compatible video source.  Access to a smart home device API (e.g., Philips Hue, IFTTT).
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE for Python development.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** The system must accurately recognize a predefined set of hand gestures (e.g., open hand, closed fist, thumbs up) from a webcam feed.
- **Smart Home Device Control Mapping:**  Each recognized gesture should trigger a specific action on a connected smart home device (e.g., turn on/off a light, adjust volume).
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple UI (possibly console-based) displaying recognized gestures and the corresponding actions.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle cases where gestures are not recognized or the smart home API is unavailable.
- **Calibration Option (Optional):** Allow users to calibrate the system to account for lighting conditions or individual hand sizes.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Multiple device control (control multiple lights or devices simultaneously with different gestures), gesture sequence recognition (e.g., two gestures to dim the lights).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Gesture Recognition Model Setup:**  Use MediaPipe's pre-trained hand tracking model to detect hand landmarks from the webcam feed.  This can be readily integrated into OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Classification:**  Develop a simple classification algorithm (e.g., using Euclidean distance or a basic machine learning model) to map hand landmark data to predefined gestures.
3. **Smart Home API Integration:** Integrate with a chosen smart home API to send commands based on the recognized gestures.  This involves using the requests library to make HTTP requests to the API.
4. **UI Development:** Create a basic console-based UI to display the recognized gestures and the triggered actions.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions.  Adjust the gesture classification thresholds or model parameters as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Lighting conditions, hand size variations, and background clutter can affect the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Addressing these might require more advanced techniques or model fine-tuning, which is beyond the scope of a daily challenge.
- **Smart Home API Limitations:** The chosen smart home API might have limitations on the types of commands or the rate of requests that can be made.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision techniques:**  This project strengthens the ability to use libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and model integration.
- **Gain experience in integrating different software components:**  This involves combining computer vision, machine learning, and external API interaction, highlighting software integration skills.
