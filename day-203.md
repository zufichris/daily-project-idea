# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection with intelligent traffic light control based on real-time vehicle detection. The simulation will focus on optimizing traffic flow by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on the number of vehicles waiting at each approach. This allows exploration of algorithms for traffic management without the complexities and safety concerns of real-world implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), potentially a simple queueing system library like `queue`
* **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), Python interpreter.

## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Simulation:**  Simulate vehicles arriving randomly at each approach to the intersection.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller that alternates between green, yellow, and red signals.
- **Vehicle Detection:** Simulate vehicle detection using a simple counter at each approach (no actual image processing required).
- **Dynamic Signal Timing:** Adjust the duration of green signals based on the number of detected vehicles at each approach.  Prioritize approaches with more vehicles.
- **Visualization:** Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light status using Pygame's graphical capabilities.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate different traffic light control algorithms (e.g., a simple adaptive algorithm).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Add pedestrian crossing simulation and control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create the Pygame window to display the intersection. Initialize variables for vehicle counts, traffic light timers, and vehicle generation rates.
2. **Vehicle Simulation:** Implement a function to generate vehicles randomly at each approach and move them through the intersection.
3. **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller with a fixed cycle initially.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Modify the traffic light controller to adjust the green light duration based on the number of vehicles detected at each approach. A simple proportional controller will suffice.
5. **Visualization Updates:**  Update the Pygame display to reflect the movement of vehicles and the state of the traffic lights.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Design:**  Designing an effective yet simple algorithm for dynamic signal timing within the time constraint is crucial.  A naive approach may lead to oscillations or inefficient traffic flow.
- **Balancing Real-Time and Accuracy:**  Finding a balance between realistic simulation behavior and the need for quick prototyping within the daily challenge timeframe requires careful selection of data structures and algorithm complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforces understanding of event-driven programming:**  Handling vehicle generation and traffic light changes requires managing asynchronous events.
- **Practical application of control theory concepts:**  Implementing a simple control algorithm to adjust traffic signals based on feedback (vehicle counts) provides practical experience with fundamental control system principles.
