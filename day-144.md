# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with YOLOv5

## Overview

This project aims to develop a lightweight, real-time object tracking and classification system using YOLOv5.  The goal is to demonstrate a functional prototype capable of identifying and tracking multiple objects within a video stream. This project is significant because it showcases practical applications of computer vision in areas like security surveillance, robotics navigation, and automated quality control.  A functional prototype can be built and tested within a day or two for a specific, constrained object set.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework:** PyTorch
* **Library:** YOLOv5 (pre-trained model or custom trained on a small dataset)
* **Tools:** OpenCV for video processing and visualization.  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect objects from a live video stream using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model.  Focus on a limited number of classes (e.g., person, car, bicycle).
- **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracker (e.g., using OpenCV's built-in trackers) to maintain object identity across frames.
- **Visualizations:** Display bounding boxes and class labels on the video stream in real-time.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display frames per second (FPS) to evaluate the system's speed.
- **Output:** Save the processed video with tracked objects.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a more robust tracking algorithm (e.g., DeepSORT) for improved accuracy in occlusions or fast movements.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Add a simple user interface for selecting the video source and object classes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv5). Download a pre-trained YOLOv5 model (or train a small dataset).
2. **Video Processing:**  Write code to read video frames from a source (camera or video file) using OpenCV.
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Integrate the YOLOv5 model to detect objects in each frame and use a suitable tracking algorithm to link detections across frames.
4. **Visualization and Output:** Draw bounding boxes, labels, and tracking IDs on the frames and save the processed video.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Measure and display the FPS.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** YOLOv5, while efficient, might be computationally demanding for low-powered devices. Consider using a smaller model or optimizing the code for improved performance.  Selecting a small dataset and limited classes mitigates this.
- **Accuracy of Tracking:** Simple trackers can struggle with occlusions or fast movements.  If the advanced feature is attempted, this will require extra time and expertise.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Deep Learning:**  Gain hands-on experience with applying a pre-trained deep learning model for real-world tasks.
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Reinforce concepts of object detection, tracking, and video processing.
