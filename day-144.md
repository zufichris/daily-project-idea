# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, self-balancing robotic arm using a microcontroller and a PID control algorithm. The goal is to create a system where the arm maintains a stable upright position despite external disturbances. This provides a practical demonstration of PID control, a crucial concept in robotics and automation.  The self-balancing aspect introduces a dynamic challenge within a manageable timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (for its integrated IMU) or similar.
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)
* **Sensors:**  Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) â€“ preferably integrated within the microcontroller or a separate MPU6050.
* **Actuator:** Servo motor (e.g., SG90)
* **Mechanical Components:** Lightweight materials (e.g., balsa wood or 3D-printed components) for the arm structure.


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain a vertical position despite minor disturbances.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A PID controller should be implemented to adjust the servo motor's position based on IMU feedback.
- **IMU Data Acquisition:** The program should accurately read and process data from the IMU.
- **Servo Motor Control:** Precise control of the servo motor's angle using PWM signals.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Visual feedback (e.g., serial monitor output) showing the arm's angle and PID controller adjustments.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementation of a simple Kalman filter to improve IMU data accuracy.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Adding a basic object detection capability (e.g., using a simple distance sensor) to allow the arm to react to nearby objects.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the robotic arm structure and connect the IMU and servo motor to the microcontroller.
2. **IMU Calibration and Data Acquisition:** Calibrate the IMU and write code to read and process its angular acceleration and angular velocity data.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement the PID control algorithm to calculate the required servo motor adjustments based on the IMU data.
4. **Servo Motor Control:**  Integrate the PID output to control the servo motor's position using PWM signals.
5. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the self-balancing functionality and fine-tune the PID controller gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal stability.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments. This necessitates understanding the impact of each gain (proportional, integral, derivative) on system stability and response.
- **IMU Noise:** IMU data can be noisy; filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter or Kalman filter) might be necessary to improve accuracy and stability.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** Deep understanding of PID control principles and its practical implementation in a dynamic system.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Improved skills in microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and actuator control within a real-time context.
