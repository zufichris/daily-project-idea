# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will identify a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within its field of view and track its movement, displaying the object's location on the screen. This project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision in a constrained environment and showcases efficient resource utilization on a low-power device.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Raspberry Pi:**  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (or equivalent)
- **Camera:**  Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 (or compatible)
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Framework (Optional):** TensorFlow Lite (for model optimization, if time permits)

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Real-time Display:** Display the camera feed with a bounding box around the tracked object.
- **Coordinates Output:** Output the object's x, y coordinates in real-time (e.g., to a console or file).
- **Frame Rate Monitoring:** Display the frames per second (FPS) achieved.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement object classification beyond simple color detection.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integrate with a motor control system for basic object following.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi and install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`).
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a simple color-based object detection algorithm using OpenCV's thresholding and contour detection functions.  Focus on detecting the pre-defined object.
3. **Object Tracking:**  Use OpenCV's `cv2.track()` function (or a similar tracking algorithm like CAMShift) to track the detected object across frames.
4. **Display and Output:** Display the camera feed with the bounding box and output the object's coordinates to the console.
5. **Optimization (Optional):** If time permits, explore using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for more robust object detection.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi has limited processing power.  Simple algorithms and efficient code are crucial for achieving real-time performance.  Careful consideration of image resolution is necessary.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of the color-based object detection.  Consider implementing adaptive thresholding or using a more robust object detection method if time allows.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of computer vision concepts, specifically object detection and tracking.
- Hands-on experience with OpenCV and its capabilities in real-time image processing on a resource-constrained platform.
