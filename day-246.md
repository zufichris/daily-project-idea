# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a system using a Raspberry Pi that detects and tracks a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in real-time using a camera. This demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts and real-time processing on a resource-constrained device.  The significance lies in its applicability to various fields like robotics, surveillance, and automated systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (with camera module), power supply
* **Software:** Raspberry Pi OS (with necessary dependencies installed)

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Maintain a frame rate of at least 10 FPS (frames per second).
- **Visual Output:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes around the detected object.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log the object's coordinates and timestamps to a file.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) on the Raspberry Pi and configure the camera module.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm using OpenCV's thresholding and contour detection functions to identify the target object.
3. **Object Tracking:** Utilize OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`, `cv2.TrackerKCF`) to track the detected object across consecutive frames.
4. **Real-time Display:** Display the processed video feed with bounding boxes around the tracked object using OpenCV's windowing functions.
5. **Data Logging (Optional):**  Write code to log the object's centroid coordinates and timestamps to a CSV file.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:**  Achieving real-time performance on a Raspberry Pi requires careful optimization of the code, possibly using techniques like image downscaling or region-of-interest processing.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  The robustness of color-based object detection can be affected by varying lighting conditions.  Consider adding techniques for handling this, such as adaptive thresholding.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:** Gain practical experience in processing video streams in real-time on a constrained platform.
- **Computer vision fundamentals:**  Reinforce understanding of object detection, tracking, and color-based image segmentation using OpenCV.
