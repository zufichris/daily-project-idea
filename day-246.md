# Real-time Object Tracking with OpenCV and a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and OpenCV.  The system will detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in a video stream from a connected camera and track its movement, displaying the object's location on the video feed. This is a valuable exercise in computer vision and embedded systems integration, applicable to various fields like robotics and surveillance.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB Webcam
- **Software:** Raspberry Pi OS (or similar), Python 3

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect a specific colored object (e.g., red ball) in the video stream.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid throughout the video.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object on the video feed.
- **Position Reporting:** Display the object's x, y coordinates (in pixels) on the screen.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process and display video frames at a reasonable frame rate (e.g., 10-20 fps).

- **Advanced Features:** Implementing Kalman filtering for smoother tracking.
- **Advanced Feature:** Adding object classification using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`) on the Raspberry Pi. Connect the webcam.
2. **Object Detection:** Write a function to detect the object using color thresholding (HSV color space) in OpenCV.
3. **Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay a bounding box and coordinates on the video feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Display:**  Display the processed video stream in a window.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variable lighting can affect color detection accuracy. Consider using adaptive thresholding or more robust color detection methods.
- **Object Occlusion:** If the object is temporarily occluded, the tracking might fail.  Exploring more advanced tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter) can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of OpenCV's image processing and video handling capabilities.
- Practical experience with real-time video processing on an embedded system.
