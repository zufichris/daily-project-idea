# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Mobile Robot Simulator

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simple, yet functional, real-time object detection and tracking system within a mobile robot simulator.  The goal is to demonstrate the integration of computer vision techniques with robotic control, allowing a simulated robot to autonomously navigate and interact with detected objects. This is significant as it provides a foundational understanding of critical elements in autonomous navigation systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, a suitable robotics simulator (e.g., Pygame, Gazebo (simpler simulation for a daily challenge), or a simplified custom simulator), potentially a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, pre-trained for object detection).
* **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), a terminal.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect a predefined set of objects (e.g., red balls, blue cubes) within the simulator's camera view using a pre-trained object detection model or simple color thresholding.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected objects' positions across consecutive frames.
- **Robot Navigation:** Implement basic robot control to move towards a detected object.
- **Distance Estimation:**  Estimate the distance to a detected object (optional use of depth information or simpler approaches based on camera parameters and object size).
- **Data Logging:** Log detected objects' positions and robot actions for analysis (optional).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Simulation:** Set up the chosen robotics simulator and create a simple simulated environment with the target objects.
2. **Object Detection:** Integrate the chosen object detection method (pre-trained model or color thresholding) and test its accuracy within the simulator.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using bounding boxes and Kalman filtering for smoother tracking).
4. **Robot Control:** Implement basic robot movement commands (e.g., move forward, turn) based on the tracked object's position.  This can be simplified using a predefined set of movements based on relative object position.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Combine all components and test the entire system's functionality.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Efficiency:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms and potentially optimization techniques if using a complex object detection model within a resource-constrained environment.  Consider simplifying the object detection aspect initially.
- **Simulator Limitations:** The fidelity and features of the chosen simulator might impact the project's complexity and realism.  Choosing a simple simulator streamlines the daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:** Gain practical experience in processing images and video streams in real-time.
- **Robot control and perception integration:** Understand the challenges and techniques involved in integrating computer vision with robot control for autonomous navigation.
