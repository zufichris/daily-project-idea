# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using hand gestures detected by a computer vision model.  The focus will be on creating a functional prototype with a minimal, yet intuitive, set of gestures. This demonstrates practical application of computer vision and smart home integration in a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  PyAutoGUI (for simulating keyboard/mouse input for appliance control), possibly a library for specific smart home integration (e.g., home-assistant-python)
* **Tools:** A webcam (or pre-recorded video for testing), a smart home appliance with API access (or a simulator), a Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., "on," "off," "brightness up/down").
- **Appliance Control:** The recognized gestures should trigger corresponding actions on the target smart home appliance (e.g., turning it on/off, adjusting brightness/speed).
- **Real-time Processing:** The system should process gestures and control the appliance with minimal latency.
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple graphical UI is desirable to display the recognized gesture and the appliance's status.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of unrecognized gestures and connection issues.

**Advanced Features:**
- **Calibration:** Allow users to calibrate the system to their specific hand gestures.
- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Extend to control multiple appliances with different gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries. Set up the webcam and potentially capture some sample gesture videos for training (optional, but speeds up development if pre-recorded data is used).
2. **Gesture Recognition Model Integration:** Integrate a pre-trained MediaPipe model for hand gesture recognition.  Focus on the essential 3-4 gestures initially.
3. **Appliance Control Implementation:**  Develop the logic to translate recognized gestures into control commands for the smart home appliance (using its API or simulating key presses/mouse clicks).
4. **UI Development:** Create a simple UI (e.g., using Tkinter or PyQt) to display the recognized gesture and appliance status.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system, refine gesture recognition accuracy, and improve the overall responsiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  The accuracy of gesture recognition might be affected by lighting conditions, hand position, or background clutter.  Consider using a simpler background for initial testing.
- **Smart Home API Integration:**  If integrating with a specific smart home API, understanding its documentation and authentication methods will be crucial.  A simulator is a good alternative for quicker progress.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time gesture recognition.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Learn how to integrate software with smart home devices or simulate such integrations using a readily available API or even mock commands.
