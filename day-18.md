# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view, displaying its location on a live video feed.  This serves as a practical application of computer vision and embedded systems, showcasing efficient image processing and object recognition techniques.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for model inference â€“ optional, can use simpler methods for a quicker prototype)
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (with a camera module), power supply
- **Tools:**  VS Code or similar IDE, SSH client (for remote access), potentially a Jupyter Notebook


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video stream from the Raspberry Pi camera.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the video stream.  Color-based detection is sufficient for a quick prototype.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.  A simple centroid tracking method can be used.
- **Visualization:** Display bounding boxes around the detected object on the live video feed.
- **Coordinate Output:** Output the object's (x,y) coordinates in real-time.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Use a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for more robust object classification (beyond simple color detection).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple user interface (e.g., using Tkinter) to adjust parameters like detection thresholds.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite if using) on the Raspberry Pi. Configure the camera.
2. **Video Capture and Preprocessing:** Write code to capture video frames from the camera and convert them to an appropriate format for processing (e.g., grayscale).
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Implement color-based object detection (e.g., thresholding) and a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking).
4. **Visualization and Output:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes around the detected object, and print the object's coordinates to the console.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with the target object and refine parameters (e.g., color thresholds, tracking sensitivity) to optimize performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Resources:**  The Raspberry Pi has limited processing power.  Complex object detection models might require optimization or simplification.  Simplifying the object detection method (e.g. colour-based instead of deep learning) is key for the one-day constraint.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can affect the accuracy of color-based object detection.  Consider adjusting thresholds dynamically or using more robust techniques if time allows.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of OpenCV:** Gain experience using OpenCV for real-time image processing, object detection, and tracking.
- **Embedded systems development:** Strengthen understanding of working with embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi) and integrating software for real-time applications.
