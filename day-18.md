# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Mobile Robot

## Overview

This project aims to develop and implement an optimized pathfinding algorithm for a simulated mobile robot navigating a dynamic obstacle environment. The significance lies in exploring efficient algorithms and their performance under real-time constraints, crucial for autonomous robot navigation.  This will use a simplified 2D environment for faster prototyping.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NetworkX (for graph representation), A* search algorithm implementation (can be found readily online or implemented from scratch).

## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot must successfully navigate around static and dynamic obstacles within the simulated environment.
- **Goal Reaching:** The robot should efficiently find and reach a designated target location.
- **Path Visualization:** The generated path should be visually represented in the Pygame window.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:**  The robot should adapt to new obstacles appearing in its path during navigation.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a path smoothing algorithm to reduce sharp turns and improve robot motion.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a different pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's) for comparison.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Introduce probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) for complex environments.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple Pygame window representing the 2D environment.  Populate it with static obstacles (pre-defined).
2. **A* Implementation:** Integrate or implement the A* pathfinding algorithm to generate a path from the robot's starting position to the goal.  Visualize the path.
3. **Dynamic Obstacle Integration:** Introduce moving obstacles.  Adapt the A* algorithm to re-plan the path when new obstacles appear. The robot may need to temporarily pause while replanning.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Measure the time taken for pathfinding and obstacle avoidance. Consider different heuristics for A* to optimize performance.
5. **Visualization Enhancements (Optional):** Add features like displaying the robot's trajectory, obstacle detection radius, and path cost.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:**  A* can be computationally expensive for large environments or many obstacles.  Consider heuristics and optimization techniques to maintain real-time performance.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:** Efficiently detecting and reacting to changing obstacle positions requires careful design of the re-planning strategy.  A simple solution might be to re-run A* at regular intervals or whenever a significant change is detected.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of pathfinding algorithms:** This project will solidify understanding of A* search and potentially other graph search algorithms, including their strengths, weaknesses, and implementation details.
- **Experience with real-time constraints:**  Developing and testing the algorithm in a simulated real-time environment helps understand the limitations of pathfinding algorithms and the importance of optimization for responsive robot control.
