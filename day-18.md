# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simplified self-balancing robotic arm controlled via a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The goal is to design and implement a control system that maintains the arm's balance despite external disturbances. This is a practical application of control theory, suitable for a short development cycle, and provides a tangible demonstration of PID tuning's effectiveness.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below)
- **Framework:**  No specific framework is required, but a well-structured codebase is important.
- **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID control implementation), Pygame (for simple visualization), and potentially a robotics simulator like PyBullet (optional, for faster iteration).
- **Hardware:** (Optional, depending on available resources) A small servo motor, an Arduino or similar microcontroller, and potentially a sensor (e.g., IMU).  Simulation is prioritized for a one- or two-day timeframe.

## Features & Requirements
- **Basic Balance:** The robotic arm (simulated or physical) should maintain an upright position.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A functional PID controller should be implemented to manage the servo motor's actions (or simulated equivalent).
- **Parameter Tuning:** The PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) should be tunable to adjust the controller's responsiveness and stability.
- **Real-time Feedback (optional for simulated version):** The arm's angle and angular velocity should be tracked and visualized in real-time.
- **Disturbance Rejection (advanced):**  The system should be tested with simulated or real disturbances (e.g., a small weight added to the arm).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Simulation Setup (if using):**  Set up a simple simulated robotic arm model in PyBullet or a similar simulator. Define the arm's dynamics and sensor model.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a PID controller in Python using NumPy/SciPy. Focus on a clear and modular design.
3. **Control Loop:** Create a control loop that reads the arm's angle and angular velocity (from simulation or sensors), calculates the control signal using the PID controller, and applies the signal to the simulated or physical servo motor.
4. **Parameter Tuning:**  Experiment with different PID gain values to find optimal settings for stability and responsiveness. Use a systematic approach (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system's performance with various disturbances or initial conditions. Iterate on the PID gains to achieve satisfactory performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Understanding the effects of each gain (Kp, Ki, Kd) is crucial.
- **Simulation vs. Reality:** If using physical hardware, there might be discrepancies between the simulated model and the real-world system. Careful calibration and sensor noise handling are necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of PID control principles:**  This project provides hands-on experience with designing, implementing, and tuning PID controllers.
- **Control system design:**  Understanding the interplay between system dynamics, sensor feedback, and control algorithms is crucial.  This project provides a practical context for these concepts.
