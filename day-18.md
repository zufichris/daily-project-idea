# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a micro-gesture recognition system controllable via a webcam feed. The system will translate small, subtle hand gestures into commands to control smart home devices (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume). This is a practical application of computer vision and machine learning focusing on speed and efficiency in development.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional - for on-device inference)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), Webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  Accurately identify predefined micro-gestures (e.g., flicking wrist up/down, subtle hand movements) from a webcam feed.
- **Command Mapping:** Map detected gestures to specific smart home commands (e.g., flick up = increase volume, flick down = decrease volume).
- **User Calibration:** Allow for user-specific gesture calibration to improve accuracy.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display detected gestures and corresponding commands on the screen.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where gestures are not clearly recognized.

**Advanced Features:**

- **On-Device Inference (Optional):** Deploy the model to a Raspberry Pi for local processing to reduce latency.
- **Multi-gesture Recognition:** Expand the system to recognize multiple concurrent gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture a small dataset of micro-gestures using the webcam.  Preprocess the images (resizing, normalization).
2. **Model Training (Simplified):** Use a pre-trained model from MediaPipe for pose estimation.  Develop a simple classification model (e.g., a k-NN classifier or a small, lightweight neural network) to map poses to gestures.
3. **Gesture Recognition Pipeline:** Integrate the pose estimation and classification models into a real-time pipeline using OpenCV.
4. **Command Integration:** Implement the mapping between recognized gestures and smart home commands. Simulate smart home control via print statements.
5. **User Interface (Basic):** Create a simple visual interface (using OpenCV's windowing capabilities) to display the detected gestures and executed commands.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Small, subtle gestures can be difficult to detect accurately, especially with variations in lighting and hand positions.  Careful data acquisition and model selection are crucial.
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms and potentially hardware acceleration (if using a more complex model).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Gain hands-on experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and pose estimation.
- **Machine Learning for Classification:**  Develop a basic understanding of using machine learning algorithms for simple classification tasks.
