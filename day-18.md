#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using computer vision.  The goal is to create a system that allows the drone to autonomously navigate a small obstacle course, demonstrating basic computer vision and drone control integration within a limited timeframe.  This project is significant as it showcases fundamental concepts applicable to more complex autonomous navigation systems.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision),  a drone control library (e.g., DroneKit-Python for DJI drones, or a simulator like AirSim), NumPy
- **Hardware:** A miniature drone (e.g., DJI Tello, or a simulator), a laptop/computer with a webcam (optional, if using a simulator)


## Features & Requirements
- **Obstacle Detection:**  The system should detect obstacles (e.g., simple objects like boxes or cones) in front of the drone using a camera feed.
- **Distance Estimation:**  The system should estimate the distance to detected obstacles using image processing techniques.
- **Avoidance Maneuver:** The drone should perform a basic avoidance maneuver (e.g., turning or ascending) when an obstacle is detected within a pre-defined threshold distance.
- **Basic Flight Control:**  The system should provide basic flight control commands (takeoff, landing, movement) using the chosen drone control library.
- **Real-time Processing:** The entire pipeline, from image capture to drone control, should operate in real-time.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated avoidance algorithm (e.g., path planning using A* or similar).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Use depth sensing (e.g., a depth camera) for more accurate distance estimation.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Calibration:** Install necessary libraries, connect to the drone (or simulator), and calibrate the camera if necessary.
2. **Obstacle Detection:** Implement an obstacle detection algorithm using OpenCV.  Start with simple color thresholding or edge detection for rapid prototyping.
3. **Distance Estimation:** Implement a simple distance estimation technique (e.g., assuming a known object size and using perspective transformations).
4. **Control Integration:** Integrate the obstacle detection and distance estimation with the drone control library to trigger avoidance maneuvers based on detected obstacles.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system on a small obstacle course and refine the parameters (e.g., distance thresholds, avoidance maneuver parameters) as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:**  Real-time processing on a miniature drone's onboard computer can be challenging.  Simplifying the algorithms and optimizing code for speed is crucial.
- **Accuracy of Distance Estimation:** Simple distance estimation methods can be inaccurate. This may necessitate experimenting with different techniques or accepting a margin of error in obstacle avoidance.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  This project provides hands-on experience with fundamental computer vision techniques like object detection and distance estimation in a real-world context.
- **Robotics and Embedded Systems Integration:**  This project reinforces the concepts of integrating computer vision with robotic control systems and managing real-time constraints.
