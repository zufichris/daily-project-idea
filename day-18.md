# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with a Robotic Arm (Simplified)

## Overview
This project aims to build a simplified system for real-time object detection and tracking using a pre-trained model and a robotic arm simulator.  The focus is on integrating a computer vision component with robotic control, demonstrating a fundamental concept in robotics and automation.  The objective is not to build a fully functional robotic system but to create a functional prototype showcasing the core integration logic within the timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (pre-trained object detection model - e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNet SSD), PyBullet (robotic arm simulator)
- **Hardware:** (Optional) A physical robotic arm (requires significant setup time, not recommended for a daily challenge)
- **Software:**  A suitable IDE (PyCharm, VS Code)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in a live video stream using a pre-trained model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across the video frames.
- **Robotic Arm Control (Simulated):**  Send commands to a simulated robotic arm (PyBullet) to move the end-effector (gripper) towards the tracked object's location.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Implement simple error handling for object detection failures.
- **GUI (Optional):**  Display the video stream with bounding boxes around detected objects and arm simulation visualization.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm to account for arm kinematics and avoid collisions.  Add a gripper control mechanism to simulate grasping the object.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, PyBullet). Download a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Integrate the object detection model with OpenCV to process the video stream and track the detected object's centroid coordinates.
3. **Robotic Arm Simulation:** Set up a simple robotic arm model in PyBullet.  This should include basic joint control.
4. **Integration:**  Connect the object tracking data to the robotic arm simulation.  Translate the object's coordinates into commands to move the arm.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with a video stream and adjust parameters (e.g., model threshold, arm movement speed) as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Performance:** Real-time processing of video and robotic control might be computationally intensive.  Consider using optimized models and techniques for faster inference.  Simplifying the robotic arm model can also help.
- **Coordinate System Transformation:**  Converting image coordinates (pixels) to robotic arm coordinates (e.g., joint angles) can be challenging.  A simple linear transformation may suffice for this simplified project.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Integration of Computer Vision and Robotics:** This project reinforces the practical application of computer vision algorithms in robotics control systems.
- **Real-time System Design:**  Experience in designing and implementing a real-time system that requires coordination between different software components.
