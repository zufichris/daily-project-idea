# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Mobile Robot using OpenCV

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, yet effective, real-time object detection and tracking system for a simulated or physical mobile robot using OpenCV. The goal is to enable the robot to identify and follow a specific object (e.g., a colored ball) within its field of view.  This demonstrates fundamental computer vision and robotics integration skills.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Framework (Optional):** ROS (Robot Operating System) for robot control (if using a physical robot)
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi with camera, or simulated robot environment (Gazebo, V-REP).


## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using color thresholding or a more advanced method like Haar cascades or YOLO (simplified version).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across frames using techniques like Kalman filtering or simple frame-to-frame comparison.
- **Robot Control (Optional):**  If using a physical robot, integrate the object tracking data to control the robot's movement towards the object.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the camera feed with detected and tracked objects highlighted.
- **Performance Measurement:** Measure the frames per second (FPS) to evaluate the system's performance.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more robust object tracking algorithm capable of handling occlusions.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate a depth sensor (e.g., Kinect) to estimate distance to the object.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) and connect to the camera (real or simulated).
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm.  If time allows, explore more advanced methods.
3. **Object Tracking:**  Implement a simple tracking algorithm to follow the detected object's centroid.
4. **(Optional) Robot Control:** Integrate the tracking data to control the robot's motors (if using a physical robot).  This step might involve using ROS or a specific robot control library.
5. **Visual Feedback & Performance Measurement:** Display the results and calculate FPS.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally expensive.  Optimizing the code and potentially using hardware acceleration is crucial.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of color-based object detection.


## Learning Outcomes
- This project reinforces practical skills in image processing, object detection, and tracking using OpenCV.
- It helps understand the fundamentals of integrating computer vision with robotics, specifically for real-time control applications.
