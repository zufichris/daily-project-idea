#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration & Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified calibration and control system for a miniature robotic arm (e.g., a 3-DOF robotic arm kit). The goal is to create a basic, yet functional, control interface allowing precise positioning of the arm's end-effector. This is a practical exercise in robotics that blends hardware and software control.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PySerial (for serial communication), NumPy (for numerical computation), possibly a real-time control library (e.g., `RPi.GPIO` if using a Raspberry Pi).
- **Hardware:** A 3-DOF robotic arm kit (e.g., from Adafruit, SparkFun), a microcontroller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), and a computer for control.
- **Software:** A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Serial Communication:** Establish reliable serial communication between the microcontroller and the computer.
- **Motor Control:** Implement functions to control the individual motors of the robotic arm using pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals.
- **Calibration Routine:** Develop a simple calibration procedure to determine the relationship between PWM values and angular displacement for each motor.
- **Basic Control Interface:** Create a Python script with a basic interface (command-line or simple GUI) to send commands to control the arm's position.
- **Position Reporting:** Implement feedback mechanism to display the current position or angles of the robotic arm.

- **Advanced Features:**  Add inverse kinematics calculation for direct Cartesian coordinate control (optional). Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup & Serial Connection:** Connect the robotic arm to the microcontroller and establish serial communication between the microcontroller and the computer. Test serial communication using a simple send/receive test.
2. **Motor Control Functions:** Write Python functions to send PWM signals to each motor, controlling their speed and direction. Test individual motor control.
3. **Calibration:** Develop a manual calibration routine.  Move each motor to known positions and record the corresponding PWM values. Create a calibration table or mapping function.
4. **Control Interface:** Create a simple control interface (e.g., command-line) that allows the user to input desired motor angles or PWM values.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate all components, calibrate, and test the system.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Calibration Accuracy:** Achieving precise calibration might be challenging due to mechanical tolerances in the robotic arm. Iterative refinement of the calibration procedure might be necessary.
- **Real-time Control:** Maintaining real-time control, particularly with a basic approach, may require careful attention to timing and communication overhead.  Prioritizing tasks and optimizing code is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Interaction:** Gain practical experience in interfacing with embedded systems (microcontrollers) and programming real-time control.
- **Calibration Techniques:** Learn about the importance of calibration in robotics and develop skills in creating and applying calibration routines.
