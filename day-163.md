# Efficient Image Processing Pipeline for Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a streamlined image processing pipeline for robot navigation, focusing on obstacle detection and path planning in a constrained environment.  The pipeline will process images from a simulated or real-world camera feed, quickly identify obstacles, and provide basic path planning suggestions.  This is crucial for autonomous navigation systems where efficient processing is vital.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, SciPy (optional for advanced path planning)
- **Framework:**  No specific framework required, but a modular design is recommended.
- **Tools:**  A simulator like Gazebo (optional, for testing with a simulated robot) or access to a robot with a camera.


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition:**  Capture images from a camera feed (simulated or real).
- **Obstacle Detection:** Implement a robust algorithm to identify obstacles (e.g., using color thresholding, edge detection, or a pre-trained model).
- **Path Planning (Basic):** Generate a simple path avoiding detected obstacles (e.g., a basic A* algorithm or a simpler approach like following walls).
- **Visualization:** Display the original image, detected obstacles, and the planned path.
- **Performance Measurement:**  Measure processing time for each stage of the pipeline.


- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a more sophisticated path planning algorithm (e.g., RRT*).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate with a robot simulator or real robot for autonomous navigation testing.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Image Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Set up image acquisition from the camera source. Perform basic preprocessing steps like noise reduction and color space conversion (if necessary).
2. **Obstacle Detection:** Implement the chosen obstacle detection algorithm. This might involve thresholding, edge detection (Canny), or a simpler approach depending on the environment.
3. **Path Planning:** Implement a basic path planning algorithm (e.g., A*, following walls) based on the detected obstacles and the robot's current position and goal.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay the detected obstacles and the planned path on the original image using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Measure and record the processing time for each step, identifying potential bottlenecks.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robust Obstacle Detection:**  Developing an algorithm that reliably identifies obstacles in varying lighting conditions and with different object types can be challenging. Experiment with different techniques to find the optimal approach for the specific environment.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Ensuring the pipeline runs efficiently enough for real-time performance is crucial. Optimization techniques might be necessary to reduce processing time.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Image Processing Techniques:**  Reinforces understanding and practical application of fundamental image processing techniques like thresholding, edge detection, and color space transformations.
- **Autonomous Navigation Fundamentals:** Gains experience in developing a simplified autonomous navigation system, including obstacle avoidance and basic path planning.
