# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to create a small-scale, self-balancing robotic arm using a microcontroller and sensor feedback. The arm will maintain its upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating fundamental control system principles. This is a scaled-down version that can be prototyped and tested within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (for built-in IMU) or similar.
* **Sensors:**  MPU6050 (IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit) for acceleration and angular velocity.
* **Actuators:** Two small hobby servo motors (for arm joints).
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Libraries:**  MPU6050 library, Servo library.
* **Tools:** Soldering iron, breadboard, jumper wires, 3D printed or laser-cut arm structure (optional, can use simple construction).


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm maintains an upright position using feedback from the IMU.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is used to regulate the servo motors' positions.
- **Calibration Routine:** Allows for easy calibration of the IMU and servo motors.
- **Basic Movement Control (Optional):**  Allows for limited control of the arm's position within its balancing range (e.g., slight tilt).
- **Data Logging (Advanced):** Records sensor data and control output for analysis and tuning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU and servos to the microcontroller.  Test individual servo and sensor functionality.
2. **IMU Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Write code to read IMU data (angles and angular velocity). Implement a simple calibration routine to account for sensor biases.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Develop a basic PID controller to maintain a zero angle. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) experimentally.
4. **Servo Control Loop:** Integrate the PID controller output to drive the servo motors to counteract deviations from the upright position.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the self-balancing functionality. Refine PID gains for optimal performance and robustness against disturbances.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains requires iterative testing and adjustment.  Improper tuning can lead to oscillations or instability.
- **Sensor Noise:** The IMU may introduce noise into the system, requiring filtering or smoothing techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce PID Control Concepts:**  Gain practical experience in designing and implementing a PID controller.
- **Develop Embedded Systems Skills:**  Improve skills in microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and actuator control.
