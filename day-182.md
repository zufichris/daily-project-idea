# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a traffic light system that dynamically adjusts its timing based on real-time vehicle density detected by simulated sensors.  The goal is to minimize average wait times and optimize traffic flow, showcasing a simplified version of intelligent traffic management systems.  This is a reduced-scope project focusing on core algorithmic optimization, suitable for a daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python:** For simulation logic and data processing.
- **NumPy:** For efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib (optional):** For visualization of traffic flow and wait times.
- **Pygame (optional):** For a simple graphical user interface.


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Simulate vehicles randomly appearing at different entry points with varying speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller with configurable cycle times.
- **Density Sensor Simulation:**  Simulate sensors that detect vehicle density at specific points.
- **Adaptive Timing:** Adjust traffic light timings based on detected vehicle density, prioritizing roads with higher traffic.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display average wait times and throughput.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement different traffic light control algorithms (e.g., a simple proportional controller).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a "pedestrian" element to the simulation, integrating pedestrian crossing signals with adaptive logic.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Simulation Setup:** Create functions to generate vehicles, move them, and simulate basic traffic light cycling.
2. **Density Sensor Implementation:**  Add code to simulate density sensors and calculate vehicle density at key points.
3. **Adaptive Control Algorithm:** Develop a simple algorithm (e.g., threshold-based) to adjust traffic light timings based on sensor readings.
4. **Performance Metrics Calculation:** Implement functions to calculate average wait times and throughput.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If time allows, use Matplotlib or Pygame to visualize the simulation and the performance metrics.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Design:** Designing an efficient and effective adaptive control algorithm within the time constraints is crucial.  Starting with a simple threshold-based approach and iterating is recommended.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** Balancing simulation complexity with achievable daily progress requires careful consideration.  Focus on core functionality over detailed realism.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithm Design and Implementation:** This project reinforces skills in designing and implementing control algorithms for dynamic systems.
- **Simulation and Modeling:** The project provides hands-on experience in building and analyzing simulations, a crucial skill for many software engineering and robotics applications.
