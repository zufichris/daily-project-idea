# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robotic Object Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple yet effective AI-powered image captioning system integrated with a simulated robotic arm environment. The goal is to enhance object recognition capabilities of the robot by generating descriptive captions for images captured by its camera. This improves the robot's understanding of its surroundings and enables more nuanced interaction with objects. This project uses a pre-trained model to ensure feasibility within the short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), Transformers (for image captioning using a pre-trained model like CLIP or a similar smaller model), PyBullet (for robot simulation).
- **Tools:**  A Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE.  Access to a reasonable computational resource (laptop or cloud compute). Pre-trained model download will be required.


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition & Preprocessing:** The system should capture an image from a simulated camera attached to the robotic arm. Basic preprocessing (resizing, normalization) should be performed.
- **Caption Generation:** Utilize a pre-trained image captioning model to generate a textual description of the image.
- **Object Identification:** Based on the generated caption, identify key objects present in the scene.  A simple keyword matching approach can be used initially.
- **Robot Arm Interaction (Simulated):**  The robot arm should be commanded to interact with a specific identified object (e.g., pick up a cube).
- **Output Display:** Display the original image, the generated caption, and the robot's action (or planned action) on the screen.


- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated object identification system using more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., named entity recognition).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate a more realistic robot simulation environment with more complex interactions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained image captioning model. Set up a basic PyBullet simulation with a robotic arm and objects.
2. **Image Capture & Preprocessing:** Write code to capture an image from the simulated camera and perform basic preprocessing.
3. **Caption Generation & Object Identification:** Integrate the pre-trained model to generate a caption and implement a simple keyword-based object identification system.
4. **Robot Arm Control:** Develop the logic to command the robot arm to interact with the identified object based on the caption.
5. **Output & Visualization:** Display the results (image, caption, robot action) in a clear and informative manner.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model that balances accuracy with computational cost is crucial within the time constraint.  Consider smaller, faster models.
- **Robustness:** The object identification system might be sensitive to variations in image quality or caption accuracy.  Error handling and fallback mechanisms should be considered.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Pre-trained Models:** Gain hands-on experience integrating and utilizing pre-trained deep learning models for a real-world task.
- **Robotics Simulation & Control:**  Develop skills in controlling simulated robotic arms and integrating vision systems within a robotics pipeline.
