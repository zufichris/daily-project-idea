# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning. The goal is to build a functional AI opponent that learns optimal strategies through self-play within a limited timeframe. This provides a practical application of reinforcement learning concepts in a readily understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `gym` (for environment creation, optional), `numpy`, `matplotlib` (for visualization, optional), a reinforcement learning library like `stable-baselines3` or a simpler custom implementation.

## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:** Implement a functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) with clear win/lose/draw conditions.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Develop a basic reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA) to play the game.
- **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop where the agent plays against itself repeatedly, learning from its experiences.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Measure the agent's win rate against a simple random player.
- **Basic Visualization (Optional):**  Visualize the agent's learning progress (e.g., win rate over time).

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network â€“ DQN, if time permits).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Incorporate an exploration-exploitation strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to improve learning efficiency.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game rules, board representation, and reward structure within the chosen framework.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on its learned policy.
3. **Training Loop Development:** Create a loop where the agent plays multiple games against itself, updating its policy based on the rewards received.
4. **Evaluation and Refinement:** Evaluate the agent's performance against a random player and iterate on the algorithm or hyperparameters to improve its win rate.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  If time allows, plot the learning curve to visualize the agent's progress.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm that balances complexity and achievable results within the time constraint.  A simpler algorithm like Q-learning is recommended for a single-day project.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the chosen algorithm may require experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts like Q-learning or SARSA.
- Experience in developing and training a simple AI agent.
- Improved understanding of agent-environment interaction and reward systems in reinforcement learning.
