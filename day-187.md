# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice and Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp, fan, or thermostat) using a combination of voice commands and hand gestures. This combines two popular interaction methods, offering a flexible and intuitive control interface beyond typical app-based methods. The focus will be on a minimal viable product (MVP) that demonstrates core functionality.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyAudio (audio input), TensorFlow Lite (for gesture recognition - pre-trained model), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text),  a suitable library for controlling the target appliance (e.g., home automation API).
- **Hardware:** A Raspberry Pi (or similar single-board computer), a USB microphone, and a camera (optional, depending on gesture recognition method).
- **Software:** A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, Thonny)


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Accept voice commands (e.g., "Turn on the lamp," "Set fan to high") and execute corresponding actions.
- **Gesture Control:** Recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, hand raise for brightness increase) using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model (simpler implementation possible if camera is unavailable).
- **Appliance Integration:**  Successfully control a chosen smart home appliance via its API or direct connection.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle invalid voice commands or unrecognized gestures.
- **Basic UI:** A simple terminal-based or GUI interface for monitoring the system's status and configuration.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a user authentication mechanism. Incorporate natural language processing (NLP) for more complex voice commands.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries, configure the Raspberry Pi (or chosen computer), and connect the microphone (and camera if needed).
2. **Implement Voice Recognition:** Integrate SpeechRecognition to process audio input, convert it to text, and parse commands.
3. **Implement Gesture Recognition (if applicable):** Integrate a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for basic gesture detection.  If a camera is unavailable, the project can skip this step focusing solely on voice commands.
4. **Appliance Integration:** Establish communication with the target smart home appliance, using its API or direct connection if it supports this.
5. **Combine and Test:**  Integrate voice and gesture recognition with the appliance control, thoroughly test, and refine error handling.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition and Gesture Recognition:**  Environmental noise, variations in voice and gesture execution can impact accuracy.  Consider incorporating error correction methods or fallback mechanisms.
- **Appliance API Compatibility:** Different smart home appliances may have different APIs. Choose an appliance with well-documented APIs for easier integration.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of skills in Python programming, including library integration and efficient code structuring.
- Practical experience with real-time audio and/or video processing and machine learning model deployment.
