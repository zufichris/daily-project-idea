# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition.  This provides a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional control methods, showcasing the integration of computer vision and IoT technologies. The focus will be on a functional prototype, demonstrating core functionality rather than a polished user interface.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking),  SocketIO (communication with appliance),  (Example Appliance API - depends on chosen appliance)
- **Hardware:** Webcam (or integrated laptop camera), Smart Home appliance with API access (e.g., Philips Hue, a controllable smart fan via a NodeMCU)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Detection:** Accurate detection of hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognition of predefined gestures (e.g., open hand for ON, closed fist for OFF, waving hand for brightness/speed adjustment).
- **Appliance Control:** Sending commands to the target smart appliance based on recognized gestures.
- **Calibration:**  A simple calibration process to adjust sensitivity and hand positioning.
- **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of scenarios where hand detection fails or gestures are unclear.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Appliance Control:** Extend the system to control multiple appliances using different gestures.
- **User Profile:**  Store individual user calibrations for improved accuracy.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Calibration:** Install necessary libraries, connect to the smart appliance API, and perform a basic camera calibration to optimize hand detection.
2. **Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition:** Implement real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe and define a simple logic for gesture recognition (e.g., based on finger positions).
3. **Appliance Control Integration:** Integrate the gesture recognition output with the smart appliance API to send control commands (e.g., ON/OFF, brightness level).
4. **Refinement & Testing:** Test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions. Refine gesture recognition logic for improved accuracy.
5. **Presentation:** Create a short demonstration video showing the functional prototype.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Hand detection accuracy can be affected by varying lighting conditions. Consider implementing techniques to mitigate this (e.g., image preprocessing).
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Distinguishing between similar gestures might require more sophisticated algorithms or a larger training dataset (if using machine learning based gesture recognition).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Hands-on experience with real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **IoT Integration:** Experience with integrating computer vision systems with smart home appliances using APIs.
