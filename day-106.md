# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a quick calibration procedure for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately determine the robot's end-effector pose (position and orientation) in 3D space without relying on complex, pre-programmed calibration routines. This simplifies setup and allows for rapid deployment in various environments.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot Magician, UR5e - simulation acceptable)
- A calibrated camera (or simulated camera feed)
- A checkerboard pattern (physical or digital)

## Features & Requirements
- **Automatic Checkerboard Detection:**  The system should automatically detect and locate the checkerboard pattern in the camera image.
- **Pose Estimation:**  Using the detected checkerboard, estimate the 3D pose of the checkerboard relative to the camera.
- **Robot Arm Movement Control:**  Send commands to the robot arm to move to a specific location based on the checkerboard pose.
- **Calibration Routine:**  The system should execute a sequence of movements allowing for precise calibration of the robot's arm.
- **Error Reporting:**  The system should provide feedback on the accuracy of the calibration process.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement a visual feedback mechanism displaying the estimated pose and calibration progress.
- **Optional Feature:**  Integrate with a ROS (Robot Operating System) environment for more robust control and integration.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture images from the camera and use OpenCV to detect the checkerboard pattern.  Calculate the camera's intrinsic parameters (if not already known).
2. **Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to estimate the pose of the checkerboard in the camera's coordinate system.
3. **Robot Arm Control:**  Use the robotic arm's API or ROS interface to send commands based on the calculated checkerboard pose.  The commands should move the robot arm to a specific point relative to the checkerboard.
4. **Calibration Loop:** Iterate steps 1-3 multiple times, refining the robot's position based on the observed discrepancies between the expected and actual checkerboard position.
5. **Error Analysis and Reporting:**  Evaluate the accuracy of the calibration by analyzing the residual errors between expected and observed positions.  Display results visually or numerically.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Camera Calibration Accuracy:** Inaccurate camera calibration will directly affect the accuracy of the pose estimation and calibration results.
- **Robot Arm Precision:** The precision of the robot arm itself will limit the accuracy achievable through this calibration method.  Dealing with robot arm inaccuracies is key.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with computer vision techniques for pose estimation.
- Understanding of robotic arm kinematics and control principles.  Specifically, how to bridge the gap between vision and robotic control.
