# Minimalist Robotic Arm Trajectory Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified trajectory planning algorithm for a robotic arm, optimizing for speed and smoothness while avoiding self-collisions.  The goal is to create a system that can generate efficient movement paths for a simulated 2-DOF robotic arm given a set of target waypoints.  This is significant as efficient trajectory planning is crucial for robotic automation and requires complex mathematical modelling, but a simplified version can be prototyped quickly to demonstrate core concepts.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, possibly SciPy for optimization (optional)


## Features & Requirements

- **Waypoint Input:** The system should accept a list of (x, y) coordinates representing desired target positions for the robotic arm's end effector.
- **Trajectory Generation:** Generate a smooth trajectory connecting the waypoints, considering joint angle limits.  A simple linear interpolation with smoothing can suffice for this daily challenge.
- **Collision Detection (Simplified):** Implement basic self-collision detection for the two links of the arm (consider only intersecting line segments).
- **Visualization:**  Display the robotic arm's movement and the generated trajectory using Matplotlib.
- **Performance Metric:** Calculate the total time taken for the arm to complete the trajectory.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated trajectory optimization algorithm using SciPy's optimization functions (e.g., minimizing total path length or maximizing speed while maintaining smoothness).
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Incorporate a simple obstacle avoidance mechanism.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and define the robotic arm's kinematic model (link lengths and joint limits).
2. **Waypoint Input and Linear Interpolation:** Implement a function to take waypoint inputs and generate a basic linear interpolation between them.
3. **Collision Detection:** Create a function to check for self-collision between the robotic arm's links.  Simple line segment intersection checks are sufficient for a 2-DOF arm.
4. **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib to visually represent the robot arm's movements based on the generated trajectory.
5. **Trajectory Smoothing (Optional):**  If time allows, implement smoothing algorithms like moving averages or cubic splines to improve the trajectory's smoothness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Collision Detection Complexity:**  While simplified, implementing even basic collision detection can be tricky.  Careful consideration of geometry and intersection calculations is needed.
- **Trajectory Optimization Complexity (Optional):** If attempting advanced optimization, finding suitable optimization algorithms and parameters may require research and experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of robotic kinematics:** This project provides hands-on experience with basic robotic arm kinematics, including forward and inverse kinematics (implicitly through trajectory generation).
- **Practice algorithm design and implementation:**  Designing and implementing the trajectory generation and collision detection algorithms will hone algorithm design and implementation skills.
