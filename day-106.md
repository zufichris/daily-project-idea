# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, wave) and trigger corresponding actions, such as turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or pausing/playing media.  This offers a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional voice or touch-based interfaces, focusing on speed and ease of use.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation), PyAutoGUI (for screen control)
- **Hardware:** Webcam (integrated or external)
- **Optional:** A small, inexpensive microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) for direct hardware control (advanced feature).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:** The system should accurately identify predefined hand gestures from the webcam feed in real-time.
- **Action Mapping:**  Each gesture should be mapped to a specific smart home action (e.g., thumbs up = lights on).
- **User Calibration:** The system should allow for quick calibration to adapt to different lighting conditions and user variations.
- **GUI (Optional):** A simple graphical user interface to display recognized gestures and manage action mappings.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling for scenarios like poor lighting or unclear gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, configure the webcam, and capture a small dataset of example images for each gesture (using OpenCV).
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., a Support Vector Machine or a simple neural network) using the captured data to classify gestures.  Focus on speed and accuracy within the available time.  MediaPipe's pose estimation can simplify feature extraction.
3. **Action Triggering:** Implement the logic to trigger corresponding actions based on the recognized gesture using PyAutoGUI (for screen control) or direct communication with a microcontroller (for advanced feature).
4. **GUI Development (Optional):** Create a basic GUI to display the recognized gesture and allow users to modify gesture-action mappings.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system and refine the model or parameters for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy and Robustness:** Achieving high accuracy and robustness in gesture recognition across varying lighting conditions and individual hand sizes can be challenging within the short timeframe.  Simplifying the gestures and focusing on a small, well-defined dataset will help.
- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing accuracy and speed to maintain real-time performance can be tricky.  Optimizing code and choosing efficient algorithms are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on Experience with Computer Vision:** This project provides practical experience in applying computer vision techniques for real-world problems, specifically in gesture recognition.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** It reinforces the process of training, evaluating, and refining machine learning models for a specific task.
