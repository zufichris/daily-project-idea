# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to create an AI that can learn and improve its strategy within a short timeframe, showcasing the power of reinforcement learning algorithms in a concise application.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, optional), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning model), NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -   A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -   A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., using Q-learning or SARSA).
    -   Training loop allowing the AI to play against itself and learn.
    -   A simple visualization of the game state and AI's moves.
    -   Performance metrics (e.g., win rate against a random player).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -   Implementing a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    -   Adding a human-playable mode against the AI.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Create a game environment using a library like OpenAI Gym or implement a basic game logic from scratch in Python.
2. **Design the reinforcement learning agent:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point) and implement it.  Define the state space, action space, reward function, and learning parameters.
3. **Implement the training loop:**  Create a loop where the agent plays numerous games against itself, updates its policy based on the rewards received, and tracks its performance.
4. **Visualize and evaluate:** Develop a simple visualization of the game and plot performance metrics (win rate, average reward) over time.
5. **Refine (optional):** If time permits, explore more sophisticated algorithms or add the advanced features (human player interaction).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward function design:**  A well-designed reward function is crucial for effective learning.  It needs to incentivize winning behavior while discouraging suboptimal moves.
- **Exploration-exploitation trade-off:**  Balancing exploration (trying new moves) and exploitation (using the best known moves) is critical for efficient learning.  This might require adjusting exploration parameters during training.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement learning concepts:**  Practical application of a reinforcement learning algorithm, understanding state space, action space, reward functions, and policy updates.
- **Python programming:**  Reinforcing Python programming skills by implementing game logic, AI algorithms, and visualizations.
