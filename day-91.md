# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice and Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures.  The system will leverage existing APIs and libraries to minimize development time, focusing on integrating different input modalities for a more intuitive user experience.  The significance lies in exploring the fusion of voice and gesture recognition for seamless home automation control.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  PyAudio (for audio input), SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text), OpenCV (for computer vision and gesture recognition),  a suitable API for the target smart appliance (e.g., IFTTT, a specific appliance's API).
* **Hardware:**  A microphone, a webcam (or other camera capable of providing video input), and the target smart appliance.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to basic voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Set brightness to 50%".
- **Gesture Control:** Implement recognition of simple hand gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, hand position for brightness level).  Consider a limited set for this prototype.
- **Appliance Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate with a chosen smart home appliance via its API.
- **Error Handling:** Provide feedback to the user in case of voice recognition failures or invalid commands.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display the current appliance state (on/off, brightness level) visually.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a home automation hub (e.g., Home Assistant).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  More sophisticated gesture recognition using a machine learning model (pre-trained model for quicker implementation).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary libraries (Python, PyAudio, SpeechRecognition, OpenCV, and the relevant API library).
2. **Voice Command Integration:** Implement voice recognition using SpeechRecognition, and map voice commands to API calls for controlling the appliance.
3. **Gesture Recognition (Simplified):** Utilize OpenCV to detect simple hand gestures (e.g., open/closed hand, hand position in the frame). Map these to appliance control functions.  Use pre-built gesture recognition models where possible.
4. **API Integration:** Establish connection with the chosen smart appliance API and test functionality.
5. **UI Development (Basic):** Create a simple GUI (e.g., using Tkinter) to display the appliance's current state.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Real-time gesture recognition can be unreliable due to lighting conditions and variations in hand positions.  Use simple gestures and consider pre-trained models to mitigate this.
- **API Limitations:** The chosen smart appliance API might have limitations on the types of commands or data it accepts.  Choose a well-documented API and be prepared for potential integration hurdles.


## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience in integrating various input modalities (voice and gesture) for a single application.
-  Enhance skills in using OpenCV for computer vision tasks and integrating APIs for external services.
