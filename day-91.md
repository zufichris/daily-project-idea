# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI agent that learns to play a miniature game using reinforcement learning (RL). The game will be a simplified version of a classic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four) to allow for quick prototyping and training within a day or two. The focus will be on implementing a Q-learning algorithm to train the agent and observing its performance improvement over time.  The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  NumPy, Gym (or a custom environment), Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (simplified version of a classic game).
    - A Q-learning agent that learns optimal strategies through trial and error.
    - An evaluation metric to track the agent's performance (e.g., win rate).
    - Basic visualization of the agent's learning curve (e.g., plot of rewards over episodes).
    - Ability to play against the trained AI agent.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy implementation with decaying epsilon.
    - Incorporating a simple GUI using Pygame for a more interactive experience.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement a simplified game environment (e.g., a NumPy array representing the game board).  Consider using Gym for a structured environment or creating a custom one if time allows.
2. **Agent Implementation:**  Implement the Q-learning algorithm. Define the state space, action space, and reward function for the game.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively runs the game, updates the Q-table based on the agent's actions and rewards, and tracks the agent's performance.
4. **Evaluation and Visualization:**  Evaluate the agent's performance after training by playing multiple games against it and plot the learning curve to visualize its improvement.
5. **Interactive Play (Optional):**  If time permits, implement a simple interactive interface (e.g., using Pygame) allowing a human player to compete against the AI.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **State Space Explosion:**  For more complex games, the state space might be large, impacting training speed and memory usage.  Simplification of the game rules is crucial to manage this.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding the right learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon decay rate can be challenging. Experimentation and observation of the learning curve are necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning principles and Q-learning algorithm implementation.
- Experience with designing and implementing simple game environments.
- Understanding of state space, action space, and reward functions in RL.
