# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game using reinforcement learning (RL).  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts, rather than creating a highly sophisticated AI. The game will be a simplified version of a known game (e.g., a customized version of Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified maze navigation). This allows for quick implementation and clear observation of the learning process.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional and easily understandable game environment.
- **RL Agent:** An agent that learns through trial and error using a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
- **Training Loop:** A clear training loop that iteratively improves the agent's performance.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics to track the agent's learning progress (e.g., win rate, average reward).
- **Visualization (Optional):** A simple visualization of the game state and agent's actions.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN) if starting with a simpler method).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Incorporate exploration-exploitation strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to balance exploration and exploitation during training.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment using OpenAI Gym or create a custom environment in Python. This involves defining the state space, action space, reward function, and game rules.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on the current state and learned Q-values.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively interacts with the environment, updates the agent's knowledge, and tracks performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent's performance against a random or rule-based opponent.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Add basic visualization to observe the game and agent's actions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for guiding the agent's learning effectively.  An improperly designed reward function can lead to unintended behavior.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) might require experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust as needed.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like state, action, reward, and different RL algorithms.
- **Python Programming for AI:**  This project improves skills in using Python libraries for building and training AI agents.
