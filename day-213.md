# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and training a basic AI agent to play it using reinforcement learning.  The game will be deliberately simplistic to allow for a functional AI to be trained within a day or two.  This project highlights the core concepts of reinforcement learning in a practical, tangible application.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), PyTorch (or TensorFlow) for reinforcement learning, NumPy (for numerical computations).
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm), terminal or command prompt.

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple Game Engine:**  A 2D game environment using Pygame. The game could be a simple maze navigation, a basic platformer with a single obstacle, or a simple ball-and-paddle game.
- **Agent Implementation:** An AI agent that interacts with the game environment using an action space (e.g., move left, move right, jump).
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:** Implementation of a simple reinforcement learning algorithm like Q-learning or SARSA.
- **Reward System:** Defining a reward function that encourages the agent to achieve the game's objective (e.g., reaching the goal, collecting points).
- **Training Loop:** A training loop that iteratively allows the agent to play the game, learn from its experiences, and improve its performance over time.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm like Deep Q-Network (DQN) if time allows.  Visualizing the agent's learning progress using graphs or plots.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:**  Design and implement the core game mechanics using Pygame. Focus on simplicity and clarity.
2. **Agent and Environment Setup:** Define the agent's action space, observation space (game state), and reward function.  Integrate the agent into the game loop.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Implementation:** Choose and implement a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
4. **Training and Evaluation:** Run the training loop for a set number of iterations.  Evaluate the agent's performance periodically to monitor its progress.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** Based on evaluation results, adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) or the reward function to optimize the agent's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen reinforcement learning algorithm can be time-consuming. Start with default values and adjust incrementally.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can hinder the agent's learning. Ensure the reward function accurately reflects the desired behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience in implementing and applying a reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Game AI Development:**  Develop skills in creating and integrating AI agents into game environments.
