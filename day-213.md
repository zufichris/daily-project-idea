# Automated Code Style Enforcement Bot

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple Discord bot that automatically enforces a pre-defined code style guide within a designated channel.  The bot will analyze code snippets posted in the channel and provide feedback, highlighting style violations.  This is valuable for teams collaborating on code, promoting consistency and readability.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Discord.py library
- `flake8` (or similar linter)  
- Optional: A code formatter like `black`

## Features & Requirements

- **Code Snippet Analysis:** The bot should identify code snippets (e.g., those enclosed in triple backticks) within messages.
- **Linting & Feedback:** The bot will use `flake8` to analyze the code and report any style violations directly in the channel.
- **Error Reporting:** The bot should provide clear and concise error messages, including line numbers and descriptions.
- **Channel Restriction:** The bot should only operate within a designated Discord channel.
- **Ignore Command:** A command to allow users to temporarily ignore linting for specific messages.


- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Integration with a code formatter (like `black`) to automatically suggest or apply fixes.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Support for multiple programming languages via configurable linters.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Discord bot:** Create a Discord bot application and obtain the bot token. Install the `discord.py` library.
2. **Implement Code Analysis:** Integrate `flake8` to analyze code snippets extracted from messages using regular expressions.
3. **Discord Integration:**  Write functions to receive messages, extract code, perform linting, and post results back to the channel.
4. **Command Handling:** Implement the ignore command using simple command parsing.
5. **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and include basic logging for debugging.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robust Code Snippet Extraction:**  Accurately identifying code snippets from potentially messy user input requires careful regular expression design.  Edge cases (e.g., backticks within code blocks) need to be considered.
- **Performance:** Processing large code snippets might be slow. Optimizations (like caching or asynchronous processing) could be necessary for scalability.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of Discord bot development using `discord.py`.
- Gain experience in integrating external tools (linters) within a larger application.
- Practice utilizing regular expressions for text processing.
