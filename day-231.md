# TinyML-Based Real-Time Object Detection for a Mobile Robot

## Overview
This project aims to develop a tinyML-based real-time object detection system for a mobile robot, allowing it to identify and react to specific objects in its environment.  The focus will be on minimizing computational resources and maximizing speed, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms commonly found in mobile robotics.  This is significant because it allows for greater autonomy and responsiveness in robots without the need for powerful, energy-hungry processors.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python (with TensorFlow Lite Micro)
- **Hardware:**  A microcontroller compatible with TensorFlow Lite Micro (e.g., STM32, ESP32), a camera module (e.g., OV2640), and a mobile robot platform (e.g., a small chassis with motors).
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow Lite Micro, OpenCV (for camera interface), a suitable robotics library depending on the robot platform.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system must detect pre-defined objects (e.g., red ball, person) in real-time using a tinyML model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track detected objects across frames to maintain consistent identification.
- **Distance Estimation:** Provide a rough estimate of the distance to detected objects using image processing techniques.
- **Basic Robot Control:** Integrate object detection with simple robot controls (e.g., follow a detected object, avoid obstacles).
- **Data Logging:** Log detected objects and their positions for analysis and improvement.

- **Advanced Features:**
    - **Multiple Object Detection:** Detect multiple instances of the same or different objects.
    - **Model retraining:**  Implement a simple retraining pipeline to adapt to new objects.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Model Selection & Conversion:** Choose a pre-trained object detection model suitable for TensorFlow Lite Micro, convert it, and optimize it for size and speed.
2. **Hardware Integration:** Connect the camera and microcontroller, configure the necessary libraries, and ensure communication between them.
3. **Object Detection Implementation:** Integrate the converted model into the microcontroller code, process camera frames, and perform object detection.
4. **Robot Control Integration:** Implement basic robot control commands based on the detected objects (e.g., move towards the object, stop if an obstacle is detected).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system in a controlled environment, refine parameters, and optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Optimization:** Finding a balance between model accuracy and its size/speed is crucial for tinyML.  Experimentation with different model architectures and quantization techniques might be needed.
- **Real-time Performance:** Ensuring the entire system runs smoothly in real-time on the limited processing power of the microcontroller can be challenging.


## Learning Outcomes
- **TinyML Implementation:** Gain practical experience in deploying and optimizing machine learning models for resource-constrained embedded systems.
- **Robotics System Integration:** Develop skills in integrating computer vision and machine learning with robotic control systems.
