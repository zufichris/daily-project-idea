# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Robotic Arm Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, real-time system for controlling a robotic arm using micro-gestures captured via a webcam.  The goal is to create a proof-of-concept demonstrating the feasibility of controlling robotic manipulation tasks with minimal input, ideal for applications where precise control isn't crucial, but quick, intuitive interaction is desired.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking), PySerial (for serial communication with the robotic arm, if applicable), a suitable robotic arm control library (e.g., for specific robotic arms).
* **Hardware:** Webcam, Robotic arm (optional, can simulate with onscreen graphics), computer with sufficient processing power.

## Features & Requirements

- **Hand Detection and Tracking:** Accurately detect and track a single hand in the webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize 3-4 predefined micro-gestures (e.g., open hand, closed fist, pointing index finger, thumb up) based on hand landmark positions.
- **Robotic Arm Control Mapping:** Map recognized gestures to specific actions of the robotic arm (e.g., open/close gripper, move in X/Y direction).
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Display the detected hand gestures and corresponding robotic arm actions on screen.
- **Calibration:**  Allow for simple calibration of gesture-to-action mappings.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Gesture Refinement:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., using a small dataset of hand poses) for more robust and accurate gesture recognition.
- **Multiple Arm Control:** Extend the system to control multiple robotic arms simultaneously using different hands.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PySerial if needed).  If using a physical robotic arm, establish communication and understand its control API.
2. **Hand Detection & Tracking:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track hand landmarks in the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Define thresholds and logic to classify the detected hand landmarks into the predefined gestures.
4. **Arm Control Mapping:**  Implement the mapping between recognized gestures and robotic arm actions. This might involve sending commands over serial if using a physical arm, or updating onscreen graphics if simulating.
5. **Integration and Testing:** Combine the above components, test the systemâ€™s responsiveness and accuracy.  Refine thresholds and mappings as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Robust hand detection and tracking can be challenging under varying lighting conditions.  Experiment with different image processing techniques (e.g., histogram equalization) to improve robustness.
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Precise and reliable gesture recognition may require careful selection of feature extraction techniques and potentially more sophisticated machine learning models.  Start with simple thresholds and iterate based on observed performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides practical experience in real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Gain practical experience in robotic arm control:**  Understanding and implementing robotic arm control interfaces (whether simulated or physical).
