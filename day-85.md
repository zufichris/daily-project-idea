# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple self-balancing robotic arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller.  The arm will maintain a stable upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating the implementation of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm. This project is significant as it provides a practical hands-on experience with a fundamental control system widely used in robotics and automation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 for advanced features)
* **Servo Motor:** A high-torque servo motor capable of supporting a small weight.
* **Sensor:**  MPU6050 (6-axis IMU) for measuring angular velocity and acceleration.
* **Programming Language:** Arduino C++
* **Libraries:**  MPU6050 library, Servo library
* **Tools:**  Soldering iron, breadboard, jumper wires, 3D printer (optional for arm structure).

## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain a stable upright position.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  Use a PID algorithm to adjust the servo motor based on sensor feedback to maintain balance.
- **Sensor Integration:** Accurate reading and processing of data from the MPU6050.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  The program should respond to disturbances in real-time.
- **Manual Control (Optional):**  Allow for manual control of the arm's position using a potentiometer or other interface.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementing a Kalman filter for noise reduction in sensor data.
- **Optional Feature:** Adding a small payload to the arm's end to increase the challenge.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the microcontroller according to the datasheets. Construct a simple arm structure (3D printed or otherwise).
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the MPU6050 to obtain accurate readings.
3. **PID Tuning:** Implement a basic PID algorithm and tune the proportional (Kp), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains to achieve stability. Start with small values and iteratively adjust until optimal performance is achieved.
4. **Control Loop:** Integrate the sensor readings and PID output to control the servo motor, continuously adjusting the arm's position to maintain balance.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system's responsiveness to disturbances and refine the PID gains as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustment.  Experimentation and understanding the effects of each gain are crucial.
- **Sensor Noise:** The MPU6050 can be susceptible to noise, affecting the accuracy of the control system.  Implementing a low-pass filter or a Kalman filter can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** Gain practical experience implementing and tuning a PID control system, a fundamental concept in robotics and control engineering.
- **Sensor Integration:** Learn how to integrate sensor data into a control system to create a closed-loop feedback mechanism.
