# Minimalist Robotic Arm Path Planning with Obstacle Avoidance

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a minimalist path planning algorithm for a robotic arm to navigate a simple 2D environment with obstacles, focusing on efficiency and rapid prototyping. The goal is to generate a collision-free path from a starting point to a target point using a simplified model and a computationally inexpensive algorithm.  This is significant because efficient path planning is crucial for many robotic applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Pygame (for visualization)
* **Optional:**  Robotics Simulation Environment (e.g., PyBullet, V-REP) for a more realistic simulation.


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Representation:**  Represent the environment using a simple 2D grid or list of obstacle coordinates.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implement a basic A* search algorithm to find the shortest path.
- **Collision Detection:**  Implement a simple collision detection mechanism to ensure the robotic arm doesn't collide with obstacles.
- **Path Visualization:** Display the environment, obstacles, and the calculated path using Matplotlib or Pygame.
- **Arm Kinematics (Simplified):**  Model the robotic arm with a simplified 2D kinematic model (e.g., two-link arm).

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated path smoothing algorithm to reduce sharp turns.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate with a real or simulated robotic arm for actual movement execution.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the 2D environment, including obstacle positions and the start/goal points.  Use a simple data structure (e.g., NumPy array or list).
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* algorithm to find a collision-free path.  Focus on a basic implementation for a fast prototype.
3. **Collision Detection:** Implement a function to check for collisions between the robotic arm's links and obstacles at each point along the generated path.
4. **Path Visualization:** Visualize the environment, obstacles, and the found path using Matplotlib or Pygame.
5. **(Optional) Simulation/Hardware Integration:** If using a simulator, integrate the path into the robot's control system.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:**  For complex environments, the A* search can be computationally expensive.  Strategies to mitigate this include using heuristics effectively and employing optimizations.
- **Path Smoothing:** Smoothing a path found with A* can be challenging while maintaining collision avoidance.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of graph search algorithms (A*) and their applications in robotics.
- Practical experience in implementing collision detection and path planning in a simplified robotic system.
