# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for calibrating a robotic arm's end-effector position using computer vision.  A pre-placed calibration target with known dimensions will be identified and located using a camera, and this information will be used to adjust the robot's internal coordinate system, improving accuracy. This is a crucial step in robotic manipulation and demonstrates practical applications of computer vision in robotics.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Robotics Library:** ROS (Robot Operating System) or a similar framework (e.g., moveit!) if working with a physical robot.  If simulating, a robotics simulator like Gazebo or PyBullet.
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
- **Camera:** A USB webcam or a dedicated machine vision camera.
- **Robotic Arm:** A physical robotic arm (optional, simulation can be used)


## Features & Requirements
- **Target Detection:**  Detect and locate a pre-defined calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) in the camera image using OpenCV's feature detection and pose estimation capabilities.
- **Coordinate Transformation:**  Calculate the transformation matrix between the camera coordinate system and the robot's base coordinate system.
- **Calibration Adjustment:**  Use the calculated transformation to adjust the robot's end-effector position and orientation.
- **Position Verification:**  Verify the calibration by commanding the robot to move to a known location and comparing the actual position to the expected position.
- **Data Logging:** Log all relevant data (target location, transformation matrix, robot commands, actual position) for analysis and debugging.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a robust method for handling noisy images or occlusions.  Incorporate error correction and iterative refinement to further improve accuracy.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, ROS/moveit!, PyBullet/Gazebo if using simulation), and configure the camera.
2. **Target Detection & Pose Estimation:** Implement OpenCV code to detect the calibration target and estimate its pose (position and orientation) in the camera frame.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Calculate the transformation matrix between the camera and robot base frames using available calibration data or methods (e.g., homogeneous transformation).
4. **Calibration Adjustment:**  Integrate the transformation matrix with the robotic arm control system.  Command the robot to move to a target location and update its internal model based on the transformation.
5. **Verification and Refinement:** Test the calibration by commanding the robot to several known locations and comparing the actual positions to expected positions. Refine the calibration parameters if necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accurate Pose Estimation:**  Achieving accurate pose estimation from camera images can be challenging due to noise, lighting conditions, and potential errors in the calibration target. Experiment with different feature detection algorithms and parameters to improve accuracy.
- **Integration with Robotic Arm Control:** Seamlessly integrating the computer vision results with the robotic arm's control system requires careful consideration of data formats and communication protocols.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of computer vision:**  Gain hands-on experience with using computer vision techniques (feature detection, pose estimation) for robotic applications.
- **Robotics control and calibration:** Develop a deeper understanding of robotic arm kinematics and calibration procedures, reinforcing the importance of precise positioning in automation.
