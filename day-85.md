# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera, leveraging WebRTC for efficient streaming and client-side processing. This allows for immediate feedback and is useful in applications like basic security monitoring or interactive art installations.  The focus is on a minimal viable product (MVP) showcasing core functionality within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js for potential backend extensions)
* **Framework/Library:** TensorFlow.js (for object detection), WebRTC (for video streaming), potentially a JavaScript UI library like React or Vue.js for a cleaner interface.
* **Tools:** A web browser (Chrome recommended), a webcam.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video stream from the webcam using the browser's media devices API.
* **Object Detection:** Detect pre-defined objects (e.g., person, car) within the video stream using a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model.
* **Object Tracking:** Track detected objects across frames to maintain identification.  Bounding boxes should be displayed around the detected objects.
* **Basic UI:**  Display the video stream with overlaid bounding boxes and potentially object labels.
* **Performance Monitoring:** (Optional)  Display basic FPS (Frames Per Second) to gauge system performance.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a simple alert system if a specific object (e.g., a person) enters a predefined area within the frame.
- **Advanced Features:**  Explore different object detection models in TensorFlow.js to compare accuracy and performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Development Environment:**  Install Node.js (if needed), include TensorFlow.js and WebRTC libraries in your project.
2. **Implement Video Capture:** Use the browser's MediaDevices API to access the webcam and display the video stream on the webpage.
3. **Integrate Object Detection:** Load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model for object detection and apply it to each frame of the video stream.
4. **Implement Object Tracking:** Employ a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using bounding box centroids) to track detected objects across frames.
5. **Build Basic UI:** Create a minimal UI displaying the video with overlaid bounding boxes and object labels.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:**  Object detection can be computationally intensive.  Consider using a smaller, faster model or optimizing the code to ensure real-time performance. This may necessitate model simplification or reduced resolution.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model for TensorFlow.js that balances accuracy and speed will be crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of WebRTC for real-time communication.** This project provides hands-on experience with building a real-time application using WebRTC.
- **Gain practical experience with TensorFlow.js for client-side machine learning.** This strengthens skills in integrating pre-trained models and handling image processing in a browser environment.
