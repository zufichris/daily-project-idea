# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, up/down, circle) to control smart home devices like lights or the thermostat. This is significant as it offers a contactless and intuitive alternative to traditional control methods.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  PyAutoGUI (automation)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, (optional) Raspberry Pi for deployment

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Capture:**  Accurately capture and process webcam feed to detect hand presence and gesture type.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Identify pre-defined gestures (swipe left/right, up/down, circle) with reasonable accuracy.
- **Device Control:**  Implement commands to control simulated or real smart home devices (e.g., change light brightness, adjust thermostat temperature).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual feedback (e.g., on-screen display) showing recognized gestures and their effect.
- **Calibration:** Allow for user calibration to account for individual hand size and lighting conditions.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporate multiple gesture sequences for more complex commands (e.g., double swipe for dimming lights).
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a real smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant) for actual device control.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Set up webcam feed using OpenCV, potentially applying background subtraction techniques for noise reduction.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Utilize MediaPipe's hand tracking module to detect hand landmarks and extract relevant features for gesture classification.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Train a simple classifier (e.g., a k-Nearest Neighbors model) on a small dataset of pre-recorded gestures.
4. **Device Control Implementation:** Use PyAutoGUI (or direct API calls if integrating with a smart home platform) to simulate key presses or send commands to control smart devices.
5. **Feedback and Refinement:** Implement visual feedback to display recognized gestures and refine the classifier by addressing misclassifications.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy and Robustness:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition, especially under varying lighting conditions or with different hand sizes, may be challenging.  Data augmentation techniques might be necessary.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Ensuring real-time processing speed is crucial for a seamless user experience. Optimization might be needed to improve frame rates.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** This project will reinforce skills in image processing, feature extraction, and classifier training.
- **Real-time Application Development:** Gain experience building a real-time application with tight constraints on processing time and accuracy requirements.
