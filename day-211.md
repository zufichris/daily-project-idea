# Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a rapid prototype of an inverse kinematics solver for a robotic arm with three degrees of freedom (DOF).  The solver will take a desired end-effector position and orientation as input and calculate the corresponding joint angles required to achieve that pose. This is a fundamental problem in robotics, and a fast, efficient solution is crucial for real-time control.  The daily challenge will focus on implementing a numerical solution method (e.g., Jacobian transpose method) for a specific arm configuration.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- **IDE:**  Any preferred Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Forward Kinematics:**  Implement forward kinematics to calculate the end-effector pose given joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics Solver:** Implement a Jacobian transpose method or similar iterative numerical method to solve for joint angles given a desired end-effector pose.
- **Input/Output:**  Allow for user input of desired (x, y, z) coordinates and (roll, pitch, yaw) orientation. Output the calculated joint angles.
- **Error Handling:**  Implement basic error handling for invalid inputs or non-reachable poses.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Visualize the robotic arm and its movement using Matplotlib.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a different numerical method (e.g., damped least squares).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add collision detection to prevent the arm from colliding with itself or obstacles (requires a simplified model).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Robot Geometry:** Define the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters or a similar representation of the 3-DOF robotic arm's geometry.
2. **Implement Forward Kinematics:** Write a function to calculate the end-effector's position and orientation based on the joint angles using the defined geometry.
3. **Implement Inverse Kinematics Solver:** Implement the chosen numerical method (e.g., Jacobian transpose) to iteratively solve for the joint angles that achieve the desired end-effector pose.  This involves calculating the Jacobian matrix and updating the joint angles based on the error.
4. **Input/Output:**  Create a user interface (can be simple command-line input) to allow the user to specify the desired pose and display the calculated joint angles.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the solver with various desired poses and refine the implementation based on the results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Singularity Issues:** Numerical methods can struggle near singular configurations of the robotic arm. Implementing singularity avoidance techniques or choosing a robust method is crucial.
- **Convergence:**  Iterative methods may not converge to a solution for all desired poses.  Adjusting parameters like step size or adding damping can improve convergence.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Inverse Kinematics Concepts:**  This project strengthens understanding of the mathematical foundations of inverse kinematics and the application of numerical methods.
- **Practical Experience with Jacobian Transpose Method:** Hands-on experience implementing and troubleshooting a common inverse kinematics algorithm.
