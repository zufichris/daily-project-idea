#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using a simplified reinforcement learning approach.  The focus is on a proof-of-concept implementation within a limited timeframe, leveraging readily available simulation tools.  This allows exploration of RL principles in a practical context without the complexities of real-world drone hardware.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar)
* **Simulation Environment:** PyBullet (or similar physics engine)
* **Optional:**  A simple drone simulator (e.g., AirSim) if PyBullet proves insufficiently realistic.

## Features & Requirements

- **Environment Setup:** Create a simulated 3D environment with static obstacles (cubes, cylinders).
- **Agent Definition:** Define a simple drone agent with basic movement controls (forward, backward, left, right, up, down).
- **Reward Function:** Implement a reward function that incentivizes obstacle avoidance and reaching a target point.
- **Training Loop:**  Train the agent using a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization – PPO).
- **Visualization:**  Visualize the agent's behavior and learning progress within the simulation.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a more sophisticated reward function incorporating distance to obstacles and target.
- **Advanced Feature:**  Experiment with different RL algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Network – DQN) and compare performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the chosen simulation environment (PyBullet) and create a simple scene with obstacles and a target location.
2. **Agent & Reward:** Define the drone agent's action space and observation space.  Implement a basic reward function (e.g., positive reward for reaching the target, negative reward for collision).
3. **Training:** Initialize and train the RL agent using PPO (or another chosen algorithm) for a limited number of iterations. Monitor the training progress.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance in the simulation environment, assessing its success rate in reaching the target without collisions.
5. **Visualization & Analysis:**  Visualize the agent's trajectory and analyze the learning curve to assess the effectiveness of the training process.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:** Training RL agents can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the environment or reducing the training iterations might be necessary to stay within the timeframe.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can require experimentation.  Prioritize a basic configuration and iterate if time allows.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.
- **Simulation-Based Development:** Understand the benefits of using simulation for prototyping and testing robotic control algorithms before deploying them on physical hardware.
