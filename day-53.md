# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic self-balancing robot control system using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The robot will be simulated, allowing for rapid iteration and testing of the PID tuning parameters without the need for physical hardware.  This allows for a focused exploration of control theory principles within a short timeframe. The significance lies in understanding and implementing a fundamental control algorithm widely used in robotics and automation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Optional:**  Matplotlib (for plotting control signals and robot state).

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balancing:** The robot should maintain an upright position when disturbed (simulated push).
- **PID Controller Implementation:**  A functional PID controller should be implemented to adjust the motor speeds based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
- **Real-time Simulation:**  The robot's dynamics should be simulated in real-time, providing visual feedback.
- **Parameter Tuning:**  The PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) should be adjustable to observe their effect on the robot's stability.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the robot's angle, angular velocity, and motor outputs for analysis.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implementation of a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., LQR) for comparison.
- **Advanced Feature:**  Adding noise to the sensor readings to simulate real-world imperfections.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Simulation Environment:** Create a simplified 2D robot model using Pygame.  Define its physical properties (mass, inertia) and simulate its dynamics using basic physics equations (Newton's laws).
2. **Implement the PID Controller:**  Write the PID controller algorithm, taking the robot's angle and angular velocity as inputs and calculating the required motor torques.
3. **Integrate Controller and Simulation:** Connect the PID controller to the simulation. The controller's output should directly influence the robot's movement.
4. **Tune the PID Gains:** Experiment with different values for Kp, Ki, and Kd, observing the robot's stability. Aim for a balance between speed of response and oscillation.
5. **(Optional) Data Logging and Visualization:** If using Matplotlib, plot the control signals and robot state over time to analyze the controller's performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gain values can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with small values and gradually increase them.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation directly impacts the controller's performance.  Ensure the model adequately captures the robot's dynamics.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID Control Principles:** This project strengthens understanding of PID controllers and their application in stabilizing dynamic systems.
- **Practical Application of Simulation:**  The project provides hands-on experience in creating and utilizing simulations for rapid prototyping and algorithm development.
