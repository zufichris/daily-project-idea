# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, mini-game AI using reinforcement learning (RL).  The AI will learn to play the game through trial and error, demonstrating the core principles of RL in a concise and readily observable manner.  This project emphasizes rapid prototyping and focuses on core RL concepts rather than complex game mechanics.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), Gym (optional, for a more structured RL environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch) for the RL agent.

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items).
    - A basic RL agent using Q-learning or a simpler algorithm.
    - Training loop that allows the AI to learn over a set number of episodes.
    - Visualization of the AI's progress and learned policy.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Incorporating a reward shaping mechanism to guide the learning process more effectively.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Design and implement a simple 2D game environment using Pygame.  Focus on a minimal but functional design.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity) and implement the agent's logic for choosing actions based on its current state and learned Q-values.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively runs the game, allowing the agent to learn from its interactions with the environment.  Track performance metrics (e.g., rewards, steps to goal).
4. **Visualization:** Implement visualization to display the game, the agent's actions, and its learning progress (e.g., plotting reward over time).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Evaluate the agent's performance.  Iterate on the RL algorithm parameters or the game environment to improve learning efficiency.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the AI to learn the desired behavior can be challenging.  Experimentation might be required.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) can impact learning speed and effectiveness.  A systematic approach (grid search or random search) might be beneficial.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: This project provides hands-on experience with core RL concepts such as Q-learning, state-action spaces, and reward functions.
- Game AI Development: This project introduces basic game AI development principles and techniques, using RL for agent behavior.
