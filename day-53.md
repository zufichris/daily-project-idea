# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI Feedback

## Overview
This project aims to build a lightweight tool that automatically enforces a specific code style guide using a combination of static analysis and AI-powered feedback.  This addresses the common challenge of maintaining consistent coding style across a project, particularly useful for quick fixes or daily code reviews. The significance lies in its potential to improve code readability and maintainability with minimal developer effort.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pylint (or similar static analysis tool)
- Transformers library (for AI-powered feedback – optional, can be replaced with rule-based suggestions)
- A pre-trained code style model (e.g., from Hugging Face – optional)
- Command-line interface (CLI) framework (e.g., `typer` or `click`)


## Features & Requirements
- **Static Analysis:** Integrate Pylint to detect style violations based on a chosen style guide (e.g., PEP 8).
- **Violation Reporting:** Generate a clear report listing all detected style violations with file location and line numbers.
- **Automated Correction (Basic):** Automatically correct simple style violations (e.g., whitespace, line length).
- **AI-Powered Suggestions (Advanced):**  Use a pre-trained model to provide more nuanced suggestions for complex style issues.
- **Customizable Configuration:** Allow users to specify a style guide and configure the level of strictness.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary packages (Python, Pylint, Transformers if applicable, CLI framework).
2. **Integrate Pylint:** Write Python code to run Pylint on a given code file and parse its output.
3. **Develop Reporting Mechanism:**  Create a function to format the Pylint output into a user-friendly report (console or file).
4. **Implement Basic Auto-Correction:** (Optional) Use Pylint's auto-fix capabilities or write simple functions to correct basic style issues.
5. **Integrate AI Feedback (Optional):** If using a pre-trained model, integrate it to provide feedback on more complex style aspects.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Handling Complex Style Issues:**  AI models may struggle with subtle style inconsistencies; handling edge cases requires careful consideration.
- **Performance Optimization:** Processing large codebases may be slow; optimizing the analysis and reporting process is crucial for a daily tool.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of static analysis techniques and their practical application in code quality management.
- Practical experience with integrating AI models (if applicable) into software tools, showcasing the potential of AI-assisted development.
