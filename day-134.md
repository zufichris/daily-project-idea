# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with Real-time Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a rudimentary self-balancing robotic arm using a microcontroller and sensor data.  The arm will be designed to maintain a stable upright position despite external disturbances. This project focuses on integrating sensor feedback with control algorithms for real-time stabilization, a core concept in robotics.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with built-in IMU).
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)
* **Sensors:**  Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) (already integrated in Nano 33 BLE Sense).
* **Actuators:** Two micro servo motors.
* **Framework/Libraries:**  Arduino libraries for servo control and IMU data acquisition.
* **Physical Components:**  Lightweight construction materials (e.g., acrylic, balsa wood), servo motors, power supply, connecting wires, mounting hardware.


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain a near-vertical posture.
- **Real-time Control:** The system should respond to disturbances with a latency under 50ms.
- **Sensor Fusion:**  Utilizing IMU data to estimate the arm's orientation and angular velocity.
- **PID Control:** Implementing a PID controller to regulate the servo motor positions based on error signals.
- **Basic Movement Capability:**  Option to trigger limited angular movement of the arm using a button or other input.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementing a Kalman filter for noise reduction in sensor data.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Adding an external camera feed for visual feedback and more complex control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the robotic arm structure and connect the sensors and actuators to the microcontroller.
2. **Sensor Calibration and Data Acquisition:** Calibrate the IMU and write code to read and process IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller to stabilize the arm based on the IMU feedback.
4. **Real-time Control Loop:**  Create a real-time control loop that continuously reads sensor data, applies the PID algorithm, and updates servo motor positions.
5. **Testing and Tuning:**  Test the system's stability, adjusting PID gains for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hardware Limitations:** Micro servo motors may have limited torque, affecting the robustness of the self-balancing. This needs careful consideration in arm design.
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments. Consider using a tuning methodology like Ziegler-Nichols.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:** Reinforces skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time control.
- **Control Systems Design:** Provides practical experience with PID control algorithms, sensor fusion, and their application in robotics.
