# Automated Code Style Checker with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to develop a command-line tool that automatically checks code style adherence based on a user-defined set of rules.  The significance lies in quickly enforcing consistent coding practices across projects, improving code readability and maintainability. This will focus on a specific language (Python chosen for its extensive linting capabilities and ease of use) but the concept is extensible.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** `pycodestyle` (or `flake8`), `argparse`, `yaml` (or `json`)
- **Tools:**  A text editor/IDE (VS Code recommended), command-line interface.

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:**  Allow users to specify coding style rules via a configuration file (YAML or JSON).  This could include things like maximum line length, indentation style, whitespace rules.
- **Code Analysis:** Parse a given Python file and check for violations against the defined rules.
- **Report Generation:** Output a clear and concise report showing the detected style violations, including file location and line numbers.
- **Customizable Severity Levels:** Allow users to assign severity levels (e.g., warning, error) to different rules.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle file not found errors and invalid configuration files.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Integration with a version control system (e.g., Git hooks) for automated style checking on commit.
- **Advanced Feature:** Support for multiple programming languages via plugin architecture (future expansion, not for the daily challenge).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Configuration Parsing:** Implement functionality to read and parse the configuration file (YAML or JSON) defining the code style rules.
2. **Code Analysis Engine:** Integrate `pycodestyle` to analyze Python code and identify style violations based on the loaded rules.
3. **Report Generation:** Create a function to generate a formatted report detailing the violations. Include file paths, line numbers, and rule descriptions.
4. **Command-Line Interface:** Use `argparse` to create a user-friendly CLI that takes the configuration file and Python file paths as arguments.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the tool with various Python files and different rule configurations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Rule Complexity:** Handling complex or ambiguous rules accurately can be challenging.  Focus on a well-defined subset of rules for the initial implementation.
- **Error Reporting:** Providing clear and informative error messages is crucial for user understanding.  Careful consideration should be given to error handling and reporting mechanisms.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of command-line argument parsing (`argparse`) and configuration file handling (YAML/JSON).
- Gain practical experience in integrating and extending existing code analysis tools (`pycodestyle`).
