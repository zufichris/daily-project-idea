# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures to trigger pre-defined smart home actions, offering a more intuitive and hands-free interface than traditional voice or touch controls. This is particularly useful for situations where voice control is impractical or undesirable (e.g., noisy environments) or hands are occupied.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, NumPy
- **Framework:**  None (script-based)
- **Tools:**  Webcam, potentially a Raspberry Pi (for deployment, optional)

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, wave, fist) from the webcam feed.
- **Action Mapping:**  Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., turn on/off lights, adjust volume).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **GUI:** A simple graphical user interface to display the recognized gesture and associated action.
- **Calibration:** Allow users to calibrate the gesture recognition model to their specific hand movements.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporate a model training component for more personalized gesture recognition.
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a home automation platform (e.g., Home Assistant) for actual smart home control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and test the webcam feed using OpenCV.  Capture a small dataset of sample images for each gesture.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Use MediaPipe's hand detection and tracking capabilities to identify hand landmarks in the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Implement a simple classification algorithm (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors or a small pre-trained model) to classify the detected gestures based on the landmark data.
4. **Action Triggering:**  Connect the gesture classification to the execution of predefined actions (simulated initially, later integrated with a home automation platform).
5. **GUI Development:**  Create a basic GUI using a library like Tkinter to display the recognized gesture and the triggered action.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of hand detection.  Consider incorporating image preprocessing techniques (e.g., adaptive thresholding) to mitigate this issue.
- **Gesture Variability:**  Individual hand sizes and movements can differ.  A robust model might require more sophisticated techniques or a larger training dataset.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Gain practical experience with real-time image processing and computer vision techniques.
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Apply basic machine learning concepts like feature extraction and classification for a real-world application.
