# Self-Healing Robotic Arm Trajectory Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified simulation of a robotic arm that can autonomously adjust its trajectory to avoid unexpected obstacles.  The goal is to implement a basic self-healing mechanism that allows the arm to replan its path in real-time, showcasing fundamental concepts in robotics and path planning. This is a computationally manageable task for a 2-day sprint.


## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Pygame (for visualization)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A pathfinding algorithm library (e.g., `pathfinding`)


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robotic arm should detect and avoid obstacles placed in its path.
- **Trajectory Generation:** The arm should generate a smooth trajectory from a start point to an end point.
- **Collision Detection:**  Implement a basic collision detection system to identify obstacles in the robot's path.
- **Replanning:** Upon collision detection, the arm should replan its path around the obstacle.
- **Visualization:**  The arm's movement and path should be visually represented using Pygame.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement different pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra's) and compare their performance.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Introduce dynamic obstacles that move during the arm's operation.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Create a Pygame window to visualize the robot arm and obstacles. Define the robot arm's kinematic model (simplified, e.g., 2-link arm).
2. **Pathfinding Implementation:** Choose a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) and integrate it. Generate an initial trajectory from start to end point, avoiding initial static obstacles.
3. **Collision Detection:** Implement collision detection between the arm's links and obstacles.
4. **Replanning Module:** If a collision is detected, re-run the pathfinding algorithm, using the current arm position as the new start point.
5. **Visualization and Testing:** Visualize the arm's movement, original path, and replanned path. Test with different obstacle configurations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Pathfinding algorithms can be computationally expensive, especially with many obstacles.  Prioritize a fast algorithm and consider simplifying the environment or arm model if necessary.
- **Real-time Performance:** Achieving smooth, real-time replanning might require optimization techniques. Focus on a functional prototype first, then optimize.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcing understanding of pathfinding algorithms and their application in robotics.
- Gaining practical experience in collision detection and real-time replanning in a simulated robotic environment.
