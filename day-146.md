# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robotics Navigation

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI-powered image captioning system specifically tailored for robot navigation. The system will take an image from a robot's camera, generate a human-readable caption describing the scene (e.g., "Clear path ahead," "Obstacle detected: box to the left," "Stairs ahead"), and then use this caption to inform basic navigation decisions.  This is a simplified version of a complex problem, allowing for a functional prototype within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for image captioning model), a lightweight messaging system (e.g., MQTT) for simulated robot communication.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (for development), a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub), a simple robot simulator (V-REP or Gazebo - optional but recommended for testing).

## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition & Preprocessing:** The system should acquire an image from a simulated or real camera feed, and preprocess it (resize, normalize).
- **Caption Generation:**  Use a pre-trained image captioning model to generate a textual caption describing the image content.
- **Caption Parsing & Decision Making:**  Parse the generated caption to identify keywords indicative of navigation (e.g., "clear," "obstacle," "stairs"). Based on these keywords, make simple navigation decisions (e.g., move forward, stop, turn).
- **Output:** Display the image, the generated caption, and the navigation decision.
- **Logging:** Log image, caption, and decision data for analysis.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Integrate with a real robot's control system (requires hardware and more advanced robotics knowledge).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated decision-making system using a rule-based engine or simple reinforcement learning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and acquire or generate sample images relevant to robot navigation (e.g., indoor environments, obstacle courses).
2. **Model Integration & Caption Generation:** Integrate a pre-trained image captioning model (fine-tuning may be optional but would improve accuracy) and test caption generation on sample images.
3. **Caption Parsing & Decision Logic:** Develop the logic to parse captions, identify key navigation-relevant keywords, and implement simple decision-making rules.
4. **System Integration & Testing:** Integrate image acquisition, caption generation, and decision-making components. Test the system on various sample images and evaluate performance.
5. **(Optional) Robot Simulation/Integration:** If using a robot simulator, integrate the system with the simulator to test navigation commands in a simulated environment.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Pre-trained Model:** Pre-trained models might not perform perfectly on images from a robot's perspective; some fine-tuning or data augmentation may be necessary to improve accuracy.  This could limit the scope if fine-tuning is chosen.
- **Robustness of Caption Parsing:**  Designing robust caption parsing logic that handles variations in caption phrasing and potential errors in caption generation is crucial.  Consider using simple keyword matching initially for quick results.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of AI model integration:** The project strengthens skills in integrating and utilizing pre-trained AI models within a larger software system.
- **Develop practical experience in image processing and natural language processing (NLP):** Hands-on experience combining computer vision and NLP techniques for a specific robotics application.
