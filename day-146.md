# Robotic Arm Calibration & Control Optimization

## Overview

This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of a robotic arm's movements by implementing a calibration routine and optimizing its control algorithm.  The focus will be on a simulated robotic arm initially, allowing for rapid iteration and testing without needing physical hardware. This project is significant because precise control is crucial for various robotic applications, and optimizing the control loop can significantly improve performance.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyBullet (physics simulation), NumPy (numerical computation), Matplotlib (visualization)
* **Tools:**  A suitable Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), Git for version control.

## Features & Requirements

- **Simulated Robotic Arm:** A 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) robotic arm model within PyBullet.
- **Calibration Routine:** A function to calibrate the arm's joint angles to a known reference position. This involves measuring the error and adjusting accordingly.
* **PID Control Implementation:** Implement a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to control the arm's movement to target positions.
* **Trajectory Planning:** Generate simple trajectories (e.g., linear interpolation) for the robotic arm to follow.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track the accuracy and time taken for the arm to reach target positions.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., computed torque control).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Add obstacle avoidance capabilities using simple distance calculations.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Simulation:** Set up the PyBullet environment and create a 3-DOF robotic arm model.
2. **Calibration:** Implement a calibration routine using a simple iterative approach (e.g., adjusting joint angles based on error).
3. **PID Controller:** Design and implement a PID controller to control the arm's movement to specified target positions.  Start with simple tuning parameters.
4. **Trajectory Generation & Execution:**  Create a simple trajectory and test the arm's ability to follow it using the PID controller.
5. **Performance Evaluation:**  Measure the accuracy and speed of the arm's movements and visualize the results using Matplotlib.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and might require iterative adjustments. Start with a simple Ziegler-Nichols method or trial and error approach.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** PyBullet's simulation may not perfectly reflect real-world physics.  Consider simplifying the model for quicker results if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of robotic arm kinematics and control algorithms (specifically PID control).
- Practical experience with robotic simulation using PyBullet and implementing control strategies in Python.
