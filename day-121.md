# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on creating a functional, playable AI within a short timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts.  The project's significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of reinforcement learning in a limited time frame, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation.


## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras)
- NumPy
- A game library (e.g., Pygame for visualization, optional)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
    - A simple training loop to improve the agent's performance over time.
    - Ability to play against the AI agent.
    - Basic win/loss/draw statistics tracking.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Visualization of the AI's learning progress (e.g., win rate over training episodes).
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the game environment:** Define the game rules and data structures (game board, possible moves, win conditions) in Python.  A minimal text-based interface is sufficient for the core project.
2. **Implement the RL algorithm:** Choose a suitable algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity). Define the state space, action space, reward function, and learning parameters.
3. **Train the AI agent:** Create a training loop to repeatedly play the game, updating the AI's Q-values based on the outcomes.  Use a reasonable number of training iterations given the time constraint.
4. **Integrate the AI into the game:** Allow the user to play against the trained AI agent.
5. **Evaluate and refine:** Observe the AI's performance and make adjustments to the algorithm's hyperparameters or reward function as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Training a complex RL agent can be computationally expensive.  Consider using a simpler algorithm or reducing the number of training iterations.  Pre-trained models could be explored if time becomes an issue.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting already learned knowledge is crucial in RL.  Experiment with different exploration strategies (e.g., Îµ-greedy).


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning concepts: understanding Q-learning, state/action spaces, reward functions, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma.
- Practical experience: building and training a simple AI agent, applying RL algorithms in a concrete scenario, and managing computational limitations within a time-constrained project.
