# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified traffic light simulation that dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle density at each intersection.  The goal is to minimize overall wait times and improve traffic flow, demonstrating a basic application of reinforcement learning or a simple heuristic optimization algorithm.  This is a scaled-down version of a complex real-world problem, allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for visualization), potentially a simple reinforcement learning library like `gym` (optional, for more advanced versions).

## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Simulation:** Simulate vehicles arriving at an intersection with randomized arrival times and speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller that alternates between green and red lights for each direction.
- **Density-Based Adjustment:** Adjust the duration of green lights based on the number of vehicles waiting in each direction.  A simple threshold-based approach is sufficient for a daily challenge.
- **Visualization:** Display the simulation visually, showing vehicle movements and traffic light states.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display average wait times for vehicles.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a simple reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal traffic light timings.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Simulate multiple intersections with interconnected traffic flow.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Simulation:** Create a simple model of vehicles arriving at an intersection, using random number generation for arrival times and speeds. Implement a basic traffic light controller with fixed timings.
2. **Density Measurement:** Add logic to count the number of vehicles waiting at each direction of the intersection.
3. **Adaptive Control:** Implement a heuristic to adjust the green light duration based on the measured vehicle density.  A simple rule like "extend green light if density exceeds a threshold" can be used.
4. **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib to create a visual representation of the simulation, showing vehicle movement and traffic light states.
5. **Performance Evaluation:**  Calculate and display average wait times for vehicles to quantify the simulation's effectiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Design:**  Finding an efficient and effective algorithm for dynamically adjusting traffic light timings based on vehicle density can be challenging. Starting with a simple heuristic is recommended for a daily challenge.
- **Simulation Complexity:** Balancing simulation realism with computational feasibility within a short timeframe requires careful consideration.  Simplifying assumptions (e.g., constant vehicle speed) might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithm Design:**  This project reinforces the process of designing and implementing algorithms for problem-solving, particularly in the context of optimization.
- **Simulation Techniques:**  Practicing building and running simulations to model real-world systems strengthens skills in modeling and software engineering.
