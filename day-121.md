# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The focus will be on implementing a basic Q-learning agent to learn optimal strategies within a limited timeframe.  The game's simplicity allows for quick prototyping and iterative improvement, highlighting key reinforcement learning concepts.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a grid-based game like Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Snake).
    - A Q-learning agent to control the AI opponent.
    - A basic user interface for human interaction.
    - Recording of the AI's learning progress (e.g., win rate, average game length).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementing an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
    - Visualizing the Q-table or learned policy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Design and implement the basic game rules and rendering using Pygame.  Focus on a minimal, functional version.
2. **Q-Learning Agent Implementation:**  Create the Q-learning agent with functions for state representation, action selection, reward calculation, and Q-value updates.
3. **Training Loop:**  Implement a training loop to repeatedly play the game, allowing the AI agent to learn from its interactions with the environment.
4. **Progress Monitoring:**  Include code to track and display the AI's performance metrics (win rate, etc.).
5. **User Interface Refinement (Optional):** Improve the user interface for a more enjoyable gaming experience.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Space Explosion:** For complex games, the state space can grow very large, requiring efficient state representation techniques or approximate Q-learning.  For this daily challenge, keep the game simple to avoid this issue.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon value can significantly impact performance.  Experimentation is crucial, but time constraints limit extensive hyperparameter optimization.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: Gain practical experience with Q-learning, understanding its core components and how they interact.
- Game AI Development: Learn how to integrate AI into a simple game environment, showcasing the application of reinforcement learning algorithms.
