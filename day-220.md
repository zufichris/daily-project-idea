# Smart Home Energy Optimization Agent

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple agent that learns energy consumption patterns in a smart home environment and suggests optimized energy usage schedules.  The focus is on a minimal viable product (MVP) demonstrating core machine learning principles applied to a practical problem.  The significance lies in the potential to create a personalized energy-saving system without complex hardware integrations.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python:**  For agent logic, data processing, and machine learning.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, simple time series forecasting).
- **Plotly/Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **(Optional) Home Assistant API:** For interaction with a real smart home environment (requires prior setup).


## Features & Requirements

- **Data Ingestion:**  The agent should be able to ingest historical energy consumption data (e.g., from a CSV file simulating smart meter readings).
- **Pattern Recognition:**  Implement a basic machine learning model to identify daily or weekly energy consumption patterns.
- **Optimization Suggestion:** Based on the identified patterns, the agent should provide simple optimization suggestions (e.g., "Reduce energy usage between 10 AM and 2 PM tomorrow by 15%").
- **Visualization:** Present the energy consumption data and optimization suggestions visually using charts and graphs.
- **Data Export:** Allow exporting the processed data and optimization suggestions to a file.

- **(Advanced) Real-time Integration:** Integrate with a smart home API (like Home Assistant) to fetch real-time data and potentially automate adjustments.
- **(Optional) Anomaly Detection:** Implement basic anomaly detection to identify unusual spikes in energy consumption.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Obtain or generate sample energy consumption data in CSV format. Clean and format the data using Pandas.
2. **Model Training:** Choose a suitable machine learning model (linear regression or a simple time series model) from Scikit-learn and train it on the preprocessed data.
3. **Optimization Logic:**  Develop the logic to generate optimization suggestions based on model predictions.  This could involve simple thresholds or percentage-based recommendations.
4. **Visualization & Output:**  Create visualizations using Plotly/Matplotlib to display energy usage and optimization suggestions. Implement data export functionality.
5. **(Optional) API Integration:** If using Home Assistant, implement the API calls to fetch real-time data and potentially send control commands (requires API key and proper setup).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:**  The accuracy of the optimization suggestions heavily depends on the quality of the input data.  Handling missing or noisy data is crucial.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the appropriate machine learning model depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired level of accuracy.  Experimentation might be required.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of basic machine learning concepts (model training, prediction, evaluation).
- Practical experience in data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization using Python libraries.
