# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera's field of view, track its movement, and provide visual feedback (e.g., bounding box, coordinates). This is a valuable exercise in integrating computer vision, embedded systems, and real-time processing.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB Camera, Monitor (optional)
- **Tools:** SSH client (for remote access), a text editor (VS Code, Nano etc.)


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect a specific object (predefined color or shape) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position frame by frame.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display a bounding box around the detected object and its coordinates on the camera feed.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Display frames per second (FPS) to assess the system's real-time capabilities.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Record the object's tracked coordinates over time.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple prediction algorithm to anticipate the object's future position.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Allow for object selection through a user interface (GUI).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi, and ensure all necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) are installed.  Test camera functionality.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm using OpenCV's functions for color filtering and thresholding. Focus on detecting a single, easily distinguishable object.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., optical flow) to track the detected object's centroid across frames.
4. **Visual Feedback:** Overlay a bounding box and coordinates onto the camera feed, displaying the tracking results in real-time.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Measure and display the FPS to evaluate the system's performance.  Experiment with different image resolutions to optimize speed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the FPS, especially with complex object detection algorithms.  Consider using simpler algorithms or optimizing code for speed.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Changes in lighting can significantly affect color-based object detection.  Explore methods for robust color detection under varying lighting conditions.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:** Gain experience in working with image and video streams in real-time, understanding the challenges of processing data within strict time constraints.
- **Computer vision techniques:**  Reinforce understanding of fundamental computer vision concepts such as object detection, tracking, and color filtering.
