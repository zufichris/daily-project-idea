# Smart Home Energy Optimization via Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary prototype of a smart home energy optimization system using reinforcement learning (RL). The system will learn to minimize energy consumption based on simulated sensor data representing appliance usage and energy prices.  The significance lies in exploring the application of RL in a real-world scenario with a short development timeframe. This allows for a quick exploration of RL concepts without requiring extensive hardware integration.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  OpenAI Gym (for RL environment), Stable Baselines3 (for RL algorithms), NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Simulated Environment:**  Create a simplified simulation of a smart home with several appliances (lights, AC, heater) with controllable power consumption and simulated energy price fluctuations.
- **RL Agent:** Implement a simple RL agent (e.g., Deep Q-Network) to learn optimal appliance control strategies.
- **Reward Function:** Define a reward function that incentivizes energy savings while maintaining user comfort (e.g., penalizing temperature deviations from a setpoint).
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize the agent's learning progress (rewards, energy consumption over time) using Matplotlib.
- **Action Space:** The agent should decide whether to turn appliances ON or OFF.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate a more sophisticated reward function accounting for time-of-use pricing.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the simulated smart home environment in OpenAI Gym, defining the state space (e.g., appliance states, current energy price, room temperature), action space (ON/OFF for each appliance), and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., DQN from Stable Baselines3) and integrate it with the environment.
3. **Training:** Train the RL agent by letting it interact with the environment and learn to optimize energy consumption.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance by measuring its cumulative reward (energy savings) and analyzing its learned policy.
5. **Visualization:**  Create plots showing the learning curve (rewards over time) and energy consumption patterns.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining an effective reward function that balances energy savings and user comfort can be challenging and might require iterative refinement.
- **Computational Cost:**  Training RL agents can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the environment or using a less complex algorithm might be necessary to achieve results within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementation.
- Understanding of how to design and implement a simulated environment for RL applications.
- Enhanced skills in data visualization and analysis using Python libraries.
