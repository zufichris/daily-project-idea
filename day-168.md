# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection controlled by an intelligent traffic light system.  The goal is to demonstrate the basic principles of adaptive traffic control using a rule-based approach or a very simple machine learning algorithm. The simulation will focus on optimizing traffic flow by adjusting signal timings based on simulated vehicle arrival rates. This project is scalable and allows for a deeper dive into traffic management algorithms in subsequent days.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `matplotlib` (for visualization), `random` (for simulating traffic), `numpy` (for numerical operations).  Optional: `pygame` (for a more visual simulation).


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:** Simulate vehicles arriving at the intersection randomly with adjustable arrival rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple rule-based system to control traffic light timings (e.g., prioritize the direction with the most vehicles waiting).
- **Traffic Flow Measurement:** Calculate and display key metrics such as average waiting time and throughput.
- **Visualization:** Display the intersection, vehicle positions, and traffic light status using `matplotlib` (or `pygame` for enhanced visuals).
- **Data Logging:** Record key metrics for analysis.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning) to learn optimal traffic light control strategies.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Introduce different vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses) with varying priorities.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create the simulation environment. Define the intersection geometry, vehicle representation, and traffic light states.
2. **Vehicle Generation & Movement:** Implement vehicle arrival based on a Poisson process (using `random`).  Simulate vehicle movement through the intersection.
3. **Basic Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple rule-based system to switch traffic lights based on the number of vehicles waiting in each direction.
4. **Data Collection & Visualization:** Collect data on waiting times and throughput. Visualize the simulation using `matplotlib`.
5. **(Optional) Advanced Control:** If time permits, implement a basic reinforcement learning algorithm to improve traffic light control.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Simplicity and Realism:**  The simulation needs to be simple enough to implement within the time constraint, yet realistic enough to demonstrate the core concepts.
- **Algorithm Design:**  Choosing and implementing an effective traffic light control algorithm, especially if attempting reinforcement learning, requires careful consideration.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of procedural programming skills in Python.
- Understanding of basic traffic simulation concepts and the challenges of intelligent traffic management.  If the advanced features are implemented, practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms will be gained.
