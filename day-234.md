# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project involves creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm.  The game will feature a visual representation of the board and game state, allowing for easy observation of the AI's decision-making process. This project balances simplicity with the opportunity to implement a classic AI algorithm, making it suitable for a 1-2 day challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (optional, for board representation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Board:** A visual representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- **Human Player Input:** Ability for a human player to make moves via mouse clicks or keyboard input.
- **Minimax AI:** An AI opponent that utilizes the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- **Win/Loss/Draw Detection:** Accurate detection and display of game outcomes.
- **Game Reset:** Functionality to restart the game easily.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Visual highlight of the AI's considered moves during its decision-making process.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Difficulty levels adjusting the search depth of the Minimax algorithm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Game Board:** Create the visual representation using Pygame, including drawing the grid and handling player input.
2. **Implement the Game Logic:**  Write functions to check for win/loss/draw conditions and manage player turns.
3. **Implement the Minimax Algorithm:** Develop the core AI logic using recursion to explore the game tree and find the optimal move.
4. **Integrate AI with the Game:** Connect the Minimax algorithm to the game loop, allowing the AI to make moves and update the visual representation.
5. **Add Game Reset and Optional Features:** Implement the reset functionality and any chosen advanced features (move highlighting or difficulty levels).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:**  Ensuring correct implementation of the recursive Minimax algorithm can be tricky, especially handling base cases and alpha-beta pruning (optional optimization).  Thorough testing is crucial.
- **Pygame Integration:**  Coordinating the game logic with the visual updates in Pygame might require careful synchronization to avoid visual glitches.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Algorithm Implementation:**  This project reinforces the understanding and practical implementation of the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental concept in game AI.
- **Game Development Practices:** The project provides experience in game development using a library like Pygame, covering aspects such as event handling, visual representation, and game loop management.
