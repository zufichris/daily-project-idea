#  AI-Powered Smart Home Device Trigger

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a smart home device that triggers actions based on real-time image recognition using a pre-trained AI model.  The device will identify specific objects or events within its camera's view and execute predefined actions, such as sending notifications, controlling smart lights, or playing sounds. This provides a foundation for more complex home automation systems driven by visual cues.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing and computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for AI model loading and inference), a suitable library for interacting with your choice of smart home platform (e.g., HomeAssistant API, Philips Hue API).
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (or similar single-board computer with camera), USB webcam.
* **AI Model:** A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5) readily available through TensorFlow Hub or PyTorch Hub.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  The system should accurately detect pre-defined objects (e.g., keys, specific people, pets) within the camera's field of view.
- **Action Triggering:** Upon detection of a specific object, the system triggers a corresponding action (e.g., sending a notification, turning on lights).
- **Configurable Actions:** Users should be able to define the actions associated with detected objects via a simple configuration file (JSON or YAML).
- **Real-time Processing:**  The system should process images and trigger actions with minimal latency.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of situations where the AI model fails to detect the target object.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Object Detection & Actions:** Handle multiple objects concurrently, triggering multiple actions simultaneously or sequentially.
- **Facial Recognition:** Instead of general object detection, integrate a facial recognition model for personalized triggers.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and the chosen smart home platform's API library) on the Raspberry Pi. Download and prepare the pre-trained AI model.
2. **Integrate AI Model:** Write Python code to load and run inference with the pre-trained AI model using OpenCV to capture camera frames.
3. **Implement Action Triggering:** Connect the object detection results to the smart home API to execute pre-defined actions based on the detected objects.
4. **Develop Configuration System:** Create a simple configuration file (JSON or YAML) allowing users to define which objects trigger which actions.
5. **Test and Refine:** Test the system with various scenarios and refine the detection thresholds and actions based on the results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing accuracy and speed in object detection can be challenging, requiring optimization of the AI model and image processing pipeline. Consider reducing image resolution if necessary for speed improvements.
- **Smart Home API Integration:** Different smart home platforms have varying APIs.  Ensure compatibility and proper authentication/authorization for the selected platform.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of AI model deployment:** Gain hands-on experience with loading, running inference, and integrating a pre-trained AI model into a real-world application.
- **Building a reactive system:** Understand how to build a system that reacts to real-time events (image detection) and triggers corresponding actions.
