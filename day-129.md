# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home device control system using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will leverage a computer vision library to detect specific hand gestures from a webcam feed and translate them into commands for controlling smart home devices (simulated in this case). This project focuses on a minimal viable product (MVP) showcasing the core functionality within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand detection), potentially a simple MQTT client for device simulation.
* **Tools:**  A webcam, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Hand Gesture Recognition:**  The system must reliably recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., fist for "on," open palm for "off," thumbs up for "increase brightness").
- **Device Control Simulation:**  The system should simulate controlling a smart light (on/off, brightness adjustment) and possibly a smart fan (on/off, speed control).
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Visual feedback should be provided on the screen, showing the recognized gesture and the corresponding action taken.
- **User Calibration (Optional):**  Allow for a brief calibration phase to adjust gesture recognition sensitivity to the user's hand size and style.
- **GUI (Optional):** A simple graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt to enhance user experience.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).  Set up the webcam and test its functionality.
2. **Gesture Recognition Implementation:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking model into the system.  Develop logic to classify the three chosen hand gestures based on landmark coordinates.
3. **Device Control Simulation:** Create a simple simulation layer for smart home devices. This could involve changing a variable representing device states or printing commands to the console.
4. **Real-time Feedback:** Implement a visual feedback mechanism (e.g., displaying the recognized gesture and simulated device state on the screen).
5. **(Optional) GUI Integration:** If time allows, integrate a simple GUI to improve user interaction.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Hand gesture recognition can be sensitive to lighting, background clutter, and hand positioning.  Robustness might require some parameter tuning or more advanced techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing video frames and performing gesture recognition in real-time can be computationally intensive.  Optimization might be necessary to achieve a smooth experience.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with real-time image processing, hand detection, and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Software Prototyping:** Practice building a functional prototype efficiently, focusing on core features and iterating based on available time.
