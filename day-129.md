# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple computer vision system to calibrate a robotic arm's end-effector position.  The goal is to create a system that uses a camera to identify a target object, and then calculates and corrects the robotic arm's position to accurately reach the object. This is a crucial step in many robotic applications requiring precise manipulation.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS for more complex arms, or a manufacturer-specific library for simpler arms).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple one like a Dobot Magician), a camera (a webcam will suffice for a prototype), and a calibration target (e.g., a colored marker).

## Features & Requirements
- **Target Detection:**  The system should accurately detect and locate a predefined target object (e.g., a red circle) in the camera's field of view using color segmentation.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** The system should convert the target's pixel coordinates in the camera image into real-world coordinates in the robotic arm's workspace. This requires a camera calibration step.
- **Arm Control:** The system should send commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the calculated target coordinates.
- **Error Correction:** The system should incorporate a basic feedback loop to account for minor positioning errors.  This could be a simple iterative approach refining the position.
- **Visualization:** Display the camera feed, detected target, and calculated arm trajectory.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporate a more robust object detection method (e.g., using a pre-trained deep learning model) instead of simple color segmentation.
- **Optional Feature:** Add a mechanism for automatically recalibrating the system if the camera or arm's position changes.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera using a chessboard pattern and OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function.  This step determines the intrinsic parameters of the camera.
2. **Target Detection:** Implement color segmentation to detect the target object in the camera feed.  Calculate the centroid of the detected object to get its pixel coordinates.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:**  Use the camera's intrinsic parameters and the known location of the camera relative to the robot arm to convert pixel coordinates to robot workspace coordinates.  This may require creating a transformation matrix.
4. **Arm Control:** Send the calculated coordinates to the robotic arm to move it to the target location using the appropriate robotic arm control library functions.
5. **Feedback Loop (Optional):** Implement a simple feedback mechanism to refine the arm's position based on the difference between the desired and actual target location.  This could involve taking a new image after the move and recalculating the position.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Camera Calibration Accuracy:** Inaccurate camera calibration will lead to significant positioning errors.  Using a high-quality calibration pattern and careful execution of the calibration process is crucial.
- **Coordinate Transformation Complexity:**  The transformation between camera coordinates and robot workspace coordinates can be complex, especially for robots with multiple degrees of freedom.  Carefully consider the robot's coordinate system and the camera's orientation.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Reinforces understanding of camera calibration, color segmentation, and coordinate transformations.
- **Robotics Control Basics:**  Provides practical experience in controlling a robotic arm and integrating computer vision with robotics.
