# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a quick calibration method for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to create a system that automatically calibrates the robot's end-effector position relative to a known target, minimizing manual adjustments and improving accuracy. This is significant for applications needing precise positioning, such as pick-and-place tasks or automated assembly.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, manufacturer-specific SDK).
- Hardware: Robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR3), webcam or camera.

## Features & Requirements
- **Target Detection:**  Detect a predefined colored target (e.g., a red sphere) using OpenCV's color filtering and object detection capabilities.
- **Position Estimation:**  Calculate the 3D coordinates of the detected target in the camera's coordinate system.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Transform the camera coordinates to the robot's coordinate system using a pre-defined transformation matrix (or estimate it if time permits).
- **Arm Movement:** Command the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the calculated target coordinates.
- **Error Correction (Optional):** Implement an iterative refinement loop to reduce positioning errors.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries, connect the robotic arm and camera, and define the target color in OpenCV.
2. **Target Detection & Position Estimation:** Write a function to detect the target in the camera feed using color filtering and calculate its 2D pixel coordinates. Convert these to 3D coordinates using camera calibration parameters (pre-calibrated or roughly estimated).
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Define or estimate a transformation matrix (using readily available calibration techniques if time allows) to convert from camera coordinates to robot coordinates.
4. **Arm Control:** Send the transformed coordinates to the robotic arm's control system to move the end-effector.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time permits, implement a simple iterative refinement loop using feedback from the robot's sensors (e.g., comparing actual position to target).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Camera Calibration:**  Accurate camera calibration is crucial for precise position estimation.  A simplified approach using known distances and a single focal length can be used initially.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Determining the precise transformation matrix between the camera and robot frames can be complex. A simplified approach (e.g., assuming a fixed offset) could suffice for a basic prototype.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of computer vision techniques for robotics.
- Experience with coordinate transformations in robotics and integrating different coordinate systems.
