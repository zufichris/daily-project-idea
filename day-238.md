# Efficient Pathfinding for a Simulated Mobile Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated mobile robot navigating a dynamic environment. The goal is to create a system that efficiently finds the shortest or most optimal path while avoiding obstacles, demonstrating real-world applications in robotics and autonomous systems.  The significance lies in showcasing efficient algorithm implementation and potential for adaptation to real-world robotics challenges.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for simulation and visualization), NetworkX (optional, for graph-based pathfinding).
- **Algorithm:** A* search algorithm (or similar efficient algorithm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Simulated Environment:**  A 2D grid-based environment with randomly placed static and dynamic obstacles.
- **Robot Representation:** A simple visual representation of the robot within the Pygame simulation.
- **Pathfinding:** Implementation of the A* algorithm to find a path from a start to a goal point, avoiding obstacles.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot should dynamically adjust its path when encountering moving obstacles.
- **Path Visualization:** Visual representation of the found path on the simulated environment.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implementation of a heuristic function for the A* algorithm to improve efficiency.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Incorporating a simple sensor model to simulate limited robot perception.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the Pygame window and initialize the grid-based environment with random static obstacles.
2. **Robot and Obstacle Creation:**  Implement the robot's visual representation and create dynamic obstacles with random movement patterns.
3. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* algorithm to find a path from a user-defined start point to a goal point, considering both static and dynamic obstacles.
4. **Path Visualization and Robot Movement:**  Visualize the calculated path and animate the robot's movement along the path, updating the path in real-time as obstacles move.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Test with various obstacle densities and movement patterns, refining the algorithm for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:**  Effectively integrating dynamic obstacle avoidance into the pathfinding algorithm can be complex, requiring real-time path recalculation.  Addressing this will require careful consideration of the algorithm's responsiveness and efficiency.
- **Heuristic Function Optimization:** Choosing or designing an appropriate heuristic function for A* can significantly impact the algorithm's performance.  Experimentation with different heuristics may be required.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Pathfinding Algorithms:**  This project provides hands-on experience implementing and optimizing a crucial algorithm used in robotics and game AI.
- **Understanding Dynamic System Simulation:**  Building and interacting with a simulated environment provides valuable experience in designing and working with dynamic systems.
