# Mini-Game AI for Existing Game Engine

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple, yet challenging AI opponent for an existing game engine (e.g., Unity, Godot) using a lightweight machine learning approach. The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning within a constrained timeframe.  The game will be extremely simple (e.g., Pong, a simplified version of Snake) to allow for quick iteration and demonstration.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with suitable game engine integration libraries)
* **Game Engine:** Unity (or Godot, if more familiar) â€“ a pre-existing, simple game project is preferred.
* **Libraries:** PyTorch (or TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment) for reinforcement learning.  A suitable Unity/Godot integration package if necessary.
* **Tools:** A text editor (VS Code recommended) and the selected game engine.

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic AI opponent:** The AI should be able to play the chosen game against a human player.
- **Reinforcement Learning Implementation:** The AI should use a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to learn optimal strategies.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The project should include a training phase where the AI learns through self-play and a subsequent evaluation phase to assess performance.
- **Adjustable Difficulty:** The project should allow for adjusting the difficulty of the AI opponent (e.g., through exploration rate or learning rate hyperparameters).
- **Real-time Game Play:** The AI must respond within the game's frame rate to provide a smooth player experience.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Saving and loading trained AI models.  Implementing a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Set up the development environment and choose a suitable game engine project.  If necessary, set up a simple game environment (e.g., Pong, simplified Snake).
2. **AI Implementation:** Implement the chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity).
3. **Training:** Train the AI using self-play for a predetermined number of iterations or time period.  Monitor performance metrics.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the trained AI into the game engine to control the opponent's actions.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the AI against human players and refine the hyperparameters or algorithm as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:** Training reinforcement learning models can be computationally intensive.  Consider simplifying the game or using a lightweight model to manage resources effectively within the time constraint.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm that balances complexity and performance is crucial given the time constraint.  Q-learning is recommended for its simplicity and efficiency.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Gain practical experience implementing and applying reinforcement learning techniques.
- **Game AI Development:** Learn how to integrate AI into game engines to create challenging opponents.
