# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control using PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, self-balancing robotic arm controlled using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.  The goal is to build a functional prototype demonstrating stable balancing and basic positional control within a short timeframe. This is a valuable exercise for understanding and implementing PID control, a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below)
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano (or similar)
* **Sensors:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU)
* **Actuators:** Servo motors (at least two)
* **Libraries:**  `PySerial` (for Arduino communication), `mpu6050` (for IMU data), potentially a PID control library.


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position despite external disturbances.
- **Position Control:** The arm should be able to move to a specified angle.
- **IMU Data Acquisition:**  Accurate reading and processing of accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050.
- **PID Implementation:**  Implementation of a PID controller to achieve precise balancing and control.
- **Serial Communication:** Effective communication between the Arduino and the Python control program.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Real-time Plotting:**  Visualize sensor data and control signals using Matplotlib.
- **User Interface:** A simple graphical interface to control arm position.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motors to the Arduino. Upload the necessary Arduino code to read IMU data and control servo positions based on initial PID gains (values can be approximated or sourced online for a similar setup).
2. **Python Control Program:** Write a Python script to communicate with the Arduino via serial.  This script will receive IMU data, calculate PID control signals, and send commands to the Arduino to adjust servo positions.
3. **PID Tuning:**  Experiment with PID gain values (P, I, D) to optimize the self-balancing performance.  Start with a simple proportional gain (P) and gradually add integral (I) and derivative (D) terms to improve stability and responsiveness.
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the arm's balancing capabilities and positional control.  Iteratively adjust PID gains to minimize oscillations and achieve desired performance.
5. **(Optional) Advanced Features:** Integrate real-time plotting and a user interface if time allows.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains requires careful experimentation and understanding of the system's dynamics.  Oscillations or instability can occur if the gains are poorly chosen.  Strategies like Ziegler-Nichols method can be used.
- **Sensor Noise:** The IMU data might contain noise, affecting the accuracy of the control system.  Appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** This project provides hands-on experience in implementing and tuning PID controllers, a crucial skill in robotics and automation.
- **Real-time Systems:**  Understanding the challenges and techniques involved in developing and implementing real-time control systems.
