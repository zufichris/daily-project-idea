# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on creating a functional AI within a short timeframe, emphasizing practical application of RL concepts. This allows for rapid prototyping and iterative improvement.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  A Q-learning or SARSA agent to learn optimal strategies.
- **Training Loop:**  A mechanism for the agent to play against itself and learn from experience.
- **Performance Evaluation:** A method to measure the AI's win rate against a simple rule-based opponent or a human player.
- **Data Visualization (Optional):**  Plotting the agent's win rate or Q-values over training iterations.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporating epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Saving and loading the trained model for future use.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a game environment using either OpenAI Gym or a custom Python class. Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:**  Implement a Q-learning or SARSA agent. Define the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a loop where the agent plays multiple games against itself, updating its Q-values based on the rewards received.
4. **Evaluation:**  Test the trained agent against a random opponent or a human player to assess its performance.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** Plot the agent's learning curve (win rate vs. training iterations).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal values for the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate may require experimentation.  Start with common defaults and adjust based on performance.
- **Computational Cost:** For more complex games, training the agent might take longer than a couple of days. Focus on a simple game (Tic-Tac-Toe) to ensure completion within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:**  Gain practical experience implementing Q-learning or SARSA algorithms.
- **Agent Design and Evaluation:**  Learn how to design, train, and evaluate an AI agent in a simple game environment.
