# Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple inverse kinematics solver for a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).  The solver will take a desired end-effector position (x, y, z coordinates) as input and calculate the corresponding joint angles required to reach that position. This is a fundamental problem in robotics with practical applications in automated manufacturing, surgery, and more.  The focus will be on a fast, efficient solution suitable for real-time control.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), SciPy (for optimization algorithms), Matplotlib (for visualization - optional)


## Features & Requirements

- **Input:** Accept desired (x, y, z) coordinates of the end-effector.
- **Calculation:** Implement an iterative numerical method (e.g., Newton-Raphson or Jacobian transpose) to solve the inverse kinematics equations.
- **Output:** Display the calculated joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) for each joint.
- **Error Handling:**  Gracefully handle cases where the desired position is unreachable.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Create a simple 2D or 3D visualization of the robotic arm to show the calculated configuration.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Add support for different robotic arm configurations (e.g., change link lengths).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a collision detection algorithm to prevent self-collisions of the robotic arm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Robot Model:**  Establish the kinematic equations for a 3-DOF robotic arm (e.g., using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters). Define link lengths and other relevant parameters.
2. **Implement Inverse Kinematics Solver:** Choose a suitable iterative numerical method (e.g., Jacobian transpose method) and implement the algorithm in Python using NumPy.
3. **Input & Output:** Create functions to accept user input (x, y, z coordinates) and display the calculated joint angles.
4. **Testing & Validation:**  Test the solver with various desired positions and verify the accuracy of the calculated joint angles (e.g., by comparing against a known solution or simulating the forward kinematics).
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If time permits, create a simple visualization using Matplotlib to show the arm's movements.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Singularities:**  Certain configurations of the robotic arm might lead to singularities where the inverse kinematics solution is ill-defined or multiple solutions exist.  Handle these cases gracefully, potentially by providing error messages or choosing a solution based on a predefined criterion.
- **Numerical Stability:**  The iterative solver might not converge for all inputs or converge slowly. Experiment with different optimization parameters or consider alternative methods if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of robotic arm kinematics and inverse kinematics problem solving.
