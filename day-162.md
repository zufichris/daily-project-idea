#  Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with Webcam Feed

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simple yet effective real-time object detection and tracking system using a webcam feed.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball, a person) and track its movement across the camera's field of view. This project demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts and provides a foundation for more advanced applications like robotics control or augmented reality.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Framework (Optional):** TensorFlow Lite (for faster inference if pre-trained model is used)
- **Tools:**  Webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object in the webcam feed using a suitable algorithm (e.g., Haar cascades, YOLOv5).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across frames using a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, simple centroid tracking).
- **Visual Feedback:** Display bounding boxes around the detected object and potentially its trajectory on the webcam feed.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Display frames per second (FPS) to evaluate the system's performance.
- **Object Classification (Optional):**  Extend detection to classify the detected object into different categories.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy). Verify webcam connectivity.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement object detection using a chosen algorithm (Haar cascades for simple objects, pre-trained YOLOv5 for more complex ones). Load a pre-trained model if using a deep learning approach.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a tracking algorithm to follow the detected object's movement across frames.  Maintain a history of object positions.
4. **Visualization:** Display the webcam feed with bounding boxes and potentially a trajectory line overlaid. Show FPS in a corner of the display.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with varying lighting conditions and object positions. Adjust parameters (e.g., thresholds) to optimize performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms. Deep learning models might require optimization (e.g., quantization) for real-time performance on less powerful hardware.
- **Occlusion Handling:** Dealing with scenarios where the object is temporarily obscured. Robust tracking algorithms are needed to handle these situations.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Reinforce understanding of object detection, tracking, and image processing techniques.
- **OpenCV Proficiency:** Gain practical experience using OpenCV for real-time video processing and manipulation.
