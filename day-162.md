# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robotic Scene Understanding

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple yet effective AI-powered image captioning system that can be integrated with a robotic platform (simulated or real) to enhance its scene understanding capabilities.  The goal is to generate human-readable descriptions of images captured by a robot's camera, aiding in navigation, object recognition, and task execution. This is a simplified version focusing on speed of prototyping.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for pre-trained model loading and inference),  transformers (for text generation)
- Pre-trained Model: A lightweight, readily available image captioning model (e.g., a distilled version of a larger model like  ViT-B/32 with a decoder).
- Optional: ROS (Robot Operating System) for robotic integration (if using a real robot).


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition and Preprocessing:**  Load an image (either from a file or a simulated camera feed). Resize and preprocess it for the chosen pre-trained model.
- **Caption Generation:** Use a pre-trained image captioning model to generate a text caption describing the image content.
- **Output Display:** Display the original image alongside the generated caption.
- **Basic Evaluation:**  Implement a simple mechanism to measure the length and coherence of the generated captions (e.g., word count and perplexity).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for potential issues like invalid image formats or model loading failures.

- **Advanced Features:** Integration with a simulated or real robotic environment (ROS).
- **Optional Feature:** Sentiment analysis of the generated caption to determine the "emotional state" of the scene (e.g., cluttered, organized, dangerous).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained image captioning model.
2. **Image Input and Preprocessing:** Implement image loading, resizing, and preprocessing steps compatible with the chosen model.
3. **Caption Generation:** Integrate the pre-trained model and use it to generate captions for test images.
4. **Output and Display:** Create a user interface (simple console or GUI) to display the image and generated caption.
5. **Basic Evaluation (optional):**  Implement a basic evaluation metric based on caption length and coherence.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Selection:** Choosing a suitable pre-trained model that balances accuracy and inference speed is crucial for a daily challenge. Overly complex models may take too long to run.
- **Computational Resources:**  Depending on the chosen model, sufficient computational resources might be needed.  Consider using cloud computing if needed.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of skills in using pre-trained deep learning models for a practical application.
- Experience in integrating AI components (image captioning) into a robotic or simulated robotic environment.
