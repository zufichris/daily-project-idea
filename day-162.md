# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a miniature self-balancing robotic arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller.  The arm will maintain a stable upright position despite external disturbances. This provides a practical, miniaturized example of applying PID control, a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems. The project's scope is limited to a simple arm, making it achievable within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 also viable).
* **Servo Motor:** A standard hobby servo motor with sufficient torque.
* **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** MPU6050 or similar, for measuring angle and angular velocity.
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Libraries:** Servo.h (for servo control), MPU6050.h (for IMU data acquisition).


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position using feedback from the IMU.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A PID controller should be implemented to manage the servo motor's position to achieve balance.
- **Calibration Routine:**  A simple calibration routine to account for variations in the servo's zero position and IMU offsets.
- **Manual Control (Optional):** Ability to override the PID controller and manually control the arm's position.
- **Real-time Feedback (Optional):**  Visualization of the arm's angle and PID control outputs (e.g., using a serial monitor).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the servo motor, IMU, and microcontroller. Verify all connections and power supply.
2. **IMU Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Implement code to read and calibrate the IMU data, obtaining accurate angle measurements.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement the PID controller algorithm to adjust the servo motor's position based on the IMU data. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) experimentally for optimal performance.
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the self-balancing functionality. Adjust the PID gains iteratively to achieve stable equilibrium.
5. **Optional Features (if time permits):**  Implement manual control or real-time feedback visualization.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with low gains and gradually increase them.
- **Noise in IMU Data:** IMU readings can be noisy.  Employ filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) to reduce noise and improve stability.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of PID Control:** Gain hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller for a real-world system.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Reinforce skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time control.
