# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and showcasing the core concepts of RL in a concise application.  This will demonstrate the power of RL in creating intelligent agents without explicit programming of game strategies.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Libraries: `gym`, `stable-baselines3` (or a similar RL library)
- IDE:  VS Code, PyCharm (or similar)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An RL agent trained using a chosen algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization).
    - An evaluation system to measure the AI's performance against a random agent or a simple heuristic-based agent.
    - Basic visualization of the game state and agent's actions.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementation of different RL algorithms for comparison.
    - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize agent performance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment using the `gym` library. This involves specifying the state space, action space, and reward structure.
2. **Agent Selection & Training:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO from `stable-baselines3`) and train the agent on the game environment.  Focus on a short training period suitable for a daily challenge.
3. **Evaluation:** Implement a function to evaluate the trained agent's performance against a baseline (random or simple heuristic agent).
4. **Visualization:** Add basic visualization to display the game state and the agent's actions during training and evaluation.
5. **Performance Analysis & Reporting:** Analyze the agent's performance metrics (e.g., win rate, average reward) and document the findings.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Training Time:** RL algorithms can be computationally expensive.  Careful selection of the algorithm and hyperparameters is crucial to achieve reasonable performance within the time constraint.  Consider simpler environments or reduced training iterations if necessary.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A well-designed reward function is essential for effective RL training.  Poorly designed rewards can lead to unexpected agent behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of fundamental Reinforcement Learning concepts (e.g., state, action, reward, policy).
- Gain practical experience in implementing and training an RL agent using a popular library like `stable-baselines3`.
