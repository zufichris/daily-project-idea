# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to create an AI that can learn optimal strategies within a limited timeframe, showcasing the power of reinforcement learning in a concise application.  This provides a practical demonstration of RL concepts without requiring extensive computational resources or time.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An AI agent using a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
    - Ability to train the AI agent against a random opponent or a pre-defined strategy.
    - Real-time display of the game state and AI's actions.
    - Basic performance metrics (e.g., win rate).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    - User interface allowing human interaction with the game.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment using a suitable library like Gym or create a custom environment in Python.  This involves defining the game state, actions, rewards, and termination conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent. This includes defining the state-action space, Q-table (or neural network for a DQN), and the update rule for learning.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop where the agent plays numerous games against a random or fixed opponent. Update the Q-table/network after each game based on the rewards received.
4. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance against a random opponent or a human player.
5. **Visualization:**  Present results through graphs and potentially a simple UI showing game progression and win/loss statistics.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing exploration and exploitation:**  Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions is crucial for effective learning.  This might require experimentation with different hyperparameters (e.g., epsilon-greedy strategy).
- **Convergence speed:**  Achieving satisfactory performance within a limited timeframe might necessitate careful selection of the algorithm and its parameters.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals:  This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and applying a basic RL algorithm.
- Agent design and training:  Participants will learn about designing agents, managing the training process, and evaluating performance.
