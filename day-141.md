# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a simple, self-calibrating robotic arm control system using computer vision.  The goal is to develop a system that automatically adjusts the robotic arm's kinematic model based on real-time visual feedback, improving its accuracy and precision without manual calibration. This is a simplified version focusing on a single degree of freedom for a daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotics library (e.g., ROS, PyBullet for simulation, or a specific hardware library if using a real robot).
- Hardware (optional): A single-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, a webcam or camera.

## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Calibration:**  Calibrate the camera to obtain intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients).
- **Object Detection:** Detect a known object (e.g., a colored marker) in the camera's field of view using OpenCV's object detection capabilities.
- **Position Estimation:** Estimate the 3D position of the detected object in the camera's coordinate system.
- **Inverse Kinematics (Simplified):** Implement a simplified inverse kinematics solution for the single degree of freedom robotic arm to move the end-effector to the estimated object position.
- **Error Minimization (Iterative):**  Iteratively adjust the robotic arm's position based on the difference between the target position and the actual position observed by the camera.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more robust error correction algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Extend to a multi-degree-of-freedom robotic arm (if hardware allows).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera Calibration & Object Detection:** Calibrate the camera using a standard chessboard pattern and implement object detection for a colored marker.
2. **Position Estimation:**  Develop a function to estimate the 3D position of the marker using its 2D coordinates in the image and the camera's intrinsic parameters.
3. **Simplified Inverse Kinematics:** Implement a simple function to control the robotic arm's single degree of freedom based on the desired position (e.g., angle calculation based on distance).
4. **Control Loop:** Create a control loop that continuously detects the object, estimates its position, commands the robotic arm, and updates the arm's position based on feedback from the camera.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system and refine the parameters to minimize error.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Position Estimation:**  The accuracy of the position estimation heavily depends on the camera calibration and object detection accuracy.  Noise and lighting conditions can significantly affect the results.
- **Computational Efficiency:** The control loop needs to run in real-time, so efficiency is crucial. Optimizing the code for speed is essential.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of computer vision techniques (camera calibration, object detection, 3D position estimation).
- Practical experience with robotic arm control and implementation of simple inverse kinematics.
