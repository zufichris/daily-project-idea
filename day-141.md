# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts, rather than creating a highly polished game.  The significance lies in quickly experiencing the power and limitations of RL in a practical setting.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar, like RLlib)
- **Game Development Library:** Pygame (for simplicity and speed)
- **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Simple Game Mechanics:** A basic 2D game, such as Pong or a simplified version of Snake.
- **RL Agent:** An AI opponent controlled by a Stable Baselines3 algorithm (e.g., PPO or A2C).
- **Training Loop:** A clear method to train the RL agent through interaction with the game environment.
- **Real-time Gameplay:**  The AI should play the game in real-time against a human player (optional).
- **Performance Metrics:**  Track the agent's performance during training (e.g., average reward).

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple reward shaping technique to accelerate learning.
- **Optional Feature:** Visualization of the agent's Q-values or policy during gameplay.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create the basic game framework using Pygame.  Focus on simple, easily observable game states and actions.
2. **Environment Definition:**  Wrap the Pygame game into a Gym environment compatible with Stable Baselines3.  Define the observation space, action space, and reward function.
3. **Agent Training:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (PPO or A2C are good starting points) and train the agent for a set number of steps or until a satisfactory performance level is achieved.
4. **Gameplay Integration (Optional):** Integrate the trained agent into the game to play against a human player.
5. **Performance Analysis:** Analyze the training curves and gameplay to assess the agent's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining a good reward function that appropriately guides the agent's learning can be challenging. Careful consideration is needed to avoid undesired behaviors.
- **Training Time:**  Achieving satisfactory performance might require a longer training period than initially anticipated, especially for more complex game mechanics.  Adjust the training parameters accordingly.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with designing a simple RL environment, choosing an appropriate algorithm, and training an agent.
- **Gym Environment Creation:** Learn how to create a custom environment for RL algorithms using OpenAI Gym's interface.
