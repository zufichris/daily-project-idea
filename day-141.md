# Self-Balancing Robot Simulation with PID Control

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a 2D simulation of a self-balancing robot using Python and a suitable physics engine.  The goal is to implement and tune a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to stabilize the robot's upright position. This provides a practical demonstration of control system principles within a manageable timeframe.  The simulation allows for rapid iteration and experimentation without the complexities of physical hardware.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Physics Engine:** Pygame (simpler) or Pymunk (more advanced)
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **IDE:**  VS Code, PyCharm, or similar.


## Features & Requirements

- **Robot Model:** A simple 2D model of a robot with a base and an inverted pendulum.
- **Physics Simulation:** Accurate simulation of gravity and rotational inertia affecting the robot.
- **PID Controller Implementation:**  A functioning PID controller to adjust the motor forces based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
- **Visualization:**  Real-time graphical representation of the robot's movement within the Pygame window.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the robot's angle, angular velocity, and control signals over time for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Robot Model:** Create the robot model (rectangle for base, line for pendulum) and set up the Pygame/Pymunk environment. Define initial conditions (angle, velocity).
2. **Physics Integration:** Implement basic physics calculations (gravity, torque) to update the robot's state at each time step.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Design and implement the PID controller algorithm.  Initialize PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) with initial values.
4. **Simulation Loop:** Integrate physics and control within a main loop to update and render the robot's position continuously.
5. **Tuning & Testing:** Experiment with different PID gains to achieve stable balancing. Observe the robot's behavior and adjust the gains accordingly.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments. Starting with simple proportional control and gradually adding integral and derivative terms can simplify the process.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation depends on the chosen physics engine and the precision of the implemented physics equations.  Simpler approximations might be necessary for a one-day project.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID Control Principles:**  Practical application and understanding of how PID controllers work and their tuning parameters.
- **Experience with Physics-Based Simulation:**  Gain experience in creating and implementing a simple physics simulation using Pygame or Pymunk.
