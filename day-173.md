# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures performed in front of the camera and trigger corresponding actions, such as turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or initiating a specific smart home scene. This provides a hands-free and intuitive interaction method beyond voice control.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (for gesture recognition), a suitable smart home automation library (e.g., Home Assistant API).
- **Tools:**  A webcam, Python development environment (e.g., VS Code or PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm, closed fist, thumbs up).
- **Action Mapping:**  Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., open palm = lights on, closed fist = lights off, thumbs up = increase volume).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process the webcam feed in real-time to provide immediate feedback.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.
- **Configuration:** Allow easy customization of gesture-action mappings.

- **Advanced Features:** Integrate with a local smart home hub (e.g., Home Assistant) for wider control capabilities.
- **Optional Feature:** Implement a basic user training mechanism to improve the accuracy of gesture recognition for individual users.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, Home Assistant API if chosen).
2. **Gesture Capture & Processing:**  Use OpenCV to capture webcam feed and MediaPipe to detect and classify hand gestures.  Focus on a simplified model for rapid prototyping.
3. **Action Mapping & Execution:** Implement the logic to map recognized gestures to specific actions. If integrating with a smart home system, include appropriate API calls.
4. **User Interface (Optional):** Develop a simple interface (e.g., using Tkinter) to display recognized gestures and allow configuration of mappings.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and hand positions to identify limitations and refine the gesture recognition accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Consider using image preprocessing techniques (e.g., background subtraction or adaptive thresholding) to mitigate this.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Distinguishing between similar gestures can be challenging.  Careful selection of gestures and robust model training are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with image processing, object detection, and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Develop skills in interfacing with smart home APIs to control devices programmatically.
