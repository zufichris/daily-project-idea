# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera and WebRTC for communication.  The system will detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and track its position within the camera's field of view, sending the object's coordinates via WebRTC to a separate display interface.  This demonstrates a foundational application in areas like robotics (e.g., object following), surveillance, or AR/VR applications.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (Node.js for backend, browser-based JavaScript for frontend)
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow.js (for object detection), WebRTC (for real-time communication), Socket.IO (optional, for simpler communication management).
- **Tools:**  A web camera, a suitable text editor/IDE, Node.js runtime environment, npm or yarn.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should detect a predefined object in the camera feed using TensorFlow.js.
- **Object Tracking:**  Continuously track the detected object's centroid (center) coordinates.
- **WebRTC Communication:**  Transmit the object's coordinates in real-time to a separate webpage (viewer).
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the object detection bounding box on the camera feed and the tracked coordinates on the viewer page.
- **FPS Monitoring (optional):** Display frames per second (FPS) for performance analysis.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the development environment:** Install Node.js, npm, and necessary libraries (TensorFlow.js, WebRTC).
2. **Implement object detection:** Use a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model (or train a very small, simple model) to detect the target object and extract bounding box coordinates.
3. **Integrate WebRTC:** Create a WebRTC peer connection between the camera feed and the viewer page to transmit object coordinates.
4. **Develop the viewer:** Create a simple webpage to receive and display the transmitted coordinates.  Optionally add visualization of the coordinates on a separate canvas.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system, refine the object detection accuracy, and optimize the WebRTC connection for low latency.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time object detection can be computationally intensive.  Consider using a lightweight model or optimizing the code for performance.
- **Network Latency:** WebRTC connection might experience latency.  Implement error handling and potentially buffering mechanisms.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of real-time communication using WebRTC.
- Gain experience with integrating machine learning models (TensorFlow.js) into real-time applications.
