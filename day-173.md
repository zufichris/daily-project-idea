# Mini-Project: Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a webcam feed, leveraging WebRTC for efficient video streaming and a lightweight object detection model.  The significance lies in exploring the combination of browser-based technologies with computer vision for quick prototyping and deployment of real-time applications.  This avoids complex server-side infrastructure for a focused, daily challenge.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js for optional server-side components)
- **WebRTC Library:** Simple-peer or similar
- **Object Detection Model:**  TensorFlow.js with a pre-trained MobileNet SSD or similar lightweight model.
- **Frontend Framework (optional):** React, Vue, or similar for structured UI.
- **Tools:**  Visual Studio Code, Node Package Manager (npm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Webcam Feed:**  Capture and display the webcam feed using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Detect specific objects (e.g., faces, cars) in the webcam feed using a pre-trained model.
- **Object Tracking:**  Track identified objects across frames, highlighting them visually.
- **Basic UI:** Display the video feed and any detected objects.
- **Performance Monitoring:** (Optional) Display FPS (frames per second) to assess the performance.

- **Advanced Features:** Object Classification (beyond detection),  Distance Estimation (requires additional calibration).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up WebRTC:** Integrate a WebRTC library to establish a peer connection for webcam streaming (peer-to-peer or with a minimal signaling server).
2. **Load and Run Object Detection Model:** Load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model and configure it to process frames from the WebRTC stream.
3. **Implement Object Tracking:** Use a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter or centroid tracking) to maintain object identity across frames.
4. **Create UI:** Develop a basic HTML/CSS/JS interface to display the video feed, bounding boxes around detected objects, and optionally, the FPS.
5. **(Optional) Optimize Performance:** Experiment with different object detection models or adjust model parameters to improve performance and reduce latency.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Bottleneck:**  Balancing real-time processing with the computational demands of object detection might lead to low FPS.  This can be addressed by choosing a lightweight model, optimizing image preprocessing, and potentially employing Web Workers.
- **Object Tracking Accuracy:**  Accurate tracking can be challenging, especially with occlusions or fast-moving objects.  Exploring different tracking algorithms and refining parameters may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with WebRTC:** Gain hands-on experience in building real-time video applications using WebRTC.
- **Application of Deep Learning Models in the Browser:**  Understand how to integrate and utilize pre-trained deep learning models for real-time computer vision tasks within a browser environment.
