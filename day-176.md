# Minimax AI for a Simplified Game

## Overview

This project involves developing a Minimax AI algorithm to play a simplified version of a two-player game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four (with a reduced board size for time constraints). The goal is to create a functional AI opponent that can play optimally within the limitations of a single day's work.  This project focuses on implementing a core AI algorithm and demonstrating its effectiveness.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `numpy` (optional, for efficient array handling)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  Implementation of the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for improved efficiency.
    -  A simple game board representation (e.g., a list or NumPy array).
    -  A function to evaluate the game state (determining win/loss/draw).
    -  A user interface (CLI is sufficient for this scope) allowing a human to play against the AI.
    -  The AI should make optimal moves based on the Minimax algorithm.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Implementation of a heuristic function for more complex game states (if time allows).
    -  A graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Pygame.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Define the game rules, board representation, and win/loss/draw conditions in Python code.
2. **Minimax Implementation:** Implement the core Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.  Start with a recursive implementation.
3. **Game Logic:** Integrate the Minimax AI into the game loop, allowing the AI to make moves based on the algorithm's output.
4. **User Interface:** Create a simple command-line interface to allow a human player to interact with the game.
5. **Testing:** Test the AI thoroughly against human players and potentially against another instance of the AI to verify its optimal gameplay.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:**  For larger game boards, the Minimax algorithm can become computationally expensive.  Addressing this might involve simplifying the game or employing more advanced search techniques.
- **Heuristic Function Design:** If attempting the optional heuristic function, careful consideration must be given to the weighting of different game state factors to ensure effective AI play.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of the Minimax algorithm and its application in game AI.
- Practical experience in implementing and optimizing a recursive algorithm.
