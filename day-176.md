#  Predictive Maintenance Model for Simulated IoT Devices

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simplified predictive maintenance model for simulated IoT devices.  The goal is to ingest simulated sensor data, train a basic machine learning model to predict potential failures, and visualize the results within a day or two. This demonstrates core concepts in data science and IoT applications relevant to many industries.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
* **Simulated Data:**  A simple Python script generating time-series data (or a readily available dataset)
* **Optional:** Streamlit for a quick UI.


## Features & Requirements

- **Data Simulation:** Generate synthetic sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure) mimicking real-world IoT device readings.
- **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to predict device failure based on sensor data.
- **Failure Prediction:**  Output a probability of failure within a specified timeframe.
- **Visualization:**  Generate plots to showcase sensor data and predicted failure probability.
- **Threshold Alert:** Display a clear alert (e.g., via console) when the failure probability exceeds a predefined threshold.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporating time-series analysis techniques for improved model accuracy.
- **Advanced Features:** Implementing a basic alert system (e.g., email notification) for actual device failure predictions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Generation/Ingestion:** Create a Python script to generate simulated time-series data for 3-5 simulated devices with varying failure patterns. Or use a publicly available time-series dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering:**  Process the data; potentially creating new features (e.g., rolling averages, standard deviations of sensor readings).
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:** Train a chosen machine learning model.  Evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
4. **Prediction and Visualization:** Make predictions on new data and create visualizations to display the results.
5. **Alert System (Optional):** Implement a basic threshold-based alert system if time permits.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:**  Ensuring the simulated data is realistic enough to train a meaningful model can be challenging.  Focus on patterns reflecting real-world device degradation.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model and optimizing its hyperparameters for limited data can impact prediction accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Machine Learning Concepts:** This project will strengthen your understanding of model training, evaluation, and deployment within a practical context.
- **Experience with IoT Data Handling:** You will gain valuable experience in processing and analyzing time-series data commonly found in IoT applications.
