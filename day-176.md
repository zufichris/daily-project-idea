#  Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV.  The system will capture video from a webcam, detect objects within the frame, classify them using a pre-trained model, and display bounding boxes with labels around the identified objects. This is a valuable exercise for understanding computer vision fundamentals and applying them to a practical scenario.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)  - for pre-trained model loading.
- A webcam or video file.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Processing:**  Capture and process video frames from a webcam at a reasonable frame rate (at least 10 FPS).
- **Object Detection:**  Detect objects in each frame using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet-SSD, YOLOv5).
- **Object Classification:** Classify detected objects using the model's output.
- **Bounding Box Display:**  Draw bounding boxes around detected objects on the video frames with labels indicating the classification.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) achieved.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Object tracking across frames using techniques like Kalman filtering or DeepSORT.  Adding a user interface for model selection or parameter adjustment.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras). Download a suitable pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Video Capture & Preprocessing:**  Write code to capture video frames from the webcam or a video file.  Consider resizing frames for faster processing if needed.
3. **Object Detection & Classification:**  Load the pre-trained model and apply it to each frame to detect and classify objects.
4. **Bounding Box & Label Display:** Draw bounding boxes around detected objects and display the classification labels on the video frames.
5. **Output Display & FPS Calculation:** Display the processed video stream with bounding boxes and labels. Calculate and display the FPS.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  Processing high-resolution video frames in real-time can be computationally expensive.  Consider using a less computationally intensive model or reducing the frame resolution.
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the object detection and classification depends heavily on the chosen pre-trained model and the quality of the input data.  Experimentation with different models might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of OpenCV:** Practical application of OpenCV functions for video processing, object detection, and drawing.
- **Experience with pre-trained models:**  Learn how to integrate and utilize pre-trained deep learning models for computer vision tasks.
