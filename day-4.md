# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, wave) and translate them into commands to control smart home devices (simulated in this prototype). This addresses the growing demand for intuitive and contactless interaction with smart home technology.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation),  PyAutoGUI (for simulated control actions)
- **Hardware:** Webcam (any standard webcam will suffice)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  The system should accurately detect predefined hand gestures from the webcam feed in real-time.
- **Gesture-to-Command Mapping:**  Each recognized gesture should trigger a specific action, such as turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or pausing/playing media.
- **User Calibration:**  Allow for user-specific calibration to account for variations in hand size and lighting conditions.
- **Command Feedback:** Provide visual or auditory feedback confirming the successful recognition and execution of the command.
- **Basic Error Handling:**  Gracefully handle cases where gestures are not recognized or commands fail.

- **Advanced Features:**  Background subtraction to improve accuracy in cluttered environments.  Support for multiple users.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, connect the webcam, and collect a small dataset of images/videos for each gesture using OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:**  Utilize MediaPipe's pose estimation capabilities to extract relevant hand keypoints and train a simple classifier (e.g., using a pre-trained model or a lightweight custom model) to distinguish between gestures.
3. **Command Integration:**  Develop the logic to map recognized gestures to specific commands using PyAutoGUI or a similar library to simulate interactions with smart home devices (e.g., by simulating mouse clicks or keyboard presses).
4. **User Interface (UI):** Create a basic UI (even a simple terminal display) to show the recognized gestures and the executed commands.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions, iteratively improving the accuracy and robustness of the gesture recognition and command execution.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy and Robustness:** Achieving high accuracy in real-time gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in lighting, hand positions, and background clutter.  Consider techniques like background subtraction or more advanced machine learning models.
- **Latency:**  Minimizing latency between gesture execution and command response is crucial for a smooth user experience.  Optimizing code and using efficient libraries is key.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of computer vision techniques:** This project reinforces skills in image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning for real-time applications.
- **Hands-on experience with real-time system development:**  The project involves dealing with real-time constraints, optimizing performance, and handling potential errors in a dynamic environment.
