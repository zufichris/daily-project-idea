# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using simple hand gestures recognized via a webcam.  The focus is on creating a functional minimal viable product (MVP) that demonstrates the core concept within a short timeframe. This project showcases the integration of computer vision and IoT control, offering a unique and practical application of these technologies.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation),  a suitable library for controlling the target appliance (e.g., a library specific to the smart lamp's API).
* **Hardware:** Webcam, a smart home appliance with API access.
* **Tools:**  Visual Studio Code or similar IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:** The system should accurately recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., "wave" for on/off, "thumbs up" for brightness increase, "thumbs down" for brightness decrease).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Gesture recognition and appliance control should occur in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Appliance Control:**  The system must successfully send commands to the chosen smart appliance based on the recognized gestures.
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple UI (can be a console window initially) displaying the recognized gesture and the appliance's current status.
- **Calibration:** Allow for basic calibration to account for lighting conditions and individual hand sizes.

- **Advanced Features:** Integration with a voice assistant for alternative control methods.
- **Optional Feature:**  Support for multiple appliances.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe) and configure the development environment.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement the gesture recognition module using MediaPipe's pose estimation capabilities. Focus on the core 3 gestures.  Train a simple classifier if needed, but prioritize using existing MediaPipe features for speed.
3. **Appliance Control:**  Integrate the chosen smart appliance's API into the system to send control commands based on the recognized gestures.  Test thoroughly.
4. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI displaying recognized gestures and appliance status.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and hand positions. Refine gesture recognition parameters as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Explore image preprocessing techniques (e.g., adaptive thresholding) to mitigate this.
- **API Integration:** The specific API of the chosen smart appliance might present challenges.  Proper documentation and error handling are essential.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  This project reinforces understanding of real-time image processing, gesture recognition, and the practical application of computer vision libraries.
- **IoT Integration:** This project provides practical experience in integrating software with a physical device (smart appliance) via its API, showcasing basic IoT concepts.
