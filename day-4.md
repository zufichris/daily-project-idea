# Real-time Chatbot for Mental Health Awareness

## Overview
As mental health awareness becomes increasingly important, a chatbot can play a crucial role in providing emotional support and resources to individuals struggling with mental health issues. This project aims to design and develop a real-time chatbot that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to engage users in conversations about mental wellness.

## Technologies & Tools
* Programming languages: Python, JavaScript
* Frameworks: Flask for backend, React for frontend
* Libraries: NLTK for NLP, TensorFlow for machine learning
* Tools: Dialogflow for chatbot integration, MongoDB for data storage

## Features & Requirements
### Core Features:
1. User authentication and profiling to track conversations and provide personalized responses.
2. Natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to understand user inputs and respond accordingly.
3. Integration with mental health resources (e.g., crisis hotlines, therapy services) to offer support and guidance.

### Advanced/Optional Features:
1. Emotion detection using facial recognition or speech analysis to recognize users' emotional states.
2. Personalized recommendation engine for mental wellness apps, articles, or videos based on user interests and preferences.
3. Integration with popular social media platforms to share mental health resources and raise awareness.

## Implementation Plan
### Step 1: Set up the project structure and dependencies

* Install Flask and React using npm or yarn
* Create a new Dialogflow agent for chatbot integration
* Initialize MongoDB for data storage

### Step 2: Implement NLP capabilities

* Use NLTK to tokenize user inputs and analyze sentiment
* Train a machine learning model (e.g., TensorFlow) to classify user emotions and provide appropriate responses

### Step 3: Develop the chatbot interface

* Create a React app with a simple chat interface
* Integrate Dialogflow API to handle user input and generate responses

### Step 4: Implement authentication and profiling

* Use Flask-Login for user authentication
* Store user profiles in MongoDB, including conversation history and preferences

### Step 5: Integrate mental health resources

* Create a database of available resources (e.g., crisis hotlines, therapy services)
* Implement API calls to retrieve relevant information and provide it to users

## Challenges & Considerations
1. **Emotion detection**: Facial recognition or speech analysis can be challenging due to varying lighting conditions, facial expressions, or accents.
2. **Conversational flow**: Ensuring the chatbot's responses are coherent, empathetic, and informative while handling user input nuances will require significant testing.
3. **Data storage and scalability**: Designing a scalable database and handling data retrieval efficiently to support large-scale conversations will be crucial.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helps reinforce skills in:

* NLP and machine learning concepts (text analysis, sentiment detection)
* Chatbot development using Dialogflow and React
* Authentication and profiling with Flask-Login
* Database design and scalability considerations
* Best practices for user experience and conversational flow
