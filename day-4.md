# Efficient Pathfinding for a Simulated Mobile Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and testing an efficient pathfinding algorithm for a simulated mobile robot navigating a complex environment with obstacles. The goal is to create a system that quickly and reliably finds optimal paths, highlighting the trade-offs between different pathfinding algorithms.  This is significant for applications like warehouse automation, autonomous delivery systems, and robotics research.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NetworkX (for graph representation â€“ optional, but highly recommended for efficiency with complex maps), A* algorithm implementation (can be found readily online or implemented from scratch).
* **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).

## Features & Requirements

- **Map Generation:**  A simple 2D grid-based map with randomly placed obstacles.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implementation of the A* search algorithm.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the robot's movement, path, and obstacles using Pygame.
- **Path Optimization:** The algorithm should find the shortest path (or a near-optimal path) avoiding obstacles.
- **Performance Measurement:**  Basic timing to assess the algorithm's efficiency (time taken to find a path).

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implementation of a heuristic function other than Manhattan distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) for A*.
- **Optional Feature:**  Incorporating dynamic obstacles (obstacles that move during path execution).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Map Setup:** Create a function to generate a random 2D grid map with obstacles.  Use Pygame to display this map.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement or integrate an A* algorithm to find a path from a start point to a goal point on the map, avoiding obstacles.
3. **Path Visualization:**  Visualize the found path and the robot's movement on the Pygame map.
4. **Performance Testing:**  Measure the time taken to find a path for different map sizes and obstacle densities.
5. **Output:** Display the path and the time taken to find it.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Efficiency:**  A poorly implemented A* algorithm can be computationally expensive for large maps. Consider using heuristics and data structures efficiently.
- **Heuristic Selection:**  Choosing an appropriate heuristic function significantly impacts the algorithm's performance. Experimenting with different heuristics can be beneficial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Pathfinding Algorithms:**  This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and optimizing the A* search algorithm.
- **Software Engineering Practices:** This project reinforces good coding practices, such as modularity, testing, and performance analysis.
