# Robotic Arm Calibration & Control using Inverse Kinematics

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified inverse kinematics solution for a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).  The goal is to create a program that allows users to specify a target (x, y, z) coordinate and have the robotic arm automatically calculate and execute the necessary joint angles to reach that point. This will involve creating a calibration routine to map the physical arm's movements to the virtual model.  This project emphasizes practical application and streamlined code, focusing on core concepts rather than excessive complexity.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for inverse kinematics calculations), PySerial (for serial communication with the robotic arm controller, if using a physical arm; otherwise, a simulation library will be used).
- **Robotics Simulator (Optional):** V-REP, Gazebo, or a custom simulation environment.
- **Hardware (Optional):** A 3-DOF robotic arm with serial communication capabilities, power supply, and necessary drivers.

## Features & Requirements

- **Calibration Routine:**  A procedure to determine the relationship between joint angles and end-effector position.  This might involve manually moving the arm to known positions and recording the joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics Solver:**  An algorithm (e.g., geometric approach for 3 DOF) to calculate the joint angles required to reach a specified target coordinate.
- **Control Interface:** A simple interface (command line or basic GUI) to input target coordinates and initiate movement.
- **Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle unreachable targets or joint limit violations.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record target coordinates, calculated joint angles, and execution time.

- **Advanced Features:** Implementation of a Jacobian matrix-based iterative solution for improved accuracy.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a computer vision system to track a target and automatically adjust arm position.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Calibration:**  Develop a calibration routine to map joint angles to Cartesian coordinates.  If using a simulator, this can be simplified by defining the arm's kinematics model directly.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Algorithm:** Implement a geometric or iterative inverse kinematics algorithm for a 3-DOF robotic arm using NumPy and SciPy.
3. **Control Interface:** Create a basic command-line interface or a simple GUI to input (x, y, z) coordinates.
4. **Arm Control (Simulation or Real):**  Integrate the inverse kinematics solution with the robotic arm controller (using PySerial for physical hardware or simulated arm commands).
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system with various target points and adjust the calibration or algorithm as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Calibration Accuracy:** Achieving accurate calibration can be challenging, especially with real-world robotic arms due to mechanical imperfections. Careful measurements and iterative refinement are crucial.
- **Singularities:**  Addressing potential singularities in the robot's workspace where the inverse kinematics solution is undefined or ill-conditioned requires careful handling and potentially a more robust algorithm.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of robot kinematics:**  Gain practical experience in applying inverse kinematics algorithms and understanding the relationship between joint angles and end-effector position.
- **Improve proficiency in Python and relevant libraries:**  Enhance skills in using NumPy and SciPy for mathematical computations and PySerial or a simulation library for interacting with hardware or simulated environments.
