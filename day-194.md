# Smart Home Device Integration via MQTT Broker

## Overview

This project focuses on building a lightweight application that acts as a central hub for integrating multiple smart home devices using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol.  The goal is to demonstrate seamless communication and data aggregation from diverse devices without requiring proprietary APIs or cloud services.  This allows for greater control and privacy over smart home data.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with the `paho-mqtt` library)
- **MQTT Broker:**  Mosquitto (easily installable and lightweight)
- **Simulated Devices:**  Simple Python scripts simulating sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm (for ease of development and debugging)


## Features & Requirements

- **MQTT Broker Setup:**  Set up and configure a local Mosquitto MQTT broker.
- **Simulated Device Integration:**  Create and integrate at least two simulated devices (e.g., temperature sensor, light switch) that publish data to the MQTT broker.
- **Data Aggregation:**  Develop the central hub application to subscribe to topics from the simulated devices and aggregate the received data.
- **Basic Data Visualization:**  Display the aggregated data in a simple console-based interface (or a rudimentary GUI using a library like `Tkinter`).
- **Command and Control (Optional):**  Allow the central hub to publish commands to control simulated devices (e.g., turn a light on/off).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Broker Setup:** Install and start the Mosquitto MQTT broker.
2. **Simulated Device Creation:** Write Python scripts to simulate two different devices, each publishing data to unique MQTT topics.
3. **Central Hub Development:** Develop the main Python application to subscribe to the device topics, receive data, aggregate it, and display it.
4. **Data Visualization:** Implement a basic console output or a simple GUI to visualize the aggregated data.
5. **(Optional) Command and Control:**  Add functionality for the hub to publish commands to control the simulated devices.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Error Handling:** Robustly handling connection issues, message parsing errors, and potential data inconsistencies from the simulated devices will be crucial. This involves incorporating appropriate exception handling mechanisms in the Python code.
- **Data Rate & Buffering:**  Depending on the frequency of data publication from the simulated devices, the central hub may need to handle a high data rate.  Implementing a buffer or queuing system might be necessary for smoother operation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **MQTT Protocol:** This project reinforces understanding of the MQTT protocol, including topics, subscriptions, publishing, and message queuing.
- **Data Aggregation and Visualization:**  The project strengthens skills in data aggregation, processing, and basic data visualization techniques in a real-world context.
