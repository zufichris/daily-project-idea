# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with Web Camera

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a standard web camera and readily available computer vision libraries.  The system will identify and track a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view, displaying its location and potentially its classification with bounding boxes. This project showcases fundamental computer vision techniques within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (optional for classification), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A web camera (any standard USB webcam will suffice)

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video frames from the web camera at a reasonable frame rate.
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a specific object (pre-defined color or shape) within each frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across consecutive frames.  This can be done using simple correlation or more sophisticated methods.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object on the displayed video feed.
- **Basic Performance Metrics:** Display the frames per second (FPS) achieved.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Object classification using a pre-trained model (e.g., TensorFlow Lite model for mobile deployment).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a more robust tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) to handle occlusions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Video Capture:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy), initialize the web camera, and capture video frames.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm (e.g., thresholding based on HSV color space) or shape detection (e.g., using contours).  Focus on the chosen object (e.g., a red ball).
3. **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object across frames using simple methods (e.g., comparing the object's centroid location between frames).
4. **Bounding Box and Display:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object and display the resulting video stream with the bounding box overlaid.
5. **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display the frames per second (FPS) to evaluate the system's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing can be computationally intensive.  Consider optimizing the algorithm and reducing image resolution if needed to maintain a reasonable FPS.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracking algorithm might struggle if the object is temporarily occluded.  A more robust tracking algorithm (optional advanced feature) can address this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of:**  Basic computer vision concepts like image processing, color spaces (HSV), and object detection.
- **Gain practical experience with:** OpenCV library for video processing, real-time applications, and performance optimization.
