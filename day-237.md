# Self-Optimizing PID Controller for a Simulated Robotic Arm

## Overview
This project focuses on developing and testing a self-optimizing Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated robotic arm.  The goal is to achieve precise and efficient control of the arm's movement, even with varying loads and environmental factors, by implementing a simple self-tuning algorithm within a limited timeframe.  This will demonstrate a practical application of control systems theory and highlight the benefits of adaptive control in robotics.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
* **Simulation Environment:** PyBullet (or a similar physics engine)
* **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements
- **Basic PID Control:** Implement a standard PID controller to control a single joint of the simulated robotic arm.
- **Setpoint Tracking:**  The arm should accurately track a specified target angle.
- **Real-time Simulation:** The controller should operate within the simulation environment, providing feedback based on simulated sensor data.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Record and display key performance indicators like settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error.
- **Simple Self-Tuning:** Implement a basic self-tuning mechanism (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method or a simplified auto-tuning approach) to adjust the PID gains based on initial performance.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Add noise to the simulated sensor data to simulate real-world sensor inaccuracies.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a multi-joint control system (if time allows).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Simulation:** Set up the PyBullet environment and create a simple robotic arm model.  Define the control system architecture.
2. **Basic PID Implementation:** Implement the basic PID controller logic and integrate it with the simulation. Test the controller with a simple setpoint tracking task.
3. **Performance Evaluation:**  Evaluate the controller's performance, recording relevant metrics.  Identify areas for improvement based on the initial results.
4. **Self-Tuning Algorithm:** Implement a simple self-tuning algorithm (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method) to automatically adjust the PID gains based on the performance observed in step 3.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the self-optimizing controller with varying setpoints, loads (if simulated), and potentially added noise. Refine the tuning algorithm based on observations.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Tuning the Self-Tuning Algorithm:** Finding the optimal parameters for the self-tuning algorithm can be challenging.  A simplified or iterative approach is recommended for this time constraint.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation directly impacts the controller's performance.  Care must be taken to ensure the simulation realistically models the physical system.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of PID Control Theory:** This project solidifies understanding of PID controller design and tuning.
- **Practical Application of Adaptive Control:**  Experience with implementing and evaluating a self-optimizing control system, a crucial aspect of advanced robotics.
