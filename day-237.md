# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Webcam

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The system will identify and track a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view, providing visual feedback (bounding box and label) on the object's location. This is a valuable exercise for understanding computer vision fundamentals and integrating different libraries efficiently.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (or a similar lightweight model zoo), NumPy
- **Tools:** A webcam, a suitable development environment (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Processing:**  Process webcam frames at a reasonable frame rate (at least 10 FPS).
- **Object Detection:** Detect the pre-defined object within each frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the object's movement across consecutive frames.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display a bounding box and label around the detected object on the video feed.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Optionally, calculate and display the tracking accuracy (e.g., IoU).


- **Advanced Features:** Implementing a more robust tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) for smoother tracking in case of occlusions.
- **Advanced Features:** Support for multiple object tracking.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy).  Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a lightweight MobileNet SSD model) or train a simple model for the target object.
2. **Webcam Integration:**  Access the webcam feed using OpenCV.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Process each frame, run object detection using the loaded model, and implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using centroid tracking).
4. **Visualization:** Draw bounding boxes and labels on the video feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Refinement:** Test, optimize for performance (frame rate), and improve the accuracy of the object detection and tracking as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  Balancing real-time processing with the complexity of the object detection model. Using a lightweight model is crucial.
- **Occlusion Handling:**  The tracker might lose track of the object if it becomes occluded. Implementing a more sophisticated tracking algorithm could mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with real-time video processing, object detection, and tracking.
- **Library Integration:** Improve skills in integrating and utilizing different libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras) effectively for a specific task.
