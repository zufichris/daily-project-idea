#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration & Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, self-calibrating control system for a miniature robotic arm (e.g., a 3-DOF robotic arm kit). The goal is to create a software interface allowing for precise control and automatic calibration of the arm's position, demonstrating fundamental robotics concepts in a concise timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with NumPy and SciPy for numerical computation)
* **Framework/Library:** Robot Operating System (ROS) - lightweight implementation (or a simplified kinematic model if ROS is considered too extensive for the time frame)
* **Hardware:** Miniature 3-DOF robotic arm kit (e.g., from Adafruit, SparkFun), Arduino or similar microcontroller, motor drivers.
* **Software Tools:**  A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text), Terminal/Command Prompt.

## Features & Requirements

- **Inverse Kinematics Solver:**  Calculate the required joint angles to reach a given Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z).
- **Motor Control:**  Send commands to the motors to achieve desired joint angles using PWM signals via the microcontroller.
- **Basic GUI:**  A simple interface (using Tkinter or a similar Python library) to set target coordinates.
- **Self-Calibration Routine:**  A procedure to automatically adjust the model parameters to compensate for minor manufacturing imperfections.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Display the current joint angles and end-effector position on the GUI.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a basic path planning algorithm (e.g., linear interpolation) to move the arm along a sequence of points.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add obstacle avoidance using proximity sensors.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup & Driver Integration:** Connect the robotic arm, microcontroller, and motor drivers. Test motor control using basic commands.  This may require pre-existing driver code.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Implementation:** Develop a function in Python to solve the inverse kinematics problem for the specific arm geometry.  Use simplified models if needed to manage time constraints.
3. **GUI Development:** Create a basic interface to input target (x, y, z) coordinates and display feedback.
4. **Calibration Routine:** Develop a simple procedure (e.g., moving to known positions and adjusting model parameters based on error) to calibrate the armâ€™s position.
5. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate all components, test the system using various target coordinates, and refine the calibration routine.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Inverse Kinematics Complexity:**  Solving the inverse kinematics equations can be computationally intensive, especially for more complex arm designs.  Simplified models should be employed to avoid spending excessive time on mathematical complexities.
- **Calibration Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in calibration may require iterative adjustments and fine-tuning of the model parameters.  Focus on a functional, rather than highly precise calibration method.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of robot kinematics and control:** This project provides practical experience in implementing inverse kinematics and controlling robotic actuators.
- **Gain familiarity with ROS (or similar) framework:**  Working with ROS (even a lightweight implementation) exposes the developer to fundamental concepts in robot software architecture.
