# Mini-Max AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project involves building a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Minimax AI opponent and a graphical user interface (GUI).  The Minimax algorithm will ensure the AI plays optimally, never losing and always winning or drawing against a human player. The visual aspect will enhance user engagement and understanding of the AI's decision-making process.  This is a classic AI problem ideal for a short development sprint, allowing for exploration of game AI and GUI implementation within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **GUI Framework:** Pygame (or similar, like Tkinter for a simpler GUI)
* **Libraries:**  Potentially NumPy for array manipulation (depending on implementation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Playable Game:**  A functional Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human can play against the AI.
- **Minimax AI:** The AI opponent must utilize the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- **GUI:** A visual representation of the game board with clear indication of whose turn it is.
- **Win/Draw Detection:** Accurate detection and display of win or draw conditions.
- **Move Visualization (Optional):**  Highlight the AI's chosen move before making it.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Display the Minimax search tree (partially or fully, depending on complexity) to visualize the AI's decision process.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Allow the user to choose between playing against the AI (Minimax) or another human player.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the game board and GUI:** Create the visual representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board using Pygame.  Implement basic drawing functions for X's and O's.
2. **Implement player input:** Allow human players to make moves by clicking on the board.  Validate the moves to ensure they are legal.
3. **Implement the Minimax algorithm:** Write the recursive Minimax function to determine the best move for the AI.  This is the core challenge of the project.
4. **Integrate the AI with the game:**  Incorporate the Minimax function into the game loop, allowing the AI to make moves after the human player.
5. **Add win/draw detection and display:**  Implement logic to check for win or draw conditions and display the appropriate message on the GUI.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:** Correctly implementing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning (optional, but recommended for efficiency) is the most challenging aspect. Debugging recursive functions can be time-consuming.
- **GUI responsiveness:**  Ensuring the GUI remains responsive even during complex AI calculations might require optimization techniques, especially if visualizing the search tree.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Algorithm Design:**  Implementing the Minimax algorithm reinforces understanding of recursive algorithms and game theory concepts.
- **GUI Development Practice:**  Building the GUI provides practical experience in using a GUI framework like Pygame, enhancing skills in visual programming.
