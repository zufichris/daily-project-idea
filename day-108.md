# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a simplified intelligent traffic light system using a chosen programming language. The goal is to develop a basic simulation that dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle density at each intersection. This provides a practical introduction to algorithm design and simulation techniques relevant to autonomous systems and smart city infrastructure.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python (with libraries NumPy and Matplotlib are recommended)
- IDE:  VS Code or PyCharm
- Libraries:  NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for visualization), potentially a simple queueing library.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Simulation:** Simulate vehicle arrival and departure at intersections using a random number generator, modelling traffic flow with a basic queuing system.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., fixed-time, or a rudimentary adaptive algorithm based on vehicle counts at each intersection).
- **Visualization:** Display the traffic flow and traffic light states graphically using Matplotlib.  Visualize vehicle queues, waiting times, and traffic light cycles.
- **Data Logging:** Record key metrics (e.g., average waiting time, throughput) for analysis.
- **Basic Intersection Model:** Model at least two intersections connected by a single road with a single lane in each direction


## Implementation Steps
1. **Model Setup:** Define the simulation parameters (number of vehicles, arrival rates, intersection geometry). Create data structures (queues) to represent vehicles waiting at each intersection.
2. **Traffic Light Control Algorithm:** Implement a basic traffic light control algorithm (e.g., fixed-time or a simple adaptive algorithm that switches based on queue lengths).
3. **Simulation Loop:** Create a main loop that simulates vehicle arrival, movement, and traffic light switching. Update vehicle queues and visualize the traffic flow in real time.
4. **Data Collection and Logging:** Collect relevant metrics (e.g., waiting times, throughput).  Store this data in a simple CSV or JSON file for later analysis.
5. **Visualization Refinement:** Refine the Matplotlib plots to show a clear and informative representation of the simulation (e.g., clear labeling, color-coded queues).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm Complexity:** Balancing the simplicity of the algorithm with the realism of the simulation is challenging.  An overly complex algorithm will take longer to implement.
- **Visualization Optimization:** Efficiently visualizing a dynamic simulation with multiple vehicles and intersections may require careful consideration of plotting techniques.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Algorithm Design and Implementation:**  Practicing the design and implementation of a basic control algorithm within a real-world scenario.
- **Simulation Techniques:** Gain experience building and visualizing a discrete event simulation model.  Learn how to model stochastic processes (random vehicle arrivals).
