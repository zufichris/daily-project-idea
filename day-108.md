# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection controlled by an intelligent traffic light system.  The simulation will use a basic agent-based model to adjust traffic light timings based on detected vehicle density in each approach. This project focuses on demonstrating the core principles of intelligent traffic management and provides a foundation for more complex simulations.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `pygame` (for visualization), `numpy` (for numerical computation), `random` (for traffic generation).
* **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Generation:**  Randomly generate vehicles approaching the intersection from each direction at variable rates.
- **Vehicle Detection:**  Simulate vehicle detection using simple counting mechanisms within defined zones.
- **Traffic Light Control:**  Implement a basic algorithm to adjust traffic light timings based on detected vehicle counts (e.g., prioritize the direction with the highest queue).
- **Visualization:**  Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light states using `pygame`.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Track metrics like average waiting time and throughput.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated traffic light control algorithm (e.g., a fuzzy logic controller) that considers both vehicle density and arrival rates.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add different vehicle types (cars, trucks) with varying speeds and lengths.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Initialization:** Set up the `pygame` window, define the intersection geometry, and initialize variables for vehicle counts and traffic light states.
2. **Traffic Generation:** Implement vehicle generation logic, assigning random speeds and directions to each vehicle.
3. **Vehicle Movement and Detection:**  Move vehicles across the simulation, counting vehicles within detection zones.
4. **Traffic Light Control:** Implement the basic traffic light control algorithm, adjusting timings based on vehicle counts.
5. **Visualization and Metrics:** Display the simulation using `pygame` and record performance metrics such as average waiting time.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Design:** Designing an effective and efficient traffic light control algorithm within the time constraints. This might involve starting with a simple algorithm and iteratively refining it.
- **Visualization Performance:**  Ensuring smooth visualization performance with a high density of vehicles might require optimization techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of agent-based modeling concepts.
- Practical experience in using Python libraries for simulation and visualization.
