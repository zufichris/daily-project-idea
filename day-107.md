# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple computer vision system for calibrating a robotic arm's end-effector position.  The system will use a known target (e.g., a colored marker) and a camera to determine the precise location of the robotic arm's gripper relative to the camera. This is a crucial step in many robotic applications, ensuring accurate and repeatable movements.  The focus will be on a rapid prototyping approach suitable for a short timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), possibly a robotic arm control library (depending on the specific arm used).
- Tools: A camera (webcam or dedicated camera), a robotic arm (even a small, inexpensive one will suffice), a colored marker.


## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) using a standard chessboard pattern.
- **Target Detection:** Detect the colored marker in the camera image using color filtering and contour detection.
- **Position Calculation:** Calculate the 2D coordinates of the marker in the camera image.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Transform the 2D image coordinates to 3D world coordinates using the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (assuming a known camera-world transformation).
- **Robotic Arm Control (optional):** Send the calculated 3D coordinates to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the target location.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a robust error handling mechanism to deal with cases where the marker is not detected.
- **Advanced Features:** Integrate a simple user interface for setting parameters and visualizing results.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function with a chessboard pattern to obtain camera intrinsic parameters.
2. **Marker Detection:** Implement color filtering and contour detection to locate the marker in the camera's live feed.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:**  Use a pre-defined or estimated camera-world transformation matrix to convert the 2D image coordinates of the marker into 3D world coordinates.  Simplifications can be made (e.g., assuming a simple camera-world orientation).
4. **Position Calculation & Visualization:** Display the calculated 3D position on the screen.
5. **Robotic Arm Control (optional):** Send the calculated 3D coordinates to the robotic arm's control system to move the end-effector to the target position.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy:**  Achieving high accuracy in position calculation may be challenging due to noise in the image and potential errors in the camera calibration and transformation.  Focus on a simplified approach for the daily challenge.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Processing the camera feed and controlling the robotic arm in real-time might be computationally expensive.  Consider using simpler algorithms and optimizing code for speed.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce practical skills in computer vision techniques like camera calibration and object detection.
- Gain experience in coordinate transformations and integrating computer vision with robotics.
