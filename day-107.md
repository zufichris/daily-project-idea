# AI-Powered Real-time Object Classification & Tracking for a Simulated Robot Arm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic AI system that can classify and track objects in real-time within a simulated environment, using this information to command a simulated robotic arm.  This provides a simplified, yet challenging, way to explore computer vision and robotics control integration.  The simulation allows for rapid iteration and testing without the need for physical hardware.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (machine learning), PyBullet (physics simulation and robotics), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm),  a virtual environment (conda or venv)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should detect and classify objects (e.g., cubes, spheres) within a PyBullet simulated scene using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5).
- **Object Tracking:** The system should track identified objects as they move within the scene, maintaining their location in real-time.
- **Robotic Arm Control:**  A simulated robotic arm (provided by PyBullet) should receive commands to pick up and manipulate detected objects based on their tracked position.
- **Basic Scene Interaction:** The robot should be able to pick up an object and place it in a designated location.
- **GUI (Optional):** A basic graphical user interface to visualize the scene and control parameters.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Create a Python virtual environment and install the required libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, PyBullet, NumPy).
2. **Simulate Scene & Robot Arm:** Load a pre-built PyBullet scene containing objects and a robotic arm.
3. **Implement Object Detection & Tracking:** Integrate a pre-trained object detection model (or a simpler model like Haar cascades for a quicker prototype) and implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter or simple centroid tracking).
4. **Develop Robotic Arm Control:**  Write the code to command the robotic arm based on the location of tracked objects (using inverse kinematics if available in the chosen robot model or simpler positional control).
5. **Integrate and Test:** Combine the detection, tracking, and control components to demonstrate the system's ability to pick up and move objects.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Performance:** Achieving real-time performance with object detection and control can be challenging, requiring efficient algorithms and potentially hardware acceleration.  Consider simplifying the model or reducing image resolution if necessary.
- **Accurate Object Tracking:** Robust tracking in a dynamic environment can be difficult.  Dealing with occlusions and object movement requires a sophisticated tracking algorithm. Explore different tracking algorithms for optimal results within the time constraint.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision Concepts:** This project will solidify understanding of object detection, image processing, and object tracking.
- **Practical Application of Robotics Control:** Learners will gain practical experience in controlling a simulated robot arm based on sensory input (computer vision data).
