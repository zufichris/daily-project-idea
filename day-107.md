# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for a simulated or physical self-balancing robot. The goal is to create a stable, self-righting robot that maintains its upright position despite disturbances.  This project emphasizes practical application of control systems theory and iterative improvement through parameter tuning.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID controller implementation and numerical calculations), Pygame (optional, for simulation visualization)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino or similar microcontroller, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), motor drivers, motors, a physical robot chassis.  Simulation can be used if hardware is unavailable.

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balance:** The robot maintains its upright position when undisturbed.
- **Self-Righting:** The robot recovers from small disturbances (e.g., a gentle push).
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A functional PID controller adjusts motor speeds based on sensor data.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The robot reacts to changes in its orientation in real-time.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Adjustable PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) allow for optimization of the robot's stability.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implementation of a Kalman filter for noise reduction in sensor data.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Visual feedback through a camera and image processing (requires additional hardware and libraries).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Sensor Data Acquisition:**  If using a physical robot, read angle and angular velocity data from the IMU. For simulation, generate synthetic sensor data.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement the PID algorithm in Python using NumPy or SciPy.  Initialize PID gains with reasonable starting values.
3. **Motor Control:**  Send control signals to the motors based on the PID controller's output.  For simulation, update the robot's state based on the calculated motor commands.
4. **Testing and Tuning:**  Test the robot's stability and adjust the PID gains iteratively to achieve optimal performance (minimum oscillations, fast settling time).
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If using Pygame, create a simple visual representation of the robot's motion and sensor data.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require several iterations of testing and adjustment.  Start with conservative values and gradually increase them.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world sensor data often contains noise, which can affect the performance of the PID controller.  Consider using filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman filter).


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:**  Reinforces understanding of PID controllers and their practical application in control systems.
- **Iterative Development:**  Emphasizes the importance of testing, iteration, and parameter tuning in developing robust control systems.
