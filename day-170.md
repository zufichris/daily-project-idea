# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it. The game will be sufficiently simple to allow for significant progress in a day or two, focusing on demonstrating core RL concepts. The agent's learning process and performance will be visualized.  This project emphasizes practical application of RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Engine:**  A simple 2D game (e.g., a maze navigation game or a simple platformer with a single enemy).
- **RL Agent:** An agent trained using Q-learning or a simpler RL algorithm to navigate and achieve a goal (e.g., reach the end of the maze or collect all coins).
- **Reward System:** A defined reward structure that guides the agent's learning.
- **Training Loop:**  A function to train the agent iteratively.
- **Visualization:** Basic display of the game state and the agent's progress.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporate a more complex game environment with multiple obstacles or dynamic elements.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Development:** Design and implement the core game logic using Pygame. Create a simple game environment with clear rules and a scoring mechanism.
2. **Agent Implementation:**  Choose an RL algorithm (start with Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic. Define states, actions, and rewards within the game's context.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively allows the agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy.
4. **Visualization:**  Implement basic visualization to track the agent's performance and learning progress. This could involve displaying the game state and reward accumulated over time.
5. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent and evaluate its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward system that guides the agent towards the desired behavior can be challenging. Experimentation and iteration will be necessary.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal parameters for the RL algorithm (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) may require some experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application and understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning).
- Experience in building simple game engines and integrating AI agents into them.  Reinforces skills in game development and AI programming.
