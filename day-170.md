#  Miniature Robot Obstacle Avoidance with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a miniature robot capable of autonomously navigating a simple obstacle course using a lightweight machine learning model for real-time object detection and avoidance. The focus is on rapid prototyping and efficient implementation using readily available hardware and software.  The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of machine learning in robotics within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow Lite Micro (for the machine learning model), OpenCV (for image processing), a suitable robotics library (e.g., RPi.GPIO for Raspberry Pi).
* **Hardware:**  A small robot platform (e.g., a Raspberry Pi-based robot car), a small camera module (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2), and an obstacle course (simple objects like boxes or cups).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** The robot should detect obstacles (objects) in its path using a pre-trained or quickly-trained TensorFlow Lite Micro model.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Based on the detected objects, the robot should implement basic avoidance maneuvers (e.g., turning or stopping).
- **Motor Control:** The robot's motors should be controlled precisely to execute avoidance maneuvers.
- **Camera Feed Display (Optional):**  Display the camera feed and detected objects on a monitor for visualization.
- **Distance Measurement (Advanced):** Integrate a distance sensor (e.g., ultrasonic) to refine the avoidance strategy, prioritizing closer objects.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Selection/Training:** Choose a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite Micro model for object detection (e.g., MobileNetV1). If time allows, train a simple model on a small dataset of relevant objects.  Quantize the model for efficient execution on the microcontroller.
2. **Robot Integration:** Integrate the camera module and connect it to the robot's microcontroller. Implement the code to capture images from the camera.
3. **Object Detection and Avoidance Logic:** Integrate the TensorFlow Lite Micro model into the code. Implement logic to process the model's output, identify obstacles, and command the motors accordingly.
4. **Motor Control Implementation:** Program the robot's motors to react to the detection and avoidance logic.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the robot on the prepared obstacle course and iteratively refine the avoidance algorithm based on observations.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:**  The microcontroller's limited processing power might necessitate using a very lightweight machine learning model.
- **Accuracy and Robustness:** The accuracy of the object detection model and the robustness of the avoidance algorithm might need adjustments depending on lighting and the nature of obstacles.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Machine Learning:**  Practical experience in deploying and integrating machine learning models onto resource-constrained devices.
- **Real-time Robotics Control:**  Reinforce skills in programming and controlling robotic hardware in real-time.
