# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a quick calibration routine for a robotic arm using a computer vision system.  Accurate calibration is crucial for precise robotic movements, and this project aims to create a streamlined process that can be implemented and tested within a short timeframe.  The goal is to leverage readily available computer vision libraries to automate the calibration process, reducing the manual effort typically involved.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (specific to the arm being used â€“ e.g., ROS, manufacturer-specific SDK).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (preferably with a known kinematic model), a webcam or camera, a computer.

## Features & Requirements

- **Automatic Detection of Calibration Markers:** The system should automatically detect pre-defined markers (e.g., colored circles or Aruco markers) placed at known locations in the robotic arm's workspace.
- **Forward Kinematics Calculation:** The system should calculate the end-effector position based on the robot's joint angles using its forward kinematics model.
- **Calibration Parameter Estimation:** Using the detected marker positions and the calculated end-effector positions, the system should estimate calibration parameters (e.g., joint offsets, link lengths).
- **Error Minimization:**  The system should implement an optimization algorithm (e.g., least squares) to minimize the difference between the actual and calculated marker positions.
- **Visual Feedback:** The system should provide visual feedback (e.g., overlaying calculated positions on the camera image) to aid in debugging and verification.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a more sophisticated optimization algorithm (e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt).
- **Advanced Features:** Include support for different camera models and distortion correction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Marker Detection:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. Implement OpenCV code to detect the calibration markers in the camera feed.
2. **Forward Kinematics:**  Implement the forward kinematics model for the robotic arm. This will require knowledge of the arm's specifications.
3. **Calibration Parameter Estimation:** Develop the algorithm to estimate the calibration parameters using the detected marker positions and forward kinematics results.  Start with a simple least-squares approach.
4. **Error Minimization and Refinement:** Implement the optimization algorithm to refine the calibration parameters and minimize errors.
5. **Visual Feedback and Testing:** Integrate visual feedback to display the detected markers and calculated positions. Test the calibration by commanding the arm to move to specific points and verifying its accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Marker Detection:**  Robust marker detection in varied lighting conditions can be challenging. Consider using more sophisticated methods like Aruco markers or advanced image processing techniques.
- **Forward Kinematics Model Accuracy:**  Inaccuracies in the forward kinematics model will affect calibration accuracy. Double-check the model's parameters and consider using a more precise model if available.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:**  This project strengthens skills in image processing, feature detection, and camera calibration.
- **Develop proficiency in robotic arm control and calibration:**  This project enhances practical knowledge of robotic arm kinematics and calibration procedures.
