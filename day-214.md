# Self-Balancing Robot Simulation

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simplified simulation of a self-balancing robot (e.g., a Segway-like robot) using a physics engine.  The goal is to implement a basic control system to keep the robot upright, demonstrating fundamental concepts in robotics and control theory within a short timeframe. This simulation provides a safe and efficient environment for experimenting with different control algorithms without the need for physical hardware.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Physics Simulation:** Simulate the robot's dynamics, including gravity, inertia, and torque applied by the wheels.
- **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain balance.  The controller should adjust wheel speeds based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
- **Visualization:** Display the robot's state (angle, velocity) and its movement on a Pygame window.
- **User Input (Optional):** Allow for user input (e.g., keyboard) to apply external forces or torques to the simulated robot.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log the robot's angle, velocity, and control signals over time for analysis.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pygame, NumPy) and create a basic Pygame window.
2. **Implement the robot model:** Define the robot's physical parameters (mass, inertia, wheel radius) and implement equations of motion using NumPy.
3. **Implement the PID controller:** Define the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) and implement the control algorithm to calculate the required wheel speeds based on the robot's state.
4. **Integrate the physics and controller:** Combine the robot model and the PID controller in a simulation loop, updating the robot's state at each time step.
5. **Add visualization:** Display the robot's state and movement in the Pygame window.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Tuning the PID Controller:** Finding appropriate PID gains to achieve stable balance can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with simple values and adjust incrementally.
- **Numerical Stability:**  The simulation might exhibit instability due to numerical errors in the integration of equations of motion. Using a suitable time step and integration method is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of PID controllers:** This project provides hands-on experience implementing and tuning a PID controller, a crucial component in many control systems.
- **Gain familiarity with physics-based simulations:**  The project strengthens understanding of how to model and simulate physical systems using programming.
