# Minimax AI for a Simplified Board Game

## Overview

This project involves creating a Minimax AI agent to play a simplified version of a strategy board game (e.g., tic-tac-toe with a slightly larger board or a simplified version of Connect Four). The goal is to develop a functional AI that can play optimally against a human opponent within a short timeframe, showcasing the core concepts of the Minimax algorithm and game tree search.  The simplified game rules ensure the computational complexity remains manageable for a day's work.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `numpy` (for efficient array handling), potentially `pygame` (for basic GUI, optional).

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game board with simplified rules.
    -  An AI player using the Minimax algorithm with depth-limited search.
    -  A human player interface (command-line or simple GUI).
    -  Clear win/loss/draw determination.
    -  Game state visualization (optional, but recommended for debugging).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Alpha-Beta pruning for improved Minimax efficiency.
    - Difficulty levels controlled by search depth.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board & Rules:** Define the game's rules and create a data structure (e.g., NumPy array) to represent the game board.
2. **Minimax Implementation:** Implement the Minimax algorithm recursively, evaluating game states and selecting the optimal move.  Start with a limited search depth for initial testing.
3. **Human Player Interaction:** Create a simple interface (command-line or basic GUI with `pygame`) allowing human input for moves.
4. **Game Loop:** Integrate the AI and human player interactions into a game loop, managing turns and checking for win/loss conditions.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the AI against itself and a human player, adjusting the search depth or adding alpha-beta pruning as needed to balance performance and accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:**  Even with a simplified game, a deep search tree can become computationally expensive.  Managing search depth is crucial to avoid excessive runtime.
- **Heuristic Function (Optional):** For more complex games, a heuristic function might be needed to evaluate non-terminal game states, guiding the Minimax algorithm more efficiently.  For this simplified project, a simple win/loss check suffices.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of the Minimax algorithm and its application in game AI.
- Practical experience with algorithm implementation, debugging, and performance optimization in a time-constrained environment.
