# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection with intelligent traffic light control. The simulation will utilize a basic algorithm to optimize traffic flow based on simulated vehicle arrival rates at each approach.  This allows for experimentation with different control strategies and provides a visual representation of their impact.  The significance lies in its potential for quickly prototyping and evaluating different traffic management algorithms without the need for real-world infrastructure.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computations), Matplotlib (optional, for data analysis)

## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Simulate vehicles arriving at each approach of the intersection with adjustable arrival rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light control algorithm (e.g., fixed-time, simple cycle-based) that switches the lights based on simulated vehicle queues.
- **Visualization:** Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light states using Pygame.
- **Queue Management:** Track the number of vehicles waiting at each approach.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Collect data on average waiting times and throughput.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated traffic light control algorithm (e.g., actuated control) that dynamically adjusts the cycle length based on detected vehicle queues.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporate vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks) with different speeds and lengths.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Initialization:** Set up the Pygame window, define the intersection geometry, and initialize vehicle queues and traffic light states.
2. **Vehicle Generation and Movement:** Implement vehicle generation at each approach with adjustable arrival rates.  Simulate vehicle movement across the intersection.
3. **Traffic Light Control Implementation:**  Implement the chosen traffic light control algorithm (start with a simple fixed-time strategy).
4. **Visualization Update:** Continuously update the Pygame display to show the current state of the simulation (vehicle positions, traffic light status).
5. **Data Collection and Analysis:** Collect data on waiting times and throughput, potentially using Matplotlib for visualization of results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:** Balancing the complexity of the traffic control algorithm with the time constraint of a daily challenge. A simpler algorithm can be implemented first, and more complex algorithms can be added iteratively.
- **Visualization Performance:**  Ensuring that the Pygame visualization runs smoothly even with a large number of simulated vehicles might require optimization techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforces:**  Practical application of algorithm design and implementation.
- **Reinforces:** Experience with event-driven programming and game development principles through Pygame.
