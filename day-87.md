# Mini-Project:  Real-time Object Tracking & Classification with Webcam

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam.  It focuses on leveraging readily available libraries to achieve a functional prototype quickly, showcasing efficient integration of computer vision techniques. The significance lies in its applicability to various domains, including robotics (basic navigation), security (intrusion detection), and interactive gaming.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (for pre-trained model), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with Python and necessary libraries installed.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Webcam Feed:**  Capture and display a live video stream from the webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the video stream.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:**  Draw a bounding box around the detected object on the video feed.
- **Basic Classification (Optional):**  Classify the detected object into a few predefined categories (e.g., red ball, blue cube).

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple object following mechanism (e.g., move a virtual cursor on the screen).
- **Advanced Feature:** Use a more sophisticated object detection model (YOLOv5, SSD) instead of simpler methods.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy`). Test webcam functionality with OpenCV.
2. **Object Detection:**  Implement a simple color-based object detection (for example, detecting a red ball based on its HSV color range). Alternatively, load a pre-trained object detection model from TensorFlow/Keras for more robust detection.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`) to track the detected object across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes around the detected and tracked object.  Display the results in the webcam feed.
5. **(Optional) Classification and Following:** If using a pre-trained model, utilize its classification capabilities. Implement a basic control mechanism (e.g., moving a mouse cursor) based on the object's position.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially with complex models.  Consider simplifying the model or reducing resolution for faster processing.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracker might lose the object if it gets temporarily occluded. Exploring more robust tracking algorithms would be needed for handling such scenarios.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision Concepts:** Practical application of object detection, tracking, and classification techniques.
- **Experience with OpenCV and Deep Learning Libraries:**  Hands-on experience integrating and utilizing OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras for a real-world application.
