# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implement a basic AI opponent using a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning). The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating fundamental RL concepts within a constrained timeframe. The game could be a simple 2D environment like a maze navigation or a simplified version of Pong.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), NumPy (for numerical computation), and a reinforcement learning library like `gym` or a custom implementation of Q-learning.

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Engine:** A functional 2D game environment (e.g., maze or simplified Pong).
- **Player Control:**  Basic player controls (keyboard or mouse).
- **AI Opponent:** An AI agent that learns to play the game using Q-learning.
- **Reward System:** A clear reward mechanism to guide the AI's learning process.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track the AI's progress (e.g., score, steps to completion).

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a simple visualization of the Q-table or learning process.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Explore different hyperparameters of the Q-learning algorithm to observe their impact on performance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create the core game logic and user interface using Pygame. Focus on a minimal, functional version.
2. **Environment Design:** Define the game state, actions, and reward structure for the RL agent.
3. **Q-learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm, focusing on a simple version suitable for the chosen game.
4. **Training Loop:** Train the AI agent for a set number of episodes or until a satisfactory performance level is reached.
5. **Testing and Evaluation:** Evaluate the AI's performance against a baseline (e.g., random actions) and fine-tune parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Shaping:** Designing a reward function that effectively guides the AI towards desired behavior can be challenging and requires careful consideration. Experimentation might be needed.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance:** Finding the right balance between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions) in the Q-learning algorithm will significantly impact performance.  This can be addressed through parameter tuning of the epsilon-greedy strategy.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with implementing a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning).
- **Game AI Development:** Learn how to integrate an AI agent into a simple game environment.
