# Smart Home Device Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system that controls a smart home device (e.g., a smart lamp) using both voice commands and hand gestures. This combines two popular interaction modalities, allowing for a more intuitive and flexible control experience.  The focus will be on a quick proof-of-concept rather than a fully-fledged, polished application.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  PyAudio (audio input), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), OpenCV (computer vision), mediapipe (gesture recognition), RPi.GPIO (for GPIO control, if using a Raspberry Pi)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi, Smart Lamp (or other controllable device), Webcam

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the lamp," "Dim the lamp."
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should interpret simple hand gestures (e.g., wave for on/off, thumbs up/down for brightness control).
- **Device Integration:** The system should control at least one smart home device.  This could be simulated or connected to a real device via its API.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle situations like unrecognized voice commands or inaccurate gesture recognition.
- **Basic UI (Optional):** A simple visual interface displaying the current status of the device.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Multiple device control, customizable voice commands and gestures, integration with a cloud platform.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary libraries, configure hardware (if using).
2. **Voice recognition implementation:** Integrate SpeechRecognition to process audio input and convert it to text. Implement basic command parsing.
3. **Gesture recognition:** Use OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and classify hand gestures from webcam input. Map gestures to control actions.
4. **Device control integration:**  Write code to interface with the chosen smart home device (API calls or direct GPIO control).
5. **Combine modules:** Integrate voice and gesture recognition modules, ensuring smooth operation and efficient error handling.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech and Gesture Recognition:**  Real-world environments introduce noise and variations that can affect accuracy. Robust error handling and potentially alternative algorithms are necessary.
- **Hardware limitations:** If using a Raspberry Pi, resource management and processing speed can be limiting factors. Optimizing code and simplifying the system might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal interaction design:**  Understanding the challenges and benefits of combining different input modalities.
- **Real-time processing of sensor data:**  Experience with efficient processing of audio and video streams for immediate control.
