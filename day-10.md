# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four) using reinforcement learning. The goal is to create a functional AI opponent that can be trained and improved within a day or two.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and iterative improvement, showcasing the power of reinforcement learning in a concise application.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (for rapid prototyping)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -  An AI agent using a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
    -  Training loop to iteratively improve the AI's performance.
    -  Basic performance evaluation metrics (win rate, loss rate, draw rate).
    -  User interface to play against the AI.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the AI's learning rate and exploration/exploitation balance.
    -  Visualization of the Q-table or policy (depending on the algorithm used).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple game environment using Python and a suitable library (Gym recommended).  Focus on a clear and concise implementation.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent or a simpler reinforcement learning algorithm tailored to the game.
3. **Training Loop:** Design and implement a training loop to train the AI agent against itself or a random player. Monitor performance metrics.
4. **User Interface:** Create a basic text-based or simple graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the trained AI.
5. **Evaluation and Refinement:** Evaluate the performance of the AI. Iterate on the algorithm or hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the AI to optimal play can be challenging.  Careful consideration of rewards for wins, losses, and draws is crucial.
- **Computational Resources:** Depending on the complexity of the game and the reinforcement learning algorithm, training might require significant computational resources.  Consider simplifying the algorithm or reducing the training iterations if necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement learning concepts:  Practical application of Q-learning or a similar algorithm.
- Agent-environment interaction: Understanding the fundamental principles of how an AI agent interacts with its environment and learns from it.
