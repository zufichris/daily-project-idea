# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI

## Overview

This project aims to develop a lightweight prototype of an AI-powered tool that automatically enforces a specific coding style guide within a given codebase.  This addresses the common software engineering challenge of maintaining consistent code style across a project, improving readability and collaboration.  The focus will be on a single programming language for brevity.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Trees),  `clang-format` (or similar formatter for chosen language, if not Python), scikit-learn (or another suitable ML library for optional advanced feature).
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code recommended), Git for version control.

## Features & Requirements

- **Code Parsing:**  The tool should parse a given code file (e.g., Python `.py` file) using the `ast` module to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Style Rule Enforcement:**  It should check the AST against a predefined set of style rules (e.g., maximum line length, indentation style, spacing around operators).
- **Violation Reporting:** The tool should generate a report listing all style violations found, including line numbers and descriptions.
- **Automated Formatting (optional):**  Integrate with `clang-format` (or equivalent) to automatically correct simple style violations.
- **Feedback Generation (Advanced):**  Use Machine Learning to learn common style violation patterns and provide improved suggestions to the developer beyond basic checks.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Rule Definition:** Define a set of 3-5 key style rules (e.g., maximum line length of 80 characters, 4-space indentation) as a Python data structure.
2. **AST Parsing and Rule Checking:** Implement functions to parse the code using `ast` and compare the AST nodes against the defined style rules.
3. **Report Generation:** Create a function to generate a clear report listing the file, line number, and description for each violation.
4. **Formatter Integration (Optional):** Integrate with `clang-format` to automatically correct identified violations where possible.
5. **Basic UI (Optional):**  Create a simple command-line interface or a basic GUI to improve user interaction.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Complex Code Structures:**  Parsing and analyzing complex code structures (e.g., nested functions, classes) accurately can be challenging.  Focus on simpler constructs initially.
- **Rule Completeness:** Defining a comprehensive set of style rules that covers all relevant aspects of the chosen style guide is a non-trivial task. Prioritize a small, well-defined subset.

## Learning Outcomes

- **AST Manipulation:** Gain practical experience with Abstract Syntax Trees and their application in static code analysis.
- **Code Style Enforcement:** Develop a deeper understanding of the importance of code style and its impact on code maintainability and collaboration.
