# TinyML-Powered Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a gesture-controlled smart home device using a microcontroller with machine learning capabilities (TinyML). The system will recognize a limited set of hand gestures via a small sensor (e.g., an accelerometer or a low-resolution camera) and trigger pre-defined smart home actions.  This project demonstrates the feasibility of deploying complex algorithms on resource-constrained hardware, a key aspect of IoT development.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with onboard sensor capabilities).
- **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE with TensorFlow Lite Micro libraries.
- **Sensor:**  Onboard accelerometer or optional low-resolution camera module (if available).
- **Machine Learning Model:** Pre-trained or quickly trainable model using a small dataset (e.g., hand gesture classification).
- **Smart Home Integration (Optional):**  Simple HTTP requests to control smart plugs, lights, etc.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., wave, fist, open palm).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process sensor data and classify gestures with minimal latency.
- **Action Triggering:** Map recognized gestures to specific smart home actions (e.g., wave to turn on lights, fist to increase volume).
- **User Calibration:** Allow for initial calibration to adapt to individual user's gesture patterns.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Store sensor data and classification results for analysis and model improvement.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install the Arduino IDE, TensorFlow Lite Micro libraries, and necessary drivers for the chosen microcontroller and sensor.
2. **Data Acquisition (if training a new model):** Collect a small dataset of sensor readings for each gesture. This could involve manually labeling data or using a pre-existing dataset.  If using a pre-trained model, skip this step.
3. **Model Training (if needed):** Train a lightweight machine learning model using TensorFlow Lite Micro's tools and the collected dataset. Alternatively, download a pre-trained model for hand gesture recognition.
4. **Integrate with Microcontroller:**  Implement the trained model on the microcontroller, processing sensor data in real-time and classifying gestures.
5. **Smart Home Action Implementation:** Trigger pre-defined actions based on the gesture classification results (e.g., send HTTP requests to control smart home devices).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of gesture recognition:**  Limited sensor resolution and noise can affect the accuracy of the system. Careful data preprocessing and model selection are crucial.
- **Real-time constraints:**  The processing power of the microcontroller is limited.  Efficient model design and optimization are essential for achieving real-time performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML implementation:** Gain practical experience in deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices.
- **Sensor data processing and feature engineering:**  Learn how to preprocess sensor data to improve the accuracy of machine learning models.
