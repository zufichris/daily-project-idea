# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet functional real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view and track its movement, displaying the object's location and trajectory on the screen. This project is significant because it demonstrates fundamental computer vision and robotics concepts in a compact and accessible way.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB Camera, Monitor (optional)
- **Other Tools:**  A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a simplified YOLO model or MobileNet SSD)


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display a bounding box around the detected object and potentially its trajectory on the camera feed.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Record the object's coordinates over time.
- **Alert System (Optional):** Trigger an alert (e.g., sound or LED) when the object leaves a predefined area.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) on the Raspberry Pi. Configure the camera and test the camera feed.  Download a pre-trained object detection model suitable for the Pi's processing power.
2. **Object Detection:** Load the pre-trained model and integrate it into the OpenCV pipeline. Write code to process each frame from the camera, detect the target object, and draw a bounding box around it.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `calcOpticalFlowPyrLK` function or a centroid-based approach) to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Display the camera feed with the bounding box and potentially trajectory visualization using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Optional Features:** Implement data logging or an alert system based on the object's position.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi has limited processing power. Selecting an appropriately lightweight object detection model is crucial for real-time performance.  Consider using a simplified model or reducing image resolution if necessary.
- **Accuracy of Tracking:**  Simple tracking algorithms can struggle with occlusion or rapid object movement. Experiment with different tracking methods to find the most robust solution for the specific object and environment.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of real-time image processing:**  This project provides hands-on experience with acquiring, processing, and displaying video streams in real-time.
- **Develop proficiency in object detection and tracking algorithms:**  Participants will gain practical experience with implementing and evaluating different object detection and tracking techniques.
