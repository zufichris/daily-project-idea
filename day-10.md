#  Miniature Robot Maze Solver with Adaptive Pathfinding

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a miniature robot (simulated or physical) capable of autonomously navigating a randomly generated maze using an adaptive pathfinding algorithm. The significance lies in demonstrating real-time adaptation to environmental changes and showcasing efficient path planning techniques within a constrained timeframe.  This is ideal for practicing robotics and algorithmic concepts in a tangible way.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Robotics Simulator (Optional):** V-REP, Gazebo, PyBullet (for physical robot, suitable hardware/software stack would be needed)
* **Libraries:**  NumPy (for numerical computation), OpenCV (for image processing if using camera input), a pathfinding library like `pathfinding` or a custom implementation of A* or Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features & Requirements

- **Maze Generation:**  Generate a random maze using a suitable algorithm (e.g., recursive backtracker).
- **Robot Simulation/Control:**  Simulate a robot's movement within the maze environment or control a physical robot.
- **Pathfinding:** Implement an A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot should detect and avoid obstacles within the maze.  This could be simulated or through sensor data (e.g., ultrasonic sensors).
- **Goal Detection:**  The robot should be able to detect when it reaches the goal.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement an adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts the path based on newly discovered obstacles or changes in the environment.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate a simple machine learning model to improve pathfinding efficiency over multiple maze runs.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Maze Generation & Visualization:** Implement a maze generation algorithm and visualize the maze using a suitable library (e.g., Matplotlib or a game engine if simulating).
2. **Robot Simulation/Initialization:** Set up the robot's initial position and orientation within the maze.  This could involve defining a simple robot model or using an existing one in a simulator.
3. **Pathfinding Implementation:** Implement the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path.
4. **Obstacle Avoidance & Movement:**  Integrate obstacle avoidance logic.  This might involve checking for collisions based on the robot's position and the maze structure or processing sensor data from a simulated or physical sensor.  Then implement the movement logic to follow the path.
5. **Goal Detection & Termination:** Implement the condition to detect reaching the goal and end the simulation/robot's movement.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Efficiency:**  Ensuring the pathfinding algorithm is efficient enough to find a solution within a reasonable time for complex mazes.  This might require optimizing the algorithm or using heuristics.
- **Sensor Integration (Physical Robot):**  If using a physical robot, integrating and calibrating sensors reliably will be a significant challenge.  Time constraints may limit the complexity of sensor integration.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of pathfinding algorithms:**  This project provides practical experience in implementing and optimizing A* search, a fundamental algorithm in robotics and AI.
- **Experience in robot simulation or control:**  Depending on the chosen approach, the project offers valuable experience in using robotics simulators or interacting with physical robots.
