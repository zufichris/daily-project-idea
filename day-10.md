# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple calibration procedure for a robotic arm using a computer vision system.  The goal is to accurately determine the robot's end-effector position in Cartesian coordinates by analyzing images captured by a camera. This is crucial for precise robotic manipulation tasks, and this mini-project will focus on a simplified but functional approach achievable within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
* **Robotics Framework:**  A simple robotic arm control library (e.g., a library specific to your robot, or a simulated environment like PyBullet)
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, low-DOF one), a camera (webcam sufficient), and a calibration target (a checkerboard pattern printed on paper).


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture images from the camera and detect the checkerboard pattern using OpenCV.
- **Coordinate Transformation:**  Calculate the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (using OpenCV's calibration functions).
- **Robot Arm Control:**  Send commands to the robotic arm to move to specific pre-defined positions.
- **Position Mapping:**  Relate the pixel coordinates of the checkerboard in the image to the robot arm's joint angles and end-effector position in the Cartesian coordinate system.
- **Calibration Accuracy Verification:**  Test the accuracy of the calibration by commanding the robot arm to reach several points and verifying the actual end-effector position.


- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a real-time feedback loop to refine the calibration based on observed discrepancies.
- **Optional Feature:** Use a more sophisticated calibration target or algorithm to improve accuracy (e.g., a 3D calibration target).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Image Acquisition:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. Capture a series of images of the checkerboard at different robot arm configurations.
2. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV functions to calibrate the camera, determining its intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients).
3. **Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV to estimate the pose (position and orientation) of the checkerboard in each image relative to the camera.
4. **Coordinate Transformation:**  Establish the relationship between the camera coordinate system, the robot's coordinate system, and the checkerboard coordinates.  This will involve potentially using transformation matrices and potentially a known transformation between camera and robot base.
5. **Calibration Verification:** Move the robot arm to several pre-defined points and compare the actual and expected end-effector positions based on the calibration.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Camera Calibration:** Achieving high accuracy depends on proper image capture and the quality of the calibration target.  Dealing with lens distortion will be crucial.
- **Robot Arm Model Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the calibration is also limited by the accuracy of the robot arm's kinematic model. A simple model may be sufficient for this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- This project will reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques, particularly camera calibration and pose estimation using OpenCV.
- It will provide practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic control, enhancing skills in robotics and automation.
