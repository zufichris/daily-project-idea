# Automated Bug Report Generator for Unit Tests

## Overview

This project aims to develop a tool that automatically generates concise and informative bug reports from failed unit tests.  Instead of simply stating a test failed, the tool will analyze the failure, extract relevant code snippets, and produce a report ready for immediate issue tracking in a system like Jira or GitHub Issues. This streamlines the debugging process and saves significant time during software development.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with pytest framework for unit testing examples)
* **Testing Framework:** pytest (or equivalent for your chosen language)
* **Libraries:**  `traceback`,  `inspect` (Python), potentially `requests` for API integration with issue trackers.
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text etc.),  a terminal or command prompt, potentially a local issue tracker or online service like GitHub.


## Features & Requirements

- **Automated Report Generation:**  Upon test failure, automatically generate a report containing:
    - The name of the failed test.
    - The type of error (e.g., AssertionError, TypeError).
    - A concise error message.
    - A relevant code snippet highlighting the line of failure.
- **Customizable Report Format:**  Ability to generate reports in different formats (e.g., plain text, JSON, Markdown).
- **Integration with Issue Trackers (Optional):**  Ability to automatically create issues in a chosen issue tracking system (Jira, GitHub Issues, etc.) using API calls.
- **Test Case Filtering:** Ability to select specific test cases or modules for reporting.
- **Report Aggregation:** Consolidation of multiple failed test reports into a single, unified document.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Core Functionality:** Develop the basic structure that captures test failure information (test name, error type, message) using the `traceback` and `inspect` modules in Python.  Write a simple function to format this information into a plain text report.
2. **Code Snippet Extraction:** Implement logic to extract a relevant code snippet from the stack trace, focusing on the line where the error occurred.
3. **Report Formatting:** Enhance the report to include the extracted code snippet and allow for customization of the output format (e.g., using f-strings for formatted text or JSON encoding).
4. **(Optional) Issue Tracker Integration:** If time permits, create a basic implementation to push the generated report to an issue tracker's API using the `requests` library.  Start with a simple POST request.
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the tool with various types of test failures in different scenarios.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Complex Stack Traces:**  Extracting relevant code snippets from complex stack traces (especially those involving multiple function calls) might require careful parsing and handling.  Consider using regular expressions or dedicated parsing libraries for complex scenarios.
- **API Integration Complexity:** If attempting integration with an issue tracker's API, be mindful of authentication, rate limiting, and API-specific requirements.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Error Handling and Debugging:** This project reinforces best practices in handling exceptions and debugging failed tests effectively.
- **Automated Testing and CI/CD:**  It provides hands-on experience with automated test reporting, a crucial aspect of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines.
