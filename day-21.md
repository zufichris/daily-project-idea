# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to develop a Python script that uses a camera to locate a known target object and adjust the robotic arm's end-effector position to accurately grasp it. This is a crucial step in robotic automation and can be a significant time saver compared to manual calibration.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, a robotic arm control library (e.g., PySerial for serial communication with Arduino-based controllers, or a manufacturer-specific library).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, low-cost one will suffice), a webcam or camera, a known target object (e.g., a colored block).


## Features & Requirements

- **Target Detection:** The script should accurately detect the target object in the camera feed using color filtering or other computer vision techniques.
- **Arm Position Calculation:** Based on the target's location in the image, the script should calculate the necessary joint angles for the robotic arm to reach the target.  This will involve some basic inverse kinematics.  Simplification assumptions are acceptable for a daily challenge (e.g., 2D planar movement).
- **Arm Control:** The script should send commands to the robotic arm to move to the calculated position.
- **Error Correction:** Implement a basic error correction mechanism (e.g., iterative refinement) to account for inaccuracies in the camera calibration or arm kinematics.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the camera feed and calculated arm position overlays on the screen.

**Advanced Features:**
- Real-time feedback adjustment.
- 3D target localization and grasping.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Target Detection Setup:** Implement color filtering or another suitable method to detect the target object in the camera feed using OpenCV.
2. **Calibration and Mapping:** Establish a relationship between pixel coordinates in the camera image and the real-world coordinates of the robotic arm's workspace.  This might involve simple assumptions or a basic camera calibration if time permits.
3. **Inverse Kinematics (Simplified):** Develop a simplified inverse kinematic model to calculate the joint angles based on the target's position. For a daily challenge, focus on a 2D or very simplified 3D model.
4. **Arm Control Integration:** Send commands to move the robotic arm to the target position using the appropriate control library.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system and iterate on the detection and control algorithms to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Inverse Kinematics:** Simple inverse kinematics might be inaccurate, especially for more complex arm designs.  Focus on a simplified model for the daily challenge scope.
- **Camera Calibration:**  Precise camera calibration is time-consuming. For a daily project, assumptions about camera parameters or a simplified approach are acceptable.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of computer vision techniques for robotic control.
- Understanding and implementation of (simplified) inverse kinematics.
- Experience with integrating different software and hardware components for a robotic system.
