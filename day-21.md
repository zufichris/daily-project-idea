# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robotic Object Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a miniature AI-powered image caption generator specifically designed to improve object recognition capabilities in a small-scale robotic system.  The goal is to build a system that takes an image as input from a robotic camera and generates a concise, descriptive caption, enhancing the robot's understanding of its environment. This is particularly useful for tasks like object sorting, bin picking, or navigation in cluttered spaces.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Flask (optional for API)
- **Pre-trained Model:**  A pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or similar).
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A Raspberry Pi with a camera module (for a physical robotic application).


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Input:** Accept an image file or stream from a camera.
- **Caption Generation:** Generate a descriptive caption for the image using the pre-trained model.
- **Output Display:** Display the generated caption alongside the input image.
- **Accuracy Metric (Optional):** Implement a simple metric (e.g., BLEU score) to evaluate caption quality against a small ground truth dataset.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where the model fails to generate a caption or encounters an invalid input.

- **Advanced Features:**  Integration with a simple robotic control system to trigger actions based on recognized objects.
- **Optional Feature:** Creation of a simple REST API using Flask for remote access and control.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV, Flask â€“ if using). Download a pre-trained image captioning model.
2. **Image Preprocessing:** Use OpenCV to load and preprocess the input image (resizing, normalization).
3. **Caption Generation:** Feed the preprocessed image to the pre-trained model and retrieve the generated caption.
4. **Output and Display:** Display the input image and generated caption side-by-side (using a GUI library or printing to the console).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test with various images and refine parameters (if necessary) to improve caption accuracy.  (If using the optional API, develop and test the API endpoints).


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models might not be perfectly accurate for all object types or contexts. Addressing this might involve fine-tuning the model on a specific dataset relevant to the robot's application.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Achieving real-time caption generation might require optimization and potentially using a more lightweight model.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of deep learning models for image captioning.
- Practical experience with image processing libraries (OpenCV) and integration with pre-trained models.  (API development experience if the optional feature is included).
