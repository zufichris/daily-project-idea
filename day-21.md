# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified calibration system for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately determine the robot's end-effector position in 3D space using a single camera and a known calibration target.  This is a crucial step in many robotic applications, enabling precise manipulation and interaction with the environment. The daily challenge lies in achieving sufficient accuracy within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotics library like PyRobot or a specific arm's SDK.
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simulated one is acceptable), a webcam or camera, and a calibration target (e.g., a chessboard).

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:**  Determine intrinsic camera parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) using OpenCV's calibration functions.
- **Target Detection:**  Detect and locate the calibration target in the camera image using OpenCV's feature detection and matching algorithms.
- **3D Position Estimation:** Calculate the 3D position and orientation of the target relative to the camera using the camera calibration results and target geometry.
- **Robotic Arm Control (Optional):**  Move the robotic arm to a specified point based on the calculated 3D target position. This assumes integration with a robotic arm's control system.
- **Accuracy Evaluation:** Compare the actual and estimated position (if the arm is physical and its actual position is known).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function with images of the calibration target from various viewpoints.
2. **Target Detection:**  Implement a robust target detection algorithm (e.g., using ORB or SIFT features).  This should provide the 2D coordinates of the target in the image.
3. **3D Point Calculation:** Use the camera parameters and target geometry to compute the 3D position and orientation of the target using projective geometry principles (e.g., Perspective-n-Point algorithm).
4. **Robotic Arm Control (Optional):** If using a physical robot, integrate the calculated 3D coordinates with the robot's control system to move the end-effector to the target location.
5. **Accuracy Evaluation (Optional):** Compare the estimated 3D coordinates with ground truth measurements (e.g., using the robot arm's built-in sensors) to evaluate the calibration accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Target Detection:**  Handling variations in lighting, occlusions, and image noise can be challenging.  Consider using robust feature detectors and outlier rejection techniques.
- **Accuracy Limitations:**  Achieving high accuracy in a short time might require simplifying assumptions or using pre-calibrated components.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of Computer Vision techniques:**  Reinforces the understanding of camera calibration, feature detection, and 3D reconstruction.
- **Integration of Computer Vision and Robotics:**  Provides experience in combining vision-based sensing with robotic control.
