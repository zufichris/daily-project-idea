# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, game AI using reinforcement learning techniques.  The game will be a minimalist 2D environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing of the AI's learning capabilities.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental application of reinforcement learning in a controlled environment, showcasing core concepts within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development and visualization)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items).
    - An AI agent controlled by a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
    - Basic reward system to guide the AI's learning.
    - Real-time visualization of the agent's actions and learning progress.
    - Ability to save and load the trained AI model.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Adding more complex game mechanics or a larger environment.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the basic game environment using Pygame. This involves creating the game window, objects, and basic game logic.
2. **AI Agent Implementation:**  Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (start with Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic to interact with the environment. Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop to run the agent in the environment, allowing it to learn through trial and error.  Visualize the agent's progress (e.g., plot the reward over time).
4. **Testing and Evaluation:** Test the trained AI agent in the game environment and evaluate its performance based on its ability to achieve the game's objective.
5. **Model Saving and Loading (Optional):** Implement functionality to save and load the trained AI model for later use.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the reinforcement learning algorithm can be challenging and requires experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and adjust based on observation.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or unexpected behavior from the AI agent.  Careful consideration is needed to ensure the reward function effectively guides the AI towards the desired behavior.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcing understanding of reinforcement learning principles and algorithms (e.g., Q-learning).
- Practical experience in implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.  This includes handling state and action spaces, designing reward functions, and training loops.
