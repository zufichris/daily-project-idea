# Automated Bug Triage System Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype of an automated bug triage system using machine learning.  The system will analyze bug reports (text descriptions) and automatically categorize them based on severity and area of impact (e.g., frontend, backend, database). This can significantly reduce the time spent manually triaging bugs, allowing developers to focus on fixing issues more efficiently.  The prototype will focus on a small, well-defined domain for faster development.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Library:** scikit-learn
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Library:** spaCy or NLTK
- **Data Storage:** SQLite or in-memory data structures for the prototype
- **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm

## Features & Requirements

- **Bug Report Ingestion:**  Ability to input bug reports as plain text.
- **Severity Classification:** Classify bug reports into severity levels (e.g., critical, major, minor).
- **Area of Impact Classification:** Categorize bug reports based on the affected system component (e.g., frontend, backend, database).
- **Output Generation:** Display classified bug reports with their assigned severity and area.
- **Accuracy Metrics:**  Calculate basic accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) on a test dataset.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a bug tracking system (e.g., Jira),  handling multiple languages for bug reports.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation:** Gather a small dataset of bug reports (at least 50-100) with pre-assigned severity and area labels.  Clean and preprocess the text data (removing punctuation, lowercasing, etc.).
2. **Model Training:**  Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) using the prepared dataset.  Experiment with different NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings) for text feature extraction.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
4. **Prototype Development:** Create a simple user interface (command-line or basic GUI) to input bug reports and display the classification results.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the prototype with new bug reports and iterate on the model and UI based on the results.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Scarcity:**  A small dataset might limit the model's accuracy. Addressing this could involve data augmentation techniques or using transfer learning with pre-trained NLP models.
- **Ambiguous Bug Reports:** Some bug reports might be ambiguous, making accurate classification challenging.  Strategies like incorporating contextual information or using more sophisticated NLP models can help mitigate this.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of machine learning:** Building a functional machine learning model from data preparation to evaluation and deployment in a real-world context.
- **Experience with NLP techniques:** Implementing and comparing different NLP techniques for text feature extraction and classification.
