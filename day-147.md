# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Webcam

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet effective real-time object tracking and classification system using a standard webcam.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball, a person) within the webcam's field of view, displaying its location and classification on the video stream. This is a valuable skill applicable to numerous fields like robotics, security, and augmented reality.  The daily challenge lies in balancing speed of implementation with the accuracy and robustness of the tracking.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:**  Capture and display video from the webcam.
- **Object Detection:**  Detect the presence of the pre-defined object in each frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the object's movement across frames.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object.
- **Classification Confidence:** Display the confidence level of the object classification.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Object counting (if multiple instances of the object appear),  switching between different object classes during runtime.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, connect the webcam, and (if needed) acquire/prepare a small dataset for object classification (e.g., 50-100 images of the target object).  If using a pre-trained model, skip dataset creation.
2. **Object Detection/Classification Model:** Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5 Lite) or fine-tune a model on the acquired dataset.  Prioritize speed over extreme accuracy.
3. **Real-time Video Processing:** Integrate the model with OpenCV to process frames from the webcam and apply object detection.
4. **Object Tracking Implementation:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.track` functions or a centroid tracker) to follow the detected object across frames.
5. **Visualization & Output:** Display the video stream with bounding boxes, classification labels, and confidence scores.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Balancing real-time processing with accuracy might necessitate using lightweight models and optimizing code for speed. Efficient data structures are vital.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracking algorithm may struggle if the object is temporarily occluded; consider incorporating techniques to handle brief interruptions.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience in integrating computer vision libraries (OpenCV) with deep learning models (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
- Understanding of real-time video processing constraints and optimization strategies.
