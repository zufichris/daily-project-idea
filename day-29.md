# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The focus will be on creating a functional, albeit basic, RL agent within a short timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts. This provides a practical application of RL principles that can be easily extended and improved upon.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, if not creating a custom one), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL model building)

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A functional implementation of the chosen game (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
- **RL Agent:** An agent trained using a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the agent iteratively, observing its performance and updating its strategy.
- **Evaluation:** A simple evaluation metric to assess the agent's performance (e.g., win rate against a random opponent).
- **Visualization (Optional):** Basic visualization of the game state and the agent's learning process.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Compare the performance of different RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning vs SARSA).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**  Create a functional game environment using Python. This could involve a class representing the game board and rules.  Consider using OpenAI Gym for simplified environment creation.
2. **Agent Design:** Design and implement the RL agent using a chosen algorithm (e.g., Q-learning). Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
3. **Training:** Implement a training loop to train the agent iteratively, allowing the agent to play against itself or a simple opponent (e.g., random strategy).
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the agent's performance by measuring its win rate against a random player or a pre-defined strategy.
5. **Refinement (Time Permitting):**  Tune hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor), implement advanced features, or try a different RL algorithm.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal play can be challenging. Experimentation and iteration are key.
- **Computational Cost:** Training RL agents can be computationally expensive.  Simplify the game or reduce the training iterations to fit the time constraint.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Understand and apply core concepts of RL, such as state, action, reward, and different RL algorithms.
- **Agent Design & Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating RL agents in a simple yet meaningful context.
