# Minimalist Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simplified inverse kinematics solver for a 2-degree-of-freedom robotic arm.  The goal is to develop a program that, given a desired end-effector position (x, y coordinates), calculates the corresponding joint angles required to reach that position. This is a fundamental problem in robotics, and a simplified version is achievable within a short timeframe.  This project prioritizes a clean, efficient implementation over complex robotic arm models.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - Input: Takes the desired (x, y) coordinates of the end-effector as input.
    - Calculation: Computes the necessary joint angles (θ1, θ2) using geometric inverse kinematics for a 2-DOF robotic arm with known link lengths.
    - Output: Displays the calculated joint angles (θ1, θ2).
    - Error Handling: Gracefully handles cases where the desired position is unreachable (e.g., outside the workspace).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Visualization: Plot the robotic arm's configuration using Matplotlib to visually verify the solution.
    - Workspace Visualization:  Plot the reachable workspace of the robotic arm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Robotic Arm:** Define the lengths of the two links (l1, l2) as constants.
2. **Implement the Inverse Kinematics Algorithm:**  Use the law of cosines and other trigonometric functions to derive and implement the equations for calculating θ1 and θ2 from the given (x, y) coordinates. Handle edge cases (singularities) appropriately.
3. **Create Input/Output Functionality:**  Develop a simple user interface (e.g., command-line input) to get the desired (x, y) coordinates and display the calculated angles.
4. **(Optional) Implement Visualization:**  Use Matplotlib to create a simple plot showing the robotic arm configuration for the calculated angles.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the solver with various input positions, verifying its accuracy and robustness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Singularities:**  The inverse kinematics solution might have singularities (multiple solutions or no solution) at certain configurations.  Implement appropriate error handling or choose a solution strategy (e.g., prioritizing a specific solution).
- **Accuracy & Precision:**  Floating-point precision might lead to minor inaccuracies in the calculated angles.  Consider using higher-precision data types if needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of inverse kinematics:** This project provides hands-on experience with a fundamental concept in robotics.
- **Improve problem-solving skills using trigonometry and geometry:** The solution requires applying mathematical principles to a practical engineering problem.
