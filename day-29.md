# Self-Balancing Robot Controller using PID

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified self-balancing robot controller using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) algorithm.  The robot will consist of a two-wheeled platform (e.g., simulated or a small physical platform) controlled via motor drivers.  The goal is to implement a PID controller that maintains the robot's balance by adjusting motor speeds based on sensor readings (e.g., simulated or from an IMU). This project focuses on the control algorithm, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with NumPy and SciPy for numerical computation)
- **Simulation Environment:** Pygame (for visual simulation) or V-REP/CoppeliaSim (for more realistic simulation).  Alternatively, a physical robot platform (e.g., Arduino with motor drivers and an MPU6050 IMU) could be used.
- **Libraries:**  `pygame`, `numpy`, `scipy.signal` (for PID controller implementation)
- **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino Uno, motor drivers (e.g., L298N), MPU6050 IMU, two DC motors, battery.

## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain an upright position despite disturbances (e.g., simulated pushes or minor external forces).
- **PID Control Implementation:** A functional PID controller with adjustable gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) should be implemented.
- **Sensor Integration (Simulated or Real):**  The controller should utilize sensor data (angle and angular velocity) to adjust motor speeds.
- **Real-time Control Loop:**  The control loop should run at a sufficient rate (e.g., 100Hz) for stable balance.
- **Visualization (Simulation):**  A visual representation of the robot's state (angle, motor speeds) should be provided.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a self-tuning PID controller that automatically adjusts gains based on system performance.
- **Optional Feature:**  Add a user interface (GUI) for controlling PID gains and observing sensor data in real-time.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries and set up the chosen simulation environment (or connect physical hardware).
2. **Implement PID Controller:** Create a PID controller class with methods for calculating control output based on error, integral, and derivative terms.
3. **Sensor Data Integration:**  Implement code to read sensor data (simulated or real) representing the robot's angle and angular velocity.
4. **Control Loop Implementation:**  Create a main loop that continuously reads sensor data, calculates the control output using the PID controller, and updates motor speeds (simulated or real).
5. **Visualization/Testing:**  Run the simulation or deploy to the physical robot and test the controller's performance, adjusting PID gains as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging.  Start with small gains and iteratively adjust them to achieve stable and responsive balance.  Consider using techniques like Ziegler-Nichols method.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world sensors are noisy.  Implementing appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) might be necessary to improve controller robustness.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** This project provides hands-on experience in implementing and tuning PID controllers, a fundamental control algorithm in robotics and many other fields.
- **Real-time Systems:**  The project reinforces understanding of real-time control loops and the challenges of working with sensor data in a time-critical environment.
