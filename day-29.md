# Mini-Game AI Agent for a Simple 2D Environment

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of playing a basic 2D game, such as navigating a maze or collecting items, within a limited timeframe. The goal is to implement a basic reinforcement learning algorithm to train the agent to achieve a specific objective. This project allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation with AI techniques in a constrained environment.  The significance lies in the practical application of reinforcement learning concepts within a readily achievable scope.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development and visualization), NumPy (for numerical operations), and a reinforcement learning library like Stable Baselines3 or RLlib (depending on chosen algorithm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Environment Creation:**  A simple 2D game environment (e.g., maze) needs to be created using Pygame.
- **Agent Implementation:** An AI agent that can perceive the environment (e.g., using a vision system to detect walls, items) and take actions (e.g., move up, down, left, right).
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:** Implementation of a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler variant) to train the agent.
- **Reward System:** Defining a reward function that guides the agent towards the desired objective (e.g., reaching the exit in a maze, collecting all items).
- **Visualization:** Display of the game environment and the agent's actions in real-time using Pygame.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Incorporate a simple form of memory into the agent's decision-making process.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the basic 2D game environment using Pygame. Define the game rules, rewards, and the agent's possible actions.
2. **Agent Design:**  Implement the agent's perception and action mechanisms.  This might involve simple raycasting for detecting obstacles.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Implementation:** Choose a simple algorithm (like Q-learning) and implement its core components: state representation, action selection, reward update, and Q-table (or similar).
4. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively runs the agent in the environment, updates the Q-table, and observes the agent's performance.
5. **Visualization and Evaluation:** Display the game environment and the agent's progress. Evaluate the agent's performance using metrics like success rate or steps to completion.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Convergence:**  Simple reinforcement learning algorithms can struggle with convergence in complex environments. Consider using techniques like exploration/exploitation trade-offs (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to mitigate this.
- **State Representation:** Choosing an efficient and effective way to represent the agent's state is crucial.  A poor state representation can significantly hinder learning.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience with implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.
- Deeper understanding of the core concepts of reinforcement learning (e.g., reward, state, action, Q-value).
- Improved proficiency in using Pygame for game development and visualization.
