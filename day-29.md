# Automated Code Style Enforcement with Real-time Feedback

## Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight tool that automatically enforces a chosen coding style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) in real-time while a developer is writing code.  This provides immediate feedback, improving code quality and consistency without requiring separate linting or formatting steps.  The significance lies in reducing the friction associated with style enforcement, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Framework:  None (a simple script will suffice)
- Libraries: `pylint`, `rope`, or similar for code analysis and manipulation.
- Tools: Text editor with plugin support (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) or a custom simple GUI (using `tkinter` or `PyQt`).  Optionally, a language server protocol (LSP) integration for more advanced editors.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time linting:**  The tool should analyze the code as it's typed and highlight style violations instantly.
- **Automatic formatting suggestions:**  Upon detecting a style violation, the tool should suggest a correction or provide clear instructions on how to fix it.
- **Configurable style guide:**  Users should be able to choose which style guide to enforce (e.g., PEP 8, Google Python Style Guide).
- **Customizable severity levels:**  Allow users to set the severity levels for different style violations (warnings, errors).
- **Integration with text editor (optional):**  The tool could be integrated as a plugin for popular text editors for a seamless experience.

- **Advanced Features:**
    - **Automated code correction:**  Automatically fix minor style violations (e.g., whitespace issues).
    - **Metrics Reporting:**  Generate simple metrics on code style adherence.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Choose a code analysis library:** Select `pylint`, `rope`, or a similar library suitable for the chosen language.
2. **Implement real-time analysis:**  Use the library to parse and analyze the code as the user types.  This might involve using a timer to trigger analysis periodically or employing techniques to detect changes in the code efficiently.
3. **Create a feedback mechanism:**  Highlight style violations directly in the editor (if using plugin integration) or provide console-based feedback if creating a standalone tool.
4. **Add style guide configuration:**  Implement a mechanism (e.g., a configuration file) to allow users to select the style guide and customize severity levels.
5. **Develop a user interface (optional):**  If aiming for a more user-friendly experience, develop a simple GUI to display results and manage settings.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Performance:**  Real-time analysis of large codebases can be computationally expensive.  Strategies for optimizing performance (e.g., incremental parsing) will be crucial.
- **Accuracy:**  Code analysis libraries may not always be perfectly accurate.  Careful selection and testing of the library are essential.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of code style best practices:**  This project will reinforce the importance of following coding style guidelines and their impact on code readability and maintainability.
- **Experience with code analysis tools and techniques:**  The project provides practical experience in using and integrating code analysis libraries and implementing real-time feedback mechanisms.
