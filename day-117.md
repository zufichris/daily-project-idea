# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, using reinforcement learning (RL). The goal is to build a basic RL agent capable of learning optimal strategies within a short timeframe, demonstrating core RL concepts and providing a functional, albeit limited, AI opponent.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for RL algorithms (Q-learning or a simplified version of Deep Q-Network would be suitable).
- IDE:  Any Python-friendly IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An RL agent that learns through trial and error against a random opponent or itself.
    - Visualization of the learning process (e.g., win rate over time).
    - Ability to play against the trained AI agent.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Double DQN).
    -  Saving and loading trained models for future use.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Environment:** Create a simple game environment using Python and a library like OpenAI Gym, or build a custom environment from scratch for a simpler game like Tic-Tac-Toe.
2. **Choose an RL Algorithm:** Select a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning). Implement the chosen algorithm, focusing on the core logic of state-action value updates.
3. **Train the Agent:** Train the RL agent by letting it play numerous games against a random opponent or itself. Monitor the learning progress and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
4. **Test and Evaluate:** Play against the trained agent to assess its performance and observe its learned strategies.
5. **Visualization and Refinement:** Implement a simple visualization to display learning curves (win rate, average reward).  Iterate and refine the agent's learning parameters for better performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) for the RL algorithm can be challenging and may require experimentation.
- **Computational Resources:** Training the agent, especially with more complex algorithms or larger state spaces, might demand a certain amount of computational power.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementation.
- Understanding of the key components of an RL agent (environment, agent, reward, policy).
- Enhanced skills in Python programming and utilization of relevant libraries for AI development.
