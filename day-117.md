# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, robust prototype for controlling smart home devices using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of predefined gestures, providing a hands-free and intuitive interaction method. This differs from existing solutions by its focus on speed of prototyping and simplicity, making it ideal for a daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for gesture recognition), a suitable smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).
- **Tools:** Webcam, IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), potentially a virtual environment.

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, thumbs up).
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Control at least one smart home device (e.g., a smart light) based on recognized gestures.  This could involve toggling ON/OFF or adjusting brightness.
- **Real-time Processing:** Process webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **User Interface:** A simple display showing the currently recognized gesture and the status of the controlled device.
- **Calibration:** Allow for basic calibration to account for variations in lighting and hand positioning.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement gesture sequence recognition (e.g., two consecutive gestures for more complex actions).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Integrate with multiple smart home devices and control parameters beyond simple ON/OFF (e.g., volume, temperature).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Environment:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe), and test webcam connectivity.
2. **Gesture Recognition Pipeline:** Implement the core gesture recognition using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution. Focus on processing the detected landmarks to classify the three chosen gestures.
3. **Smart Home Integration:** Integrate with a chosen smart home API.  This involves setting up authentication and learning how to send commands to control the desired device.
4. **User Interface:** Develop a simple UI (e.g., using OpenCV's display functions) to visualize the detected gesture and device status.
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Test the entire system, refine gesture recognition accuracy, and improve the robustness of the system to lighting and background changes.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in hand size, lighting conditions, and background clutter.  Addressing this will require careful tuning of parameters and possibly the addition of data augmentation techniques (if time permits).
- **Latency:** Real-time processing requires efficient code and optimized algorithms to minimize latency between gesture detection and device control.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** This project strengthens understanding of real-time image processing, object detection, and feature extraction techniques.
- **API Integration:**  Hands-on experience in integrating software with external APIs and services, a crucial skill for many software engineering projects.
