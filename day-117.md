# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus is on creating a robust and responsive system capable of recognizing a small set of predefined gestures within a limited timeframe. This offers a novel, hands-free interaction method compared to traditional voice or app-based control.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  a suitable machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn for simpler models, TensorFlow/PyTorch for more advanced ones).
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).  A simple smart home simulator or integration with a real smart home system (optional).

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open hand, fist, thumbs up) with high accuracy.
- **Real-time Processing:** Process webcam feed in real-time, providing immediate feedback on gesture recognition.
- **Device Control:**  Map recognized gestures to specific smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).
- **User Calibration:** Allow the system to adapt to individual user's hand movements and gestures.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement gesture sequencing for more complex commands.
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a physical smart home system (requires additional setup and configuration).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:** Capture a dataset of images/videos demonstrating the chosen gestures. This can be done quickly by recording short video clips.
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., a Support Vector Machine or a small neural network) using the captured dataset to classify gestures. Focus on a model that can be trained quickly.
3. **Real-time Processing Integration:** Integrate the trained model with OpenCV and MediaPipe to process webcam feed in real-time, classify gestures, and output the recognized gesture.
4. **Smart Home Control Integration:** Implement the mapping between recognized gestures and smart home actions.  This could initially be simulated with print statements indicating the action, before integrating with a smart home API.
5. **Refinement and Testing:** Test the system, refine the model, and improve accuracy through iterative testing and adjustments.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of hand tracking and gesture recognition.  Consider using image preprocessing techniques to mitigate this.
- **Gesture Variability:**  Different users perform the same gesture in slightly different ways.  Data augmentation and a robust model are essential to address this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical skills in computer vision, machine learning, and real-time processing.** This project involves building a complete pipeline, from data collection to deployment, within a short time frame.
- **Develop proficiency in using libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe.** This hands-on experience will solidify understanding of these powerful tools.
