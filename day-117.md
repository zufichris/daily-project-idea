# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated or physical self-balancing two-wheeled robot.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing and control of the robot's posture using a simplified model. This is a classic control systems problem that allows for quick prototyping and iterative improvements within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID control), Pygame (for simulation, optional) or a robotics library like ROS (for physical robot).
- **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino, motor driver, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), two DC motors, chassis for a physical robot.
- **Simulation Environment (Optional):**  Pygame or a physics engine like PyBullet.

## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Control:** The robot should maintain an upright position when disturbed.
- **PID Implementation:**  A functional PID controller should be implemented to manage motor speeds based on angle and angular velocity readings.
- **Sensor Input Simulation (or Reading):**  Simulate sensor data (angle, angular velocity) or interface with a physical IMU.
- **Motor Control Simulation (or Actuation):** Simulate motor responses or control actual motors based on PID output.
- **Stability Analysis:** Observe and record the robot's response to various disturbances (e.g., simulated pushes).

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementation of a Kalman filter for sensor fusion to improve robustness against noise.  Addition of a control loop for forward/backward movement.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Model Setup:** Create a simplified model of the robot's dynamics (either through simulation or by identifying relevant parameters for a physical robot).
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID controller algorithm using the chosen library (SciPy's `pid` function is recommended). Tune initial PID gains (K_p, K_i, K_d) using simple trial and error.
3. **Sensor Integration:**  Integrate sensor data (simulated or real) to provide feedback to the PID controller.
4. **Motor Control:**  Send control signals (motor speeds) to the robot based on PID output.  This could involve direct motor control if using a physical robot or simulated motor responses in a simulation environment.
5. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the robot's stability and responsiveness. Iteratively adjust PID gains to optimize performance. Analyze the response to disturbances and refine the gains to achieve optimal stability.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments based on observation and understanding of the system's response.  Using a systematic tuning method is helpful.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world sensor readings will contain noise; techniques for noise reduction (e.g., filtering) might be necessary for robust performance in a physical system.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control Implementation:**  Gain practical experience with implementing and tuning PID controllers, a fundamental control system technique.
- **System Modeling and Simulation:** Understanding how to simplify complex systems into manageable models for simulation and analysis. (If using simulation).
