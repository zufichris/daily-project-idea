# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a basic real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and a pre-trained machine learning model.  The goal is to demonstrate the integration of computer vision and embedded systems for a practical application, such as monitoring a specific area for the presence or movement of certain objects. This can be a stepping stone to more complex robotics applications involving object manipulation or autonomous navigation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar), Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2, power supply.
* **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (or similar lightweight ML framework), potentially a web framework like Flask for remote visualization (optional).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time video capture:** Capture video from the Raspberry Pi camera.
- **Object detection:** Detect objects within the video stream using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model (e.g., MobileNet SSD).
- **Object classification:** Classify detected objects into predefined categories (e.g., person, car, bicycle).
- **Bounding box display:** Draw bounding boxes around detected objects on the video stream, displaying classification labels.
- **Basic tracking:**  Track the centroid of detected objects across frames (simple tracking, not sophisticated multi-object tracking).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implement more robust object tracking using algorithms like Kalman filtering.
    - Add a web interface using Flask to remotely view the video stream and tracking results.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Install necessary packages (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) on the Raspberry Pi.  Configure the camera module.
2. **Model Loading and Preprocessing:** Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., a MobileNet SSD model converted to TensorFlow Lite).  Prepare any necessary image preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization).
3. **Video Capture and Object Detection:**  Capture video frames from the camera, run the object detection model on each frame, and extract bounding boxes and classification labels.
4. **Bounding Box Drawing and Display:** Draw the bounding boxes and labels onto the video frames using OpenCV's drawing functions. Display the resulting video stream on the Raspberry Pi screen (or optionally stream via a web interface).
5. **Basic Tracking Implementation:**  Calculate the centroid of each detected object and track its movement across frames using a simple algorithm (e.g., comparing centroids between consecutive frames).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:**  The Raspberry Pi may struggle with real-time processing, especially with high-resolution video or complex models.  Consider reducing the resolution or using a more lightweight model.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right pre-trained model is crucial for accuracy and performance. The model must be compatible with TensorFlow Lite and optimized for low-power devices.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Integration:** Gain experience integrating computer vision algorithms with an embedded system.
- **Real-time Processing:** Understand the challenges and techniques involved in processing video data in real-time on a resource-constrained device.
