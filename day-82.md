# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Webcam

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's view, providing its location (coordinates) and classification confidence. This is a practical application of computer vision techniques useful in various fields from robotics to surveillance.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- TensorFlow/Keras (or other deep learning framework like PyTorch)
- A webcam

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time video processing:**  Capture and process webcam frames at a reasonable frame rate (at least 10 FPS).
- **Object detection:** Detect the presence of the target object (pre-defined) within each frame.
- **Object tracking:** Track the object's movement across consecutive frames.
- **Classification confidence:** Display the confidence level of the object classification.
- **Coordinate display:** Show the object's (bounding box) center coordinates on the video feed.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement object counting (counting instances of the target object).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Allow the user to select the target object through a simple interface (e.g., selecting a region of interest in the first frame).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Data Loading:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras). Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5, or train a simple model on a small dataset if time permits).
2. **Webcam Access and Preprocessing:** Access the webcam feed using OpenCV.  Preprocess frames (resize, color conversion if necessary).
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Implement object detection using the loaded model. Use a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, simple centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Display and Output:** Overlay bounding boxes, confidence scores, and coordinates on the video stream.  Display the output in a window.
5. **Refinement and Testing:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and object positions. Refine parameters of the detection and tracking algorithms to improve accuracy and performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational performance:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive.  Optimize the code and consider using efficient algorithms and models.  Lowering resolution or reducing frame rate might be necessary for slow machines.
- **Object occlusion:** The system's performance might degrade if the target object is partially or completely occluded.  Exploring more robust tracking algorithms could mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of object detection and tracking techniques.
- Experience with OpenCV for video processing and manipulation.
- Understanding the challenges of real-time computer vision and potential optimization strategies.
