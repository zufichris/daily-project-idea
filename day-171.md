# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts within a short timeframe. The game will be sufficiently simple to allow for significant progress within a day or two, showcasing the power and elegance of RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, optional pre-built environments can be used), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning model), NumPy (for numerical computation).
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation).


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A simple grid-based game (e.g., a simplified version of Pac-Man, grid-based navigation with rewards/penalties).
- **Agent Training:** The agent should learn through reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA) to maximize its reward.
- **Reward System:** A clear reward system defining success and failure in the game.
- **Action Space:**  A limited set of actions for the agent (e.g., move up, down, left, right).
- **Visualization:** Basic visualization of the agent's progress within the game environment.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Hyperparameter tuning to optimize learning speed and performance.  Experimentation with different RL algorithms.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment using OpenAI Gym or create a custom environment.  This includes specifying the game state, actions, rewards, and rendering.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity) and implement the agent's learning logic. This includes defining the state-action value function (Q-table or neural network).
3. **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop to iteratively interact with the environment, observe rewards, update the agent's policy, and collect data.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent in the environment and visualize its performance. Record key metrics such as average reward and steps to completion.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** Based on the evaluation, adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor), algorithm choices, or environment complexity.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Overfitting:**  The agent might overfit to the specific environment, hindering its generalization ability. This can be addressed by carefully designing the environment and using techniques like experience replay.
- **Computational Cost:**  Training time can be a significant constraint.  The challenge lies in finding a balance between environment complexity and training time for a one- or two-day project.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with core RL concepts, such as rewards, states, actions, policies, and the learning process.
- **Python Programming and Library Usage:**  Strengthen proficiency in Python and relevant libraries like OpenAI Gym, TensorFlow/Keras, and NumPy.
