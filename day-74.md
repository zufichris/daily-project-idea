# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a simple, low-cost webcam and machine learning to recognize micro-gestures.  The system will translate these gestures into commands for controlling smart home devices like lights, thermostats, or media players.  This addresses the need for intuitive and hands-free control, expanding beyond voice-activated systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite/scikit-learn (for machine learning model)
* **Tools:**  A webcam,  Jupyter Notebook or IDE (PyCharm, VS Code)

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  Real-time capture and processing of hand gestures from a webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Training a simple machine learning model (e.g., a small CNN or a simpler model like SVM/RandomForest if time is extremely limited) to recognize predefined micro-gestures (e.g., hand wave for lights on/off, fist for volume up/down).
- **Command Execution:**  Integration with a simple smart home simulator (or a mock API) to execute commands based on recognized gestures.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Visual feedback (e.g., on-screen display of recognized gesture) to the user.
- **Data Logging:** Optionally, log gesture data for model improvement.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Gesture Customization:**  Allow users to define and train their own custom gestures.
- **Multi-user Support:** Extend the system to recognize gestures from multiple users simultaneously.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture a small dataset of predefined micro-gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe.  This might involve recording short video clips of each gesture and extracting relevant frames. Preprocess the data (resize images, normalize pixel values).
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model on the captured dataset to classify the different gestures.  For a quick prototype, a smaller and faster model might be preferable.
3. **Gesture Recognition Pipeline:** Integrate the trained model into a real-time gesture recognition pipeline using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Process webcam frames continuously, predict gestures, and provide visual feedback.
4. **Command Execution:** Implement the logic to map recognized gestures to commands and simulate control of smart home devices. This can be a simple mapping or a more sophisticated system if time permits.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system's accuracy and responsiveness. Iterate on data acquisition, model training, or parameter tuning if necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:**  Gathering sufficient and diverse training data for accurate gesture recognition within a short timeframe can be challenging. Focus on a few key gestures to make this more manageable.
- **Model Complexity:**  Balancing model accuracy and training time is crucial.  Consider simpler models initially and add complexity only if time allows.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical experience with OpenCV and MediaPipe for computer vision tasks.**
- **Gain hands-on experience in building and deploying a simple machine learning model for real-time application.**
