# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robotic Object Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system that leverages AI for improved object recognition in a robotic environment. The system will take an image as input from a robot's camera, generate a descriptive caption using a pre-trained image captioning model, and then use this caption to inform the robot's actions, improving its understanding of the scene. This is particularly relevant for robots operating in unstructured environments where precise object identification is challenging.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), PyTorch/TensorFlow (for deep learning), transformers (for captioning model), a robotic control library (e.g., ROS, PyBullet, depending on the robot)
- **Pre-trained Model:** A readily available image captioning model like CLIP or similar (e.g., from Hugging Face).
- **Hardware (optional):** A simulated robot environment (PyBullet) or a physical robot with a camera.


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition:** Capture an image from a simulated or real camera.
- **Caption Generation:** Generate a descriptive caption for the image using a pre-trained image captioning model.
- **Object Identification:**  Identify key objects and their attributes mentioned in the generated caption.
- **Action Triggering (Simulated):** Based on identified objects, trigger a predefined action in a simulated environment (e.g., pick up an object, move towards it).
- **Output Display:** Display the original image, the generated caption, and the robot's planned action.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement basic natural language understanding to handle more complex captions and actions (e.g., “Pick up the red ball next to the blue box”).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate with a speech synthesis system to audibly announce the caption and planned action.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained image captioning model. Set up a simulated robot environment (if using one).
2. **Image Input and Captioning:** Write code to capture an image, preprocess it (resizing, etc.), and use the pre-trained model to generate a caption.
3. **Object Recognition and Action Planning:** Implement logic to parse the caption, identify key objects, and map those objects to corresponding robotic actions.
4. **Action Execution (Simulation):** If using a simulator, implement the robotic actions based on the planned actions.  Log the results.
5. **Output and Visualization:** Display the image, caption, identified objects, and planned/executed actions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Captioning Model:** Pre-trained models might not be perfect; handling ambiguous or inaccurate captions requires robust error handling.  Consider incorporating confidence scores from the captioning model.
- **Real-world vs. Simulation:** If using a physical robot, real-world factors like lighting, camera calibration, and robot control precision will introduce additional complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of AI-powered image processing and captioning:** Practical application of pre-trained models and their integration with other systems.
- **Develop skills in robotic control and action planning:**  Gain experience in translating high-level descriptions into robot actions.
