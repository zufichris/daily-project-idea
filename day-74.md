# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic self-balancing control system for a robotic arm using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The goal is to maintain a specific target angle for the arm, despite disturbances or external forces. This demonstrates a fundamental control algorithm widely used in robotics and automation.  A simplified simulation or physical prototype (using a small servo motor and microcontroller) is feasible within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below) or C++ (Arduino IDE)
* **Libraries:**  Python - `Pygame` (for visualization, optional), `control` (for PID controller implementation) or equivalent for C++
* **Hardware (Optional):**  Arduino Uno/Nano, servo motor, sensor (e.g., potentiometer for angle measurement).
* **Software:**  Arduino IDE (if using hardware), a suitable Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Angle Target Setting:**  The user should be able to specify a target angle for the robotic arm.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to accurately maintain the specified target angle.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should continuously monitor the current angle and adjust the servo motor accordingly.
- **Error Visualization (Optional):**  Visual representation of the error between the target and current angle.
- **Stability Test (Optional):**  Simulate or physically apply a small disturbance to test the system’s ability to recover.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Choose either a simulation environment or prepare the hardware.  For simulation, set up a basic model using `Pygame` (optional visualization) or a simpler mathematical model. For hardware, connect the servo motor and sensor to the Arduino.
2. **Sensor Reading & Angle Calculation:** Implement code to read the sensor data (simulated or physical) and calculate the current angle of the robotic arm.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement the PID control algorithm, tuning the Kp, Ki, and Kd gains to optimize performance and stability.
4. **Servo Motor Control:**  Use the PID output to control the servo motor, adjusting its position to correct the arm’s angle.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the system's ability to maintain the target angle and fine-tune the PID gains for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains requires careful experimentation and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with conservative values and incrementally adjust.
- **Sensor Noise:**  Physical sensor readings can be noisy.  Implement appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) to mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Algorithm:** Gain practical experience implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Real-time Systems:**  Develop a better understanding of real-time feedback systems and the challenges involved in building responsive and stable control loops.
