# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimal version of a classic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Nim) using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on building a functional, albeit basic, AI that demonstrates core RL concepts within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in applying a powerful AI technique to a constrained problem domain, enabling rapid prototyping and iteration.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `gym` (for environment creation, optional), `numpy`, potentially `tensorflow`/`keras` (if time allows for a neural network approach)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional implementation of a simple game (e.g., a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board).
- **Agent Initialization:**  An AI agent initialized with a basic strategy (e.g., random moves).
- **Reinforcement Learning Loop:** A core RL loop implementing a simple algorithm like Q-learning.
- **Reward System:** A clear reward function defining the agent's success (e.g., +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, 0 for a draw).
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Basic metrics to track the agent's learning progress (e.g., win rate over a set number of games).

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Implement a simple neural network for the Q-function approximation instead of a table-based approach.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Integrate the environment and agent into a visual display using a library like Pygame.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the game environment, defining rules, state representation, and a method for taking actions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Create the AI agent, initialize its Q-table (or neural network if advanced feature 1 is chosen), and implement the chosen RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).
3. **Training Loop:** Implement the main training loop, iterating over many games, updating the agent's Q-values based on rewards received.
4. **Evaluation:** Run the trained agent against a simple opponent (e.g., a random player) to evaluate its performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If time permits and advanced feature 2 is selected, create a visual representation of the game and agent's progress.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**  Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions can be challenging.  Experiment with different exploration strategies (e.g., Îµ-greedy).
- **Choosing the Right RL Algorithm:**  Selecting a suitable algorithm for the chosen game's complexity is crucial.  Q-learning is a good starting point, but more advanced techniques may be necessary for more complex games.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like Q-learning, rewards, and state-action spaces.
- **AI Agent Design:**  The project helps solidify the principles of designing and implementing AI agents to solve specific problems.
