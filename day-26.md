# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple calibration system for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The system will utilize a known calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) to determine the robot's end-effector pose (position and orientation) relative to the camera.  This is crucial for precise robotic manipulation tasks and can be a significant improvement over manual calibration methods.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm SDK (depending on the specific arm used).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, low-cost one), a webcam or camera, and a printed checkerboard pattern.

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition:** Capture images of the checkerboard pattern from the camera at various known robot arm poses.
- **Checkerboard Detection:** Use OpenCV to detect and locate the checkerboard corners in each image.
- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera using OpenCV's camera calibration functions to determine intrinsic parameters (focal length, distortion coefficients).
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the pose of the checkerboard (and hence the robot's end-effector) in each image using OpenCV's solvePnP function.
- **Data Output:**  Output the calculated poses for each image.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a basic inverse kinematics (IK) solution to move the robotic arm to specific target locations based on the calculated camera-robot transformation.
- **Optional Feature:** Visualize the calibration results using a 3D plot showing the calculated poses.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:**  Set up the camera and robotic arm, ensuring clear visibility of the checkerboard. Install necessary libraries.
2. **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture a series of images with the robotic arm in various positions.  Use OpenCV to detect checkerboard corners in each image.
3. **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera using OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function.
4. **Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to estimate the pose of the checkerboard in each image, utilizing the camera calibration parameters.
5. **Data Output/Visualization:** Store and display the calculated poses. Optionally, create a 3D visualization.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy depends on image quality, lighting conditions, and the precision of the robotic arm's movements. Careful consideration of these factors is crucial.
- **Computational Cost:**  Processing images and performing pose estimation can be computationally intensive.  Optimize code for efficiency.

## Learning Outcomes
- This project reinforces practical skills in computer vision, specifically camera calibration and pose estimation using OpenCV.
- The project allows one to gain experience working with robotic arm control and integrating vision systems with robotics.
