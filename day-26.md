# Self-Balancing Robot PID Controller Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for a simulated or physical self-balancing robot.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing using a simple two-wheeled robot model. This provides a practical application of control theory principles within a limited timeframe.  The significance lies in understanding the impact of PID gains on system stability and response.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID controller implementation), Pygame (optional, for visualization)
* **Simulation Environment (Optional):**  V-REP, Gazebo, or a custom physics engine (if tackling a physical robot, this section is irrelevant).
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino or similar microcontroller, motor drivers, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), battery.

## Features & Requirements

- **Stable Balancing:** The robot should maintain an upright position despite disturbances.
- **PID Controller Implementation:** A functional PID controller should be implemented to regulate the motor speeds based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
- **Sensor Integration (Simulation):**  Accurate simulation of sensor readings (angle, angular velocity) from a virtual IMU.  (For physical robot: actual IMU reading).
- **Motor Control:**  The controller should send appropriate commands to the motors to correct imbalances.
- **Visual Feedback (Optional):** Real-time visualization of the robot's state (angle, motor speeds) using Pygame.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementation of a Kalman filter for sensor fusion and noise reduction.
- **Advanced Features:**  Adding disturbance rejection capabilities (e.g., reacting to external forces).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Setup:** Define the robot model (simple inverted pendulum) and simulate sensor data or connect to physical sensors.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID algorithm using NumPy/SciPy.  Initialize PID gains (K_p, K_i, K_d) with reasonable starting values.
3. **Control Loop:**  Create a control loop that continuously reads sensor data, calculates the control signal using the PID controller, and updates motor speeds (simulation or hardware).
4. **Tuning:**  Iteratively adjust the PID gains (K_p, K_i, K_d) to achieve optimal stability and response. Observe overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error.
5. **Testing & Evaluation:**  Test the controller's robustness by applying disturbances (simulated or physical) and evaluate its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments.  Consider using Ziegler-Nichols tuning methods or other automated tuning techniques.
- **Sensor Noise:**  Real-world sensors are noisy. Filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter, Kalman filter) might be necessary for robust performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:**  This project reinforces the understanding and practical application of PID controllers, a fundamental concept in control systems engineering.
- **System Stability:**  The project helps in understanding the relationship between PID gains and system stability, including concepts like overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error.
