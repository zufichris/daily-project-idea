# Mini-Game AI Agent for Existing Game

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple, yet effective AI agent capable of playing a pre-existing, turn-based game (e.g., a simplified version of Connect Four, Tic-Tac-Toe with variations, or a custom-designed text-based game).  The agent will utilize a reinforcement learning approach, specifically Q-learning, to improve its gameplay over a series of self-play iterations.  The significance lies in building a functional AI agent within a short timeframe using a well-understood algorithm, highlighting the core principles of reinforcement learning in a practical context.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical operations),  a game library (Pygame for visualization if desired, or a custom-built game engine).
- **Reinforcement Learning Library (optional):** Consider Stable Baselines3 for a more advanced implementation if time permits.


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Engine:** A simple, text-based or graphical representation of the chosen game.
- **Q-Learning Agent:** An AI agent implementing the Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal strategies.
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism for the agent to play against itself repeatedly and update its Q-table.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics (win rate, average moves) to track the agent's progress.
- **Game State Representation:**  A concise way to represent the game state (e.g., a NumPy array for a board game).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Exploration-exploitation strategies (e.g., Îµ-greedy) for improved learning.  GUI for visualizing the game and agent's actions (using Pygame).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Define the game rules and create the game engine. This might involve creating classes for the game board, players, and actions.  Choose a simple game.
2. **Q-Table Initialization:** Initialize the Q-table, a data structure that maps game states to action values.
3. **Q-Learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning update rule.  This will involve iteratively playing the game, updating the Q-table based on rewards received, and using the Q-table to select actions.
4. **Training Loop:** Run the training loop for a defined number of iterations or until a satisfactory performance level is achieved.
5. **Evaluation:**  Test the trained agent against a random player or a human player to assess its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Space Explosion:** For complex games, the Q-table can become very large.  Consider state aggregation or function approximation techniques (if time allows) to address this.
- **Reward Function Design:** Choosing an appropriate reward function is crucial. A poorly designed reward function can lead to unexpected behavior.  A simple reward system (e.g., +1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 otherwise) is sufficient for a basic implementation.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of the Q-learning algorithm in a real-world setting.
- Reinforcement of concepts in state representation, action selection, and reward functions within reinforcement learning.
