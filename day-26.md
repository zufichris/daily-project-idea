# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimal 2D game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be a custom-designed, easily implementable environment, allowing for rapid iteration and testing of different reinforcement learning algorithms.  The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL within a constrained timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- Pygame (for game development)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:** A simple 2D game (e.g., navigating a maze to collect points, avoiding obstacles) with clear state representation and reward structure.
- **Agent Implementation:** A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA) to learn optimal actions within the game environment.
- **Training Loop:** A training loop to iteratively update the agent's policy based on interactions with the game.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics to track the agent's learning progress (e.g., average reward per episode).
- **Visualization:** Simple visualization of the agent's actions and learning progress within the game.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm like Deep Q-Network (DQN) for improved performance.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Adding a simple GUI for user interaction and parameter adjustment during training.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Design & Implement the Game:** Create a basic 2D game environment using Pygame.  Focus on simplicityâ€”a small maze or simple grid-based game will suffice.
2. **Define State & Reward:** Clearly define the game's state representation (e.g., agent position, obstacle locations) and the reward function (e.g., points for collecting items, penalties for collisions).
3. **Implement RL Agent:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity) and implement it using PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Training and Evaluation:** Run the training loop, logging performance metrics and visualizing the agent's progress.
5. **Analyze Results:**  Evaluate the agent's performance and explore potential improvements (e.g., adjusting hyperparameters, trying a different RL algorithm).


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal agent behavior. Careful consideration is crucial.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the chosen RL algorithm may require experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Experience with designing and implementing game environments.
- Understanding of key RL concepts like state, action, reward, policy, and value functions.
