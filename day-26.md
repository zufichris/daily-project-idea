# Robotic Arm Calibration and Control via GUI

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to calibrate and control a robotic arm, specifically targeting precise positional control.  The goal is to demonstrate accurate control through a user-friendly interface, laying the foundation for more complex robotic manipulation tasks. This is particularly useful for quick prototyping and testing various control algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Robotics Library:** Pygame (for GUI), robotic arm library (e.g., `roboticstoolbox`, depends on specific hardware) â€“ alternatively, a serial communication library if controlling via microcontroller.
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple, low-DOF arm is sufficient), microcontroller (optional, depending on the arm's control method).
* **GUI Framework:** Pygame (simple and quick to implement) or PyQt/Tkinter (for more sophisticated interfaces if time allows).


## Features & Requirements

- **GUI for Joint Control:**  Allows users to manually adjust each joint angle of the robotic arm using sliders or input fields.
- **Real-time Position Feedback:** Displays the current position (angles and Cartesian coordinates) of the robotic arm on the GUI.
- **Calibration Routine:**  A simple calibration function to map the GUI inputs to the actual joint angles of the robotic arm (accounts for mechanical differences).
- **Basic Trajectory Planning:** Ability to input a target Cartesian coordinate and the arm attempts to reach that position (simple inverse kinematics can be used).
- **Data Logging:** Logs joint angles and Cartesian coordinates for analysis.


- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated inverse kinematics algorithm for better accuracy and reach.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add collision detection to prevent the arm from colliding with itself or obstacles.


## Implementation Steps

1. **GUI Setup:** Create a basic Pygame window with sliders/input fields for each joint angle and display areas for position feedback.
2. **Hardware Interface:** Establish communication with the robotic arm (serial communication or using the relevant robotic library).
3. **Calibration:** Develop a simple calibration routine (e.g., setting known angles and recording the actual positions).
4. **Control Loop:** Implement the core control loop, sending commands to the arm based on GUI inputs and displaying feedback.
5. **Trajectory Planning (Optional):** Implement a basic inverse kinematics solution (e.g., Jacobian transpose method) to allow Cartesian coordinate input.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hardware Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility between the chosen robotic arm and the libraries/communication protocols.  This may require adapting code to match specific hardware specifications.
- **Inverse Kinematics:** Implementing an accurate and efficient inverse kinematics algorithm can be computationally intensive; for a daily challenge, a simplified approach might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Robotics Control:** Reinforces understanding of robotic arm kinematics and control principles.
- **GUI Development:** Provides practical experience in designing and implementing interactive GUIs for robotics applications.
