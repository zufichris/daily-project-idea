# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent using reinforcement learning to master a miniature game, specifically a customized version of the classic "Catch" game.  The significance lies in rapidly prototyping a reinforcement learning model and observing its learning process within a short timeframe.  This provides a hands-on experience with a powerful AI technique in a controlled environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Reinforcement Learning Library: Stable Baselines3
- Game Engine/Library: Pygame (for simple game creation) or a pre-built game library like Pyglet.
- IDE: VS Code or PyCharm

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple "Catch" game with a falling object and a moving paddle controlled by the AI.
    - An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
    -  Real-time visualization of the game and the AI's performance (score).
    -  Ability to save and load the trained AI model.
    -  Basic reward system (e.g., +1 for successful catch, -1 for miss).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Different game difficulty levels (faster falling objects).
    -  Implementation of a different reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create a basic "Catch" game using Pygame or a similar library.  Focus on simple, clean code to facilitate integration with the reinforcement learning library.
2. **Environment Wrapper:** Create a wrapper around the game environment to make it compatible with Stable Baselines3. This involves defining the observation space (game state), action space (paddle movement), and reward function.
3. **AI Training:** Utilize Stable Baselines3 to train a PPO agent on the custom environment.  Experiment with different hyperparameters for faster convergence.
4. **Evaluation & Refinement:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance. Adjust hyperparameters or the reward function based on its performance.  Save the best performing model.
5. **Visualization & Reporting:** Generate graphs or visualizations showcasing the AI's learning curve (e.g., reward over time).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the reinforcement learning algorithm can be time-consuming.  Start with default values and iteratively adjust based on the learning progress.
- **Reward Function Design:** A poorly designed reward function can hinder the AI's learning. Careful consideration is needed to ensure it effectively guides the agent towards the desired behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Practical experience in implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent using a popular library (Stable Baselines3).
- **Game AI Development:**  Understanding the process of integrating AI into a simple game environment, including environment creation and agent training.
