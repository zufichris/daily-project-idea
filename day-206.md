# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a prototype for a smart home control system using a micro-gesture recognition system via a webcam.  The goal is to create a simple, hands-free interface to control basic smart home functionalities (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume) using predefined hand gestures.  This avoids the need for voice commands or physical interfaces, offering a novel and potentially more convenient interaction method.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation), PyAutoGUI (for screen automation)
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with sufficient processing power.  A virtual environment is highly recommended.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, wave).
- **Action Mapping:** Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., thumbs up = increase volume, thumbs down = decrease volume, wave = turn lights off).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time to provide immediate response to gestures.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling to manage situations where gestures are not clearly detected.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide visual or auditory feedback to confirm gesture recognition and action execution.

- **Advanced Features:** Integrate with a specific smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant API).
- **Optional Feature:** Implement a simple training mechanism to allow users to customize gesture-action mappings.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment & Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI). Create a virtual environment for project isolation.
2. **Gesture Capture & Processing:**  Use MediaPipe to capture and process the webcam feed, extracting relevant hand pose information.
3. **Gesture Classification:**  Develop a simple classifier (e.g., using thresholds or basic machine learning) to distinguish between predefined gestures based on hand pose data.
4. **Action Execution:**  Use PyAutoGUI to send simulated keyboard/mouse inputs to control smart home functionalities (either simulated or via API calls if integrating with a smart home platform).
5. **Feedback Implementation:**  Add a visual or auditory cue (e.g., changing the webcam feed's color momentarily or playing a sound) to confirm successful gesture recognition and action execution.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness:**  Achieving reliable gesture recognition in varied lighting conditions and with different hand sizes/poses can be challenging.  Consider using more sophisticated image processing techniques if needed.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing real-time processing with accuracy can require optimization of the code.  Profiling the code to identify bottlenecks is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  Reinforce understanding of using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time video processing and gesture recognition.
- **System Integration:**  Gain experience in integrating different software components to build a functional system, and the challenges involved in real-time control applications.
