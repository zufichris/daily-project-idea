# Automated Code Style Enforcer for Python

## Overview

This project aims to build a command-line tool that automatically enforces a consistent coding style in Python projects using the `black` formatter and `flake8` linter.  The tool will prioritize speed and ease of integration into existing workflows, offering a quick way to maintain code quality. The significance lies in automating a tedious and error-prone manual process, saving developers valuable time and improving code maintainability.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.8+
- `black` (code formatter)
- `flake8` (linter)
- `argparse` (command-line argument parsing)
- `subprocess` (for running external commands)
- Optional: `pytest` (for unit testing)


## Features & Requirements

- **Automatic Formatting:** Automatically format Python code using `black`.
- **Linting:** Run `flake8` to detect style violations and potential errors.
- **Configurable Exclusions:** Allow users to specify files or directories to exclude from formatting and linting.
- **Verbose Output:** Provide detailed output showing which files were processed and any identified issues.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle potential errors such as file not found or permission issues.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integrate with a Git pre-commit hook to automatically format and lint code before each commit.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Generate a report summarizing linting and formatting results.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the project:** Create a new Python project, install `black` and `flake8` using `pip`.  Structure your code into modular functions for maintainability.
2. **Implement core functionality:** Write Python code using `argparse` to accept command-line arguments (input directory, exclusion patterns). Utilize `subprocess` to run `black` and `flake8` on specified files/directories.  Capture output and handle potential errors.
3. **Add verbose output and error handling:** Implement comprehensive logging to display the progress and results of formatting and linting.  Handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user.
4. **Test the functionality:** Test the tool with various input scenarios, including valid and invalid code, different file structures, and exclusion patterns.
5. **(Optional) Integrate advanced features:** If time allows, implement the Git pre-commit hook integration or the report generation feature.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Error handling for external commands:**  Handling potential errors from `black` and `flake8` (e.g., parsing errors, permission issues) requires robust error checking and informative feedback to the user.
- **Performance optimization:**  For large projects, processing time could be a concern. Optimizing the code to efficiently handle many files is important.  Consider using multiprocessing for large projects (advanced).


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of command-line argument parsing and working with external processes using `subprocess` in Python.
- Gain practical experience in automating repetitive tasks using scripting and leveraging existing tools like `black` and `flake8` to enhance developer workflow.
