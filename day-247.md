# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures. The system will leverage readily available hardware and cloud services for rapid prototyping, focusing on the integration of different input modalities.  This demonstrates a fusion of human-computer interaction techniques in a common smart home application.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework/Library:**  PyAutoGUI (gesture recognition), SpeechRecognition (voice recognition),  a suitable cloud platform API (e.g., Google Cloud's Dialogflow or Amazon Lex for NLP),  relevant libraries for controlling the chosen smart appliance (this will be appliance-specific).
* **Hardware:**  A webcam (for gesture recognition), a microphone (for voice recognition), and the target smart home appliance (e.g., a smart bulb controlled via its API).

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:** The system should respond to simple voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the lamp," "Increase brightness," etc.
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should recognize pre-defined hand gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, open palm for brightness up, closed fist for brightness down).
- **Appliance Integration:** Seamless integration with a specific smart home appliance's API (ensure API documentation is available).
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for situations like network issues, unrecognized commands, or failed gesture recognition.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual or auditory feedback to the user confirming successful command execution.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Extend to control multiple appliances simultaneously or sequentially.
- **Customizable Gestures/Commands:** Allow users to define their own gestures or voice commands.


## Implementation Steps

1. **API Setup & Testing:** Set up the chosen cloud platform API (Dialogflow, Lex, etc.) and create intents and entities for voice commands.  Test the API separately to ensure proper functioning.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate PyAutoGUI to recognize pre-defined gestures.  Calibrate the system and test the accuracy of gesture recognition.
3. **Voice Recognition Integration:** Integrate the SpeechRecognition library and connect it to the cloud platform API.  Test the voice recognition accuracy and handle potential errors.
4. **Appliance Control Integration:** Integrate the code to send commands to the smart appliance based on recognized voice or gesture input.  Test the entire system end-to-end.
5. **GUI Development (Optional):**  If time permits, create a simple GUI (using Tkinter or similar) to display status and allow manual override of commands.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture/Voice Recognition:**  Ensuring sufficient accuracy in real-time might require fine-tuning the models or using more advanced techniques.  Lighting conditions and background noise can heavily influence accuracy.
- **API Limitations:**  The chosen cloud platform API might have limitations on the number of requests or features.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcing skills in integrating different APIs and libraries for a cohesive application.
- Gaining experience in developing a system that uses multiple input modalities (voice and gesture) for human-computer interaction.
