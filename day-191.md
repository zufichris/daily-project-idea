# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL). The goal is to build a functional AI opponent that learns through trial and error within a short timeframe, showcasing the power and applicability of RL algorithms. The project emphasizes efficient implementation and focusing on core RL concepts.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  Gym (for environment creation, optional), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for RL algorithm), NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).
    - Training the agent against a random opponent or itself.
    -  Evaluation of the trained agent's performance against a simple rule-based opponent.
    - Basic logging of agent performance metrics (e.g., win rate).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    - Visualizing the agent's learning progress through graphs or plots.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Game Environment:** Define the game rules and create functions to handle game states, moves, and win/loss conditions.  For simplicity, a basic text-based interface can be used.
2. **Implement the RL Algorithm:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point) and implement its core logic, including reward functions, state-action mapping, and update rules.
3. **Train the Agent:**  Run the training loop, letting the agent play numerous games against a random or self-playing opponent.  Monitor performance metrics during training.
4. **Evaluate the Agent:**  After training, test the agent against a simple, rule-based opponent to assess its performance.
5. **Analyze & Refine (Optional):** Based on evaluation results, adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) or refine the reward function.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent toward optimal play is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions) is vital for effective learning.  This can be addressed through techniques like epsilon-greedy strategies.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of a reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Understanding of key RL concepts like state, action, reward, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma.
- Experience in designing and implementing a simple game AI.
