# Smart Home Energy Optimization Microservice

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a microservice that analyzes real-time energy consumption data from smart home devices and provides optimized energy usage recommendations.  The significance lies in its potential to reduce energy waste and contribute to a more sustainable smart home ecosystem.  This microservice will be designed for rapid prototyping and expansion.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with Flask or FastAPI for the microservice)
* **Data Handling:**  SQLite (for quick prototyping) or a cloud-based solution like Google Cloud Firestore.
* **Data Visualization:**  Simple plotting library like Matplotlib or a lightweight dashboard framework.
* **API Interaction:**  Libraries for interacting with smart home device APIs (e.g., Home Assistant API).  Note:  This may require existing smart home infrastructure.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Data Ingestion:**  The microservice should ingest energy consumption data from various sources (e.g., smart plugs, smart meters).
- **Energy Consumption Analysis:**  Calculate average, peak, and total energy consumption over specified timeframes.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual spikes or drops in energy consumption that might indicate malfunctions or inefficiencies.
- **Optimization Recommendations:** Provide suggestions for reducing energy consumption, such as turning off appliances during low-usage periods.
- **Data Reporting (Basic):**  Present key energy consumption metrics in a simple, user-friendly format (e.g., console output, simple plot).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Integration with a smart home automation system to automatically adjust appliance settings based on recommendations.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Predictive modeling to forecast future energy consumption based on historical data.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Source Setup:**  Establish a connection to a smart home energy data source (either simulated data or a real-world API).  If using simulated data, generate a realistic dataset.
2. **Microservice Development:** Create the core microservice using Python and a chosen framework (Flask/FastAPI). Implement data ingestion and basic analysis features.
3. **Anomaly Detection Algorithm:** Integrate a simple anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., moving average with thresholding) to identify unusual energy consumption patterns.
4. **Optimization Logic:** Develop the logic to generate energy optimization recommendations based on the analysis.
5. **Basic Reporting:** Implement basic data reporting (console output or simple plot) to visualize energy usage and recommendations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Integration:**  Connecting to various smart home device APIs can be challenging due to API differences and potential authentication issues.  Simulated data should be utilized initially.
- **Algorithm Accuracy:** The accuracy of the anomaly detection and optimization algorithms depends on the quality and quantity of the input data.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Microservice Architecture:**  Gain practical experience in designing and building a microservice using Python.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:**  Develop skills in data analysis techniques, including anomaly detection and visualization for energy consumption data.
