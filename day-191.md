# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and readily available machine learning models.  The goal is to detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view, displaying its location and classification on the screen. This is a practical demonstration of computer vision techniques, suitable for various applications like robotics or security monitoring.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (4 recommended), USB camera, monitor.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite or a similar lightweight machine learning framework, potentially a pre-trained model for object detection (e.g., MobileNet SSD).

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:** Detect a predefined object within the camera feed using a pre-trained model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across consecutive frames.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Display a bounding box around the tracked object on the camera feed.
- **Classification Confirmation:**  Display the classification (e.g., "red ball") near the bounding box.
- **Performance Metrics (Optional):** Calculate and display frames per second (FPS) for performance analysis.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple control mechanism (e.g., using keyboard input) to influence the tracking algorithm's sensitivity.
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a robotic arm for basic object manipulation (requires additional hardware).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) on the Raspberry Pi. Configure the camera and ensure it works correctly.  Download a suitable pre-trained model (consider size and accuracy trade-offs).
2. **Object Detection:** Integrate the chosen model with OpenCV to detect the target object within each frame from the camera.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using Kalman filtering or optical flow) to maintain the object's position across frames.
4. **Display & Output:** Overlay bounding boxes and classification labels onto the camera feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.  Display FPS if implementing performance metrics.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and object positions. Adjust parameters (e.g., model thresholds, tracking algorithm sensitivity) to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the FPS. Consider using a lightweight model and optimizing the code for performance.
- **Object occlusion:** The tracking algorithm may fail if the object is temporarily occluded.  Exploring more robust tracking algorithms might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of computer vision concepts like object detection, tracking, and bounding box representation.
- Practical experience with OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, and potentially Kalman filtering or optical flow techniques.
