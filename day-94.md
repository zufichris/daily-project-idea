# AI-Powered Smart Home Device Control via Voice

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary smart home control system using voice commands and an AI-powered speech recognition engine.  The system will control a simulated environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration without requiring physical hardware.  This simulates a real-world application while remaining achievable within a one- to two-day timeframe. The significance lies in exploring the integration of speech recognition and AI for controlling smart home devices, focusing on efficient implementation and user experience.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `SpeechRecognition` (for speech-to-text), `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech), a simple scripting language or framework for simulating device control (e.g., a dictionary or basic JSON configuration file).
- **Tools:**  A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), a virtual environment (recommended).

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Command Recognition:**  The system should accurately recognize and interpret pre-defined voice commands (e.g., "Turn on the lights," "Set the thermostat to 72 degrees," "Play music").
- **Simulated Device Control:**  The system should simulate the control of various smart home devices (lights, thermostat, music player) based on received commands.  The "devices" can be simple on/off flags or variables within the script.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle unrecognized commands or errors in the simulated device control.
- **Text-to-Speech Feedback:**  The system should provide verbal feedback confirming successful execution of commands or reporting errors.
- **Command History:**  A simple history of executed commands should be maintained and displayed.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Contextual Awareness:**  Implement basic contextual understanding, such as remembering the last-used device.
- **Customizable Commands:**  Allow users to add or modify voice commands via a simple configuration file.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment and Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries (`SpeechRecognition`, `pyttsx3`). Set up a virtual environment for project isolation.
2. **Implement Speech Recognition:** Integrate `SpeechRecognition` to capture and transcribe user voice input. Handle potential errors during speech recognition (e.g., network issues, audio input problems).
3. **Develop Command Parser and Device Simulator:** Create a simple system to parse recognized commands and map them to actions on simulated devices (e.g., a dictionary mapping voice commands to device functions).
4. **Integrate Text-to-Speech:** Use `pyttsx3` to provide verbal feedback to the user, confirming actions or indicating errors.
5. **Refine and Test:**  Iterate on the command parsing and error handling to enhance the robustness and user experience.  Conduct thorough testing with various commands and potential edge cases.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:**  Speech recognition can be sensitive to background noise and accents. Implement error handling to mitigate inaccurate transcriptions.
- **Robustness of Command Parsing:**  The command parsing logic needs to be flexible enough to handle variations in user input while remaining unambiguous.  Careful design of the command structure is crucial.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on experience with AI-powered speech recognition:** Develop skills in integrating and utilizing speech recognition libraries in a real-world scenario.
- **Understanding of simple AI-powered system design:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and testing a basic AI-powered control system, emphasizing efficient coding practices and error handling.
