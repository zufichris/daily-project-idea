# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simple, yet engaging, AI opponent for a classic game using reinforcement learning.  We'll leverage a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm to train an agent to play the game effectively within a short timeframe.  The chosen game will be Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing for rapid iteration and demonstration of core RL concepts. The significance lies in demonstrating the practical application of RL in a concise and easily understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch â€“ choose one)
- A suitable game engine (like Pygame for visualization, optional)


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Logic:** Implement the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.
- **AI Agent:** Develop a reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning or a similar algorithm.
- **Training Loop:** Create a training loop to allow the AI to learn through self-play.
- **Evaluation:**  Implement a method to evaluate the AI's performance against a random player or a simple rule-based strategy.
- **Basic Visualization (Optional):**  Display the game board and the AI's moves.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement an exploration-exploitation strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to balance exploration and exploitation during training.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor) to observe their impact on the AI's performance.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Logic:** Implement the core Tic-Tac-Toe game logic (board representation, win condition checking, move validation).
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for its simplicity). Implement the agent's state representation, action space, and Q-table (or neural network if using a more advanced approach).
3. **Training Loop:** Design a training loop where the agent plays against itself numerous times, updating its Q-values based on the rewards received.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a simple strategy (e.g., random moves, or a player) to assess its learning progress.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If time allows, implement basic visualization using Pygame to display the game board and the AI's moves during training and evaluation.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, exploration rate) can be challenging and may require experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and iterate.
- **Convergence:** Ensuring the RL agent converges to a reasonably good strategy within the limited timeframe might require careful algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.  Focus on a simple, fast-converging algorithm.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: Gain practical experience with Q-learning or a similar algorithm, including state representation, action selection, reward functions, and the learning process.
- AI Agent Development:  Learn to design and implement a simple AI agent capable of learning through experience and self-play.
