# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, self-calibrating robotic arm system using computer vision. The goal is to create a program that automatically determines the end-effector position and orientation based on visual input from a camera, without requiring manual calibration.  This is a simplified version focusing on a single degree of freedom to ensure completion within the timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a suitable robotic arm control library (e.g., PySerial for serial communication if needed).
* **Tools:** A robotic arm (even a small, single-axis servo), a webcam or camera, a known calibration object (e.g., a chessboard), and a computer with the necessary software installed.

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition and Processing:** Capture images from the webcam and preprocess them for feature detection.
- **Calibration Object Detection:** Detect and locate the calibration object (e.g., chessboard corners) in the image using OpenCV's feature detection algorithms.
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the pose (position and orientation) of the calibration object relative to the camera.
- **Arm Position Calculation:** Use the estimated pose to calculate the corresponding position of the robotic arm's end-effector.
- **Arm Movement (Optional):**  Control the robotic arm to move to the calculated position.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement error correction using iterative refinement of the pose estimation.
- **Advanced Feature:** Extend to multiple degrees of freedom (if time allows).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries and connect the robotic arm and camera.
2. **Image Processing & Calibration:** Capture images of the calibration object at known positions. Use OpenCV to detect and locate the object and calculate camera intrinsics and extrinsics.
3. **Pose Estimation:** Develop a function to estimate the pose of the calibration object in each image.
4. **Arm Position Calculation:** Develop a transformation to map the calibration object's pose to the robotic arm's end-effector position.
5. **(Optional) Arm Control:** Implement the code to move the robotic arm to the calculated position using the appropriate robotic arm control library.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Pose Estimation:**  The accuracy of the pose estimation depends on the quality of the images, the chosen algorithm, and the precision of the calibration object.  Using a high-quality camera and robust feature detection algorithms will improve accuracy.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Processing images and controlling the robotic arm in real-time requires efficient algorithms and code optimization.  Consider using multiprocessing or multithreading if necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of computer vision techniques, including image processing, feature detection, and pose estimation.
- Practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotics for automated calibration.
