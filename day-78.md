# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system that uses a camera feed to detect and track a specific object in real-time, and then commands a robotic arm to follow and potentially interact with that object. This is a simplified version of advanced robotic manipulation tasks, focusing on the core elements of perception and control within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental application of computer vision and robotics control.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), PySerial (serial communication with robotic arm), a suitable robotic arm control library (e.g., specific to your robotic arm model).
- **Hardware:**  A robotic arm (any model with serial communication capabilities), a USB camera, and a computer.

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:** Detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using OpenCV's object detection capabilities.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position continuously as it moves within the camera's field of view.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector (e.g., gripper) to the tracked object's coordinates.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Account for the camera's perspective and the robotic arm's coordinate system.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for cases such as object loss or out-of-reach positions.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Calibration:** Connect the camera and robotic arm to the computer. Calibrate the camera and establish communication with the robotic arm using PySerial and the appropriate library.
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement object detection using OpenCV's Haar cascades or a deep learning model (simpler models preferred for daily scope).  Implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter for better smoothness) to maintain the object's position even if it's briefly occluded.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Develop a function to convert the pixel coordinates from the camera feed into the robotic arm's coordinate system.  This might require a simple transformation or a more complex calibration process depending on the robotic arm and camera setup.
4. **Arm Control:**  Send commands to the robotic arm based on the tracked object's location in the robotic arm's coordinate system.  Implement basic safety checks to prevent collisions or out-of-bounds movements.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with the target object. Refine the detection and tracking parameters, and adjust the arm control logic to improve accuracy and robustness.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Coordinate System Transformation:**  Accurately mapping pixel coordinates to the robotic arm's coordinate system can be challenging and may require careful calibration.  A simplified approach for a daily project might involve a linear approximation.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Ensuring that the system runs smoothly in real-time and handles delays efficiently might require optimization of the code and potentially limiting the resolution of the camera feed.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of object detection, tracking, and image processing techniques using OpenCV.
- **Robotic Control Principles:** This project provides hands-on experience with robotic arm control, coordinate transformations, and the challenges of real-time feedback control.
