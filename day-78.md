# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL). The goal is to build a functional AI opponent that can learn and improve its strategy within a short timeframe. This provides a practical demonstration of RL principles and its application in game playing.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for RL implementation)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A game library or custom game engine (e.g., Pygame for visualization, or a simple text-based implementation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Trainable AI agent using a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
    - Ability to play against the AI agent.
    - Real-time game visualization (optional, but recommended).
    - Basic logging of agent performance (win/loss rate).
- **Advanced Features:**
    - Exploration-exploitation balance adjustment (e.g., epsilon-greedy strategy).
    - Persistence of the trained model (saving and loading weights).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Engine Setup:** Create a basic game engine (text-based or graphical) to handle game logic, player moves, and win/loss conditions.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning or SARSA) and implement it using PyTorch/TensorFlow. Define the state space, action space, and reward function for the game.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop to repeatedly play the game against itself, updating the agent's Q-values based on the chosen RL algorithm.
4. **Play and Evaluate:**  Test the trained agent against a human player.  Analyze win/loss rates and identify areas for improvement.
5. **Model Persistence (Optional):** Implement saving and loading of the trained model's weights to persist learning progress.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:** Finding the optimal balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions can be challenging and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters (like epsilon in epsilon-greedy).
- **Convergence Speed:**  Reinforcement learning can be computationally intensive, particularly for complex games.  Careful selection of hyperparameters and algorithm is crucial to ensure convergence within the timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning or SARSA).
- Understanding of concepts like state space, action space, reward functions, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
- Experience with building and evaluating AI agents in a game environment.
