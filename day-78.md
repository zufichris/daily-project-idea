# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for a simulated or real self-balancing robot.  The goal is to create a stable control system that keeps the robot upright, demonstrating a core concept in robotics control systems. This project is scalable â€“ a simulation can be completed within a day, while a physical implementation may take two days depending on the hardware available.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID control and simulation), Pygame (optional, for visualization)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino/Raspberry Pi, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), motors, and a suitable robot chassis.  Simulation can be used instead.


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balance:** The robot should maintain an upright position when disturbed slightly.
- **PID Tuning Interface:** Allow adjustment of P, I, and D gains to observe their effect on stability.
- **Sensor Integration (Simulation or Real):**  The system accurately reads angular position and velocity data either from a simulated environment or an IMU.
- **Motor Control:**  The controller sends appropriate signals to motors to counteract imbalance (simulated or real).
- **Stability Metrics:** Display some basic metrics like robot angle or motor power usage.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a Kalman filter for noise reduction in sensor readings.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporate a visual feedback system (e.g., using OpenCV if using a camera).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment and Libraries:** Install necessary libraries and set up a project structure.  If using a physical robot, connect and test the hardware (IMU and motors).
2. **Implement Basic Control Loop:**  Create a basic control loop that reads sensor data, applies a simple proportional control (to start), and sends commands to the motors.  This should include a simulation if physical hardware is unavailable.
3. **Implement PID Controller:** Integrate the PID algorithm into the control loop.  Start with initial guess PID gains.
4. **Tune PID Gains:** Systematically adjust the P, I, and D gains to find optimal settings for stable balance. This requires iterative testing and adjustment.
5. **(Optional) Add Advanced Features:** Integrate the Kalman filter or a visual feedback system if time permits.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and iterative.  Understanding the effect of each gain (P, I, D) is crucial.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world sensors introduce noise, which can affect stability.  Filtering techniques (like Kalman filter) can mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** Gain a deep understanding of PID controllers, their implementation, and tuning.
- **Robotics Control Systems:**  Develop practical experience with designing and implementing a basic robot control system.
