#  Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will interpret simple hand gestures to trigger predefined actions within a simulated smart home environment. This allows for hands-free control and exploration of efficient gesture-based interaction design.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), NumPy
* **Framework:**  None (script-based)
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurately track hand landmarks from the webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize predefined gestures (e.g., thumbs up for lights on, thumbs down for lights off, fist for pausing music).
- **Simulated Smart Home Control:**  Simulate actions based on recognized gestures (e.g., print commands to the console representing light changes, music control).
- **User Interface (UI):** A basic visualization displaying the recognized gesture and corresponding action.
- **Calibration:**  Allow for simple calibration to account for different hand sizes and lighting conditions.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., using a small dataset of gesture images) for improved gesture recognition accuracy.
- **Integration with a Real Smart Home System:** (challenging for a 1-2 day project) Integrate with a platform like Home Assistant to trigger actual smart home device actions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Hand Tracking:** Install necessary libraries. Set up the webcam feed and implement MediaPipe hand tracking to extract hand landmark coordinates.
2. **Gesture Definition and Recognition:** Define a set of simple gestures and write logic to recognize them based on the landmark coordinates (e.g., distances between specific landmarks).
3. **Smart Home Simulation:** Create a simple function to simulate smart home actions based on the recognized gestures.  Print these actions to the console for feedback.
4. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI (using OpenCV's drawing functions or a minimal GUI library) to display the webcam feed, tracked landmarks, recognized gestures, and simulated actions.
5. **Calibration (Optional):** Implement a basic calibration routine allowing the user to adjust thresholds for gesture recognition.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in hand size, lighting, and background clutter can affect accuracy.  Careful threshold setting and potentially more sophisticated gesture recognition algorithms may be needed.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing real-time processing requirements with accuracy might require optimization of the code.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Gain practical experience with real-time image processing and hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition Techniques:** Develop understanding of simple gesture recognition algorithms and their limitations.
