# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated robot navigating a dynamic obstacle-filled environment.  The goal is to create a system that efficiently finds the shortest or most efficient path, considering real-time changes in the environment.  This is significant for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and game AI.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NetworkX (optional, for graph representation), A* search algorithm implementation.

## Features & Requirements

- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot should avoid obstacles that appear and disappear in the environment.
- **Path Visualization:** The found path should be clearly displayed using Pygame.
- **Real-time Updates:** The path should recalculate in real-time as obstacles move or appear.
- **Efficiency Metric:** Implement a way to measure the path length or other efficiency metrics (e.g., number of turns).
- **Start/Goal Point Selection:** Allow the user to interactively set the starting and goal points for the robot.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a different pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's) for comparison.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a simple "cost" to different parts of the environment (e.g., higher cost for rough terrain) to influence path selection.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple Pygame window representing the environment.  Implement basic obstacle representation (e.g., squares or circles).
2. **A* Implementation:** Integrate a pre-existing or self-implemented A* search algorithm to find paths between the start and goal points, avoiding obstacles.
3. **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:**  Implement logic to detect and react to changing obstacles.  This might involve re-running the A* algorithm periodically or using a more sophisticated approach.
4. **Path Visualization:** Display the calculated path on the Pygame window, clearly indicating the robot's movement.
5. **Efficiency Measurement:** Add a counter or timer to track path length and calculation time for comparison.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:**  Finding the optimal path in a complex, changing environment can be computationally expensive.  Consider using heuristics and optimizations within the A* algorithm.
- **Obstacle Representation:** Choosing an efficient data structure to represent obstacles and the environment is crucial for performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of pathfinding algorithms:** This project provides hands-on experience implementing and optimizing A*, gaining a deeper understanding of its mechanics and limitations.
- **Real-time system design:**  Building a system that reacts to dynamic changes in the environment reinforces best practices for real-time programming and responsiveness.
