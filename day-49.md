# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified, yet intelligent, traffic light simulation using agent-based modeling.  The simulation will focus on optimizing traffic flow at a single intersection by dynamically adjusting traffic light timings based on the number of vehicles approaching from each direction. This project emphasizes efficient algorithm design and implementation within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `Pygame` (for visualization), `NumPy` (for numerical computation), potentially `SimPy` (for discrete-event simulation if time allows).

## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  Vehicles are randomly generated at each approach to the intersection, with configurable arrival rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** A basic traffic light system (red, yellow, green) dynamically adjusts its cycle length and phase timings based on vehicle queues.
- **Queue Management:**  The simulation maintains queues of vehicles waiting at each approach.
- **Visualization:**  `Pygame` provides a visual representation of the intersection, vehicle movement, and traffic light states.
- **Performance Metrics:**  The simulation collects data on average wait times, throughput, and overall traffic flow efficiency.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to further optimize traffic light timings.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Introduce different vehicle types (e.g., emergency vehicles) with priority signaling.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Structure:** Set up the `Pygame` window, create the intersection visualization, and implement basic vehicle generation and movement.
2. **Traffic Light Logic:** Implement a simple fixed-time traffic light controller.
3. **Queue Management:**  Add queue data structures to track vehicles waiting at each approach.
4. **Dynamic Control:**  Replace the fixed-time controller with a dynamic controller that adjusts timings based on queue lengths.
5. **Performance Measurement & Visualization:**  Collect and display performance metrics (average wait times, etc.).  Consider adding graphs.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Efficiency:** Designing an efficient algorithm for dynamic traffic light control within the time constraint is crucial. A simple heuristic approach might be more suitable than a complex algorithm for a one-day project.
- **Visualization Performance:**  `Pygame` performance can degrade with a large number of vehicles. Consider simplifying the vehicle representation or optimizing drawing routines if performance becomes an issue.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Agent-based Modeling:** This project reinforces understanding and practical application of agent-based modeling techniques.
- **Algorithm Design & Optimization:**  The need for efficient algorithms within a constrained resource environment (time and computational power) highlights best practices in algorithm design and optimization.
