# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.  The focus is on rapidly prototyping and observing the learning process within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating the practical application of reinforcement learning in a concise and understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for game development)
- A reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a Pong-like game or a simple maze navigation).
    - An AI opponent using a Q-learning or similar reinforcement learning algorithm.
    - Basic game mechanics (player input, score tracking, game over conditions).
    - Visualization of the game and AI's learning progress.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization).
    -  Saving and loading the trained AI model.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Design and implement the basic 2D game environment using Pygame. This includes creating game objects, handling player input, and defining game rules.  Keep it extremely simple.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent Implementation:** Integrate a chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning from Stable Baselines3). Define the state space, action space, and reward function for the AI agent.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop to repeatedly run the game, allowing the AI agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy.
4. **Visualization and Evaluation:** Implement visualization to show the game state and the AI's learning progress (e.g., plot the cumulative reward over time).
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time allows, experiment with different RL algorithms or hyperparameters to improve the AI's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully crafting the reward function is crucial for effective learning.  An improperly designed reward function can lead to unexpected or undesirable AI behavior.
- **Computational Cost:**  Training reinforcement learning agents can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the game environment and using a less computationally demanding algorithm will help manage this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like state, action, reward, and policy updates.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:** This project provides hands-on experience using a reinforcement learning library, translating theoretical knowledge into practical implementation.
