# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a tinyML-based gesture recognition system controlling a smart home device.  The system will leverage a microcontroller with onboard machine learning capabilities to process sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope) in real-time, minimizing latency and power consumption.  The significance lies in exploring the potential of edge computing for creating responsive and energy-efficient smart home solutions.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (or similar with onboard ML capabilities)
* **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE with TensorFlow Lite Micro libraries.
* **Sensor:**  Onboard accelerometer and gyroscope of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro.
* **Development Environment:** Arduino IDE.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Acquisition and Processing:** Capture accelerometer/gyroscope data and preprocess it (filtering, windowing).
- **Model Inference:**  Perform real-time gesture classification using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite Micro model (e.g., for simple gestures like "swipe up," "swipe down," "wave").
- **Actuator Control:**  Trigger a specific action on a smart home device (e.g., turn on/off a light, adjust volume) based on the classified gesture.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record sensor data and classification results for model training and analysis.
- **User Interface (Optional):** A simple serial monitor display showing the classified gesture.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Collect a dataset of accelerometer/gyroscope readings for each target gesture using the Arduino.  Implement basic signal processing techniques (e.g., smoothing, normalization).
2. **Model Training (if needed):** If a pre-trained model is unavailable, train a simple model (e.g., a k-Nearest Neighbors or a small convolutional neural network) using a suitable dataset and TensorFlow Lite Micro's converter.  This step may take longer than a day, so using a pre-trained model is crucial for a daily challenge.
3. **Model Deployment:** Integrate the trained (or pre-trained) TensorFlow Lite Micro model into the Arduino code.
4. **Actuator Integration:** Implement the code to control a smart home device (e.g., using a relay module to switch a light) based on the gesture classification results.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the model or preprocessing steps as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Size and Performance:**  Balancing model accuracy and computational resources on a resource-constrained microcontroller is a key challenge.  Careful selection of the model architecture and quantization techniques are crucial.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Ensuring sufficiently fast inference speed to enable real-time gesture recognition requires efficient code optimization and careful consideration of data handling.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of TinyML:** Gain hands-on experience in developing and deploying a machine learning model on a microcontroller.
- **Sensor data processing and real-time system design:**  Develop skills in handling sensor data, implementing signal processing algorithms, and building responsive real-time systems.
