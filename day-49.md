# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Robotic Arm Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for controlling a robotic arm using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The goal is to create a responsive and intuitive interface, minimizing the need for complex control devices. This has applications in assistive robotics, automation, and human-robot interaction research.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of gestures for precise control.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), PySerial (serial communication for robotic arm)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, Robotic Arm (e.g., Dobot Magician, uArm), Computer with sufficient processing power.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  Accurately detect predefined hand gestures (e.g., open hand, fist, pointing index finger) from webcam feed.
- **Robotic Arm Control Mapping:** Map detected gestures to specific robotic arm movements (e.g., open hand = grip, fist = release, pointing = move to a predefined location).
- **Calibration Interface:** Allow users to easily calibrate the gesture recognition model and map gestures to arm actions.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where gestures are not clearly detected.
- **Basic GUI:** A simple graphical user interface to display the detected gesture and control parameters.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Gesture sequencing for complex actions, machine learning model for improved accuracy and adaptability to various hand sizes.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, connect the webcam and robotic arm, and test their functionality.  Capture a small dataset of images for each target gesture.
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect hand landmarks. Train a simple classifier (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors) on the captured data to distinguish between the defined gestures.
3. **Control Mapping & Implementation:**  Develop the mapping between detected gestures and robotic arm commands (using PySerial or the arm's API).
4. **GUI Development:** Create a basic interface to display the recognized gesture and allow for calibration adjustments.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system extensively, adjusting parameters and model settings to optimize accuracy and responsiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of gesture recognition. Experiment with different image processing techniques (e.g., adaptive thresholding) to mitigate this.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Some gestures might be similar; robust classification techniques and careful selection of gestures are crucial.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of computer vision techniques for real-time applications.
- Practical experience with robotic arm control and interfacing.
- Understanding of the challenges in building human-computer/robot interfaces.
