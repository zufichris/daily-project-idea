# Self-Balancing Robot Control Algorithm Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing a control algorithm for a self-balancing robot (e.g., a Segway-like robot simulated in a physics engine).  The goal is to improve the robot's stability and responsiveness using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller, potentially exploring more advanced control techniques within the timeframe.  This allows for rapid iteration and experimentation with different control parameters and strategies.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Physics Engine:** PyBullet (for simulation; alternatively, a simplified 2D model can be used)
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for data visualization and analysis)
- **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  Implement a basic PID controller for balancing.
    -  Visualize the robot's angle, angular velocity, and control signals over time.
    -  Measure and record performance metrics such as settling time and overshoot.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implement a Kalman filter to improve sensor readings and robustness to noise.
    - Explore a more advanced control algorithm like LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Simulation:** Create a simplified robot model in PyBullet (or a 2D model) and define the necessary physics parameters (mass, inertia, etc.).
2. **Implement the PID Controller:** Design and implement a PID controller using NumPy to receive sensor readings (angle and angular velocity) and output motor commands.
3. **Tune the Controller:** Experiment with different PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to optimize the robot's performance, minimizing overshoot and settling time. Use Matplotlib to visualize the results and guide the tuning process.
4. **Performance Evaluation:**  Measure and record key performance metrics (settling time, overshoot, steady-state error) for different PID gain combinations.
5. **(Optional) Implement Advanced Features:** If time permits, integrate a Kalman filter or explore the LQR controller for improved performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments and careful observation of the robot's behavior.  Systematic tuning approaches (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method) can be helpful.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation directly affects the controller's performance.  Care must be taken to ensure the model realistically represents the robot's dynamics.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID Control:**  This project provides hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Understanding Control System Performance Metrics:**  The project highlights the importance of evaluating control system performance through quantitative metrics like settling time and overshoot, fostering a data-driven approach to system design.
