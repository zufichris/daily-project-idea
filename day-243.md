# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The focus is on building a functional AI prototype within a short timeframe, emphasizing a practical application of RL concepts. This allows for quick iteration and experimentation with different RL algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (for rapid prototyping)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -  An RL agent capable of learning through self-play.
    -  Basic training loop with reward system (win/loss/draw).
    -  Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., win rate over time).
    -  Ability to play against the trained AI agent.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Implementation of a different RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
    -  Exploration-exploitation strategy optimization (e.g., epsilon-greedy).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple game environment using Python and a library like Gym.  Define the game rules, state representation, and reward system.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic. This includes defining the action space, state space, and learning process.
3. **Training Loop:**  Implement a training loop where the agent plays against itself, updates its policy based on rewards, and stores training data.
4. **Visualization:** Plot metrics like win rate or average reward over training iterations to track progress.
5. **Play Against AI:**  Create a function to allow a human player to interact with the trained AI agent.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward system that guides the agent towards optimal play can be challenging. Experimentation might be needed to find the best reward structure.
- **Computational Resources:** Depending on the complexity of the game and the chosen RL algorithm, training might require considerable computational resources if the model becomes too complex.  Consider simplifying the model or limiting the training iterations if necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of Reinforcement Learning concepts (e.g., state, action, reward, policy).
- Practical experience in implementing and training an RL agent in a simple game environment.
- Hands-on experience with a popular RL framework (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
