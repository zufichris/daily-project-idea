# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimal 2D game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be custom-designed for simplicity, focusing on a single agent interacting with a limited environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and demonstrable learning within a short timeframe.  This demonstrates core RL concepts in a practical and immediately rewarding way.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar like RLlib)
* **Game Engine (optional):** Pygame (for visualization; can be omitted for core RL functionality)
* **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Environment:** A small grid-based environment with a single agent and a single reward location. The agent can move up, down, left, and right.
- **Reward System:**  Positive reward upon reaching the reward location, negative reward for each step taken.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  A simple agent using a Q-learning or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.
- **Training Loop:**  A training loop that iteratively trains the agent and tracks performance metrics (e.g., steps to reach goal).
- **Basic Data Visualization (Optional):**  A simple plot to visualize the agent's learning progress (e.g., average steps to reach the goal over time).

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Adding obstacles to the environment to increase complexity.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game environment using either a simple text-based representation or a minimal Pygame implementation.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning or PPO) and implement the agent using Stable Baselines3.
3. **Training Loop Implementation:**  Write a training loop that iterates through episodes, collects data, and updates the agent's policy.
4. **Testing and Evaluation:**  Evaluate the agent's performance by running several test episodes and measuring the average number of steps to reach the goal.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If using Pygame, visualize the agent's progress in the game environment.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require some experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust based on initial results.
- **Reward Shaping:**  Designing an effective reward system that encourages the desired behavior can be tricky.  Consider adding penalties for undesirable actions.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience with core RL concepts like rewards, states, actions, and policy learning.
- **Agent-Based Systems:**  Develop skills in designing and implementing simple agent-based systems that interact with an environment.
