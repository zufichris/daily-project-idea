# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning).  The focus is on rapid prototyping and iterative improvement, making it suitable for a daily or two-day challenge. The game's simplicity allows for quick implementation of the core RL logic, while leaving room for advanced features.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Game Mechanics:**  A simple 2D game (e.g., Pong, a simplified version of Snake) with clear win/lose conditions.
- **AI Opponent:** An AI player controlled by a Q-learning algorithm.  The AI should learn to play the game over time.
- **Reward System:** A well-defined reward system for the AI, encouraging optimal gameplay.
- **Basic Visualization:** The game should be visually appealing and provide clear feedback.
- **Training and Testing Phases:** Separate modes for training the AI and testing its performance against a human player.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy implementation for the AI.  Saving and loading trained Q-tables.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Create the basic game framework using Pygame, defining game mechanics, scoring, and win/lose conditions.  Focus on simplicity.
2. **Environment Definition:** Define the game environment as a state-action space for the Q-learning algorithm. This involves identifying the relevant game states and possible actions.
3. **Q-learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm using NumPy. This involves creating the Q-table, updating it based on rewards, and selecting actions using an exploration-exploitation strategy.
4. **AI Integration:** Integrate the Q-learning agent into the game, allowing it to play against itself during the training phase.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the AI's performance against a human player and iterate on the reward system or Q-learning parameters to improve its strategy.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the AI towards optimal play can be challenging.  Careful consideration of the game's dynamics is crucial.
- **Convergence Speed:**  Q-learning's convergence speed can be slow.  Experimenting with different learning rates and exploration parameters may be necessary to achieve reasonable performance within the timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:  Gain practical experience with Q-learning, understanding its core concepts and implementation.
- Game AI Development:  Learn how to integrate AI into a simple game, focusing on the interplay between the game environment and the learning algorithm.
