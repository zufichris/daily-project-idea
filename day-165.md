# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robotic Object Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a streamlined AI system for image captioning, specifically tailored to improve object recognition capabilities in a robotic environment.  The goal is to build a system that can take an image as input, generate a human-readable caption describing the objects present, and then use that caption to inform robotic actions (e.g., picking up a "red ball," placing a "blue box on the table"). This project will focus on a small, controlled environment.


## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- A pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub)
- A simple robotic simulator (e.g., V-REP, Gazebo - optional, if time permits)


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Input & Preprocessing:**  The system accepts an image (e.g., from a webcam or a pre-loaded dataset) and performs basic preprocessing steps like resizing and normalization.
- **Caption Generation:** A pre-trained model generates a caption describing the objects and their properties in the image.
- **Object Identification:** The caption is parsed to identify key objects and their attributes (color, size, location â€“ approximate).
- **Actionable Output:** The identified objects and their attributes are presented in a structured format suitable for robotic control (e.g., JSON).
- **Basic Error Handling:** The system gracefully handles cases where object recognition fails or the caption is ambiguous.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integration with a simple robotic simulator to demonstrate object manipulation based on the generated captions.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implementation of a simple feedback loop to refine object recognition based on robotic action outcomes.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Model Selection:**  Choose a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub), install necessary libraries, and set up the development environment.
2. **Image Input & Preprocessing:** Develop a module to handle image input, resizing, and normalization using OpenCV.
3. **Caption Generation & Parsing:** Integrate the chosen model and develop logic to parse the generated captions, extracting relevant information about objects.
4. **Output Formatting:** Structure the extracted object information (name, attributes) into a JSON or similar easily parsable format for robotic control.
5. **Testing & Evaluation:** Test the system with various images, assessing the accuracy of object recognition and caption generation.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Pre-trained Models:** Pre-trained models might not be perfectly accurate for all objects or scenarios; this may require some fine-tuning or adaptation.
- **Caption Ambiguity:** Generated captions can sometimes be ambiguous; robust parsing logic is needed to extract reliable information.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of deep learning models for image captioning and object recognition.
- Practical experience in integrating pre-trained models into a larger application.
