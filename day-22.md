# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimal game environment using reinforcement learning. The goal is to create a prototype demonstrating basic Q-learning within a constrained timeframe, showcasing the core concepts of reinforcement learning without extensive complexity.  The chosen game environment will be extremely simple, allowing for rapid iteration and progress.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Environment:** A simple grid-based game where the agent navigates to a goal while avoiding obstacles.  The environment will be coded from scratch or use a simplified version of an existing OpenAI Gym environment.
- **Q-learning Implementation:** The AI agent uses a Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for navigating the game.
- **Training and Visualization:** The agent's training progress will be visualized through plots showcasing the rewards and learning curve.
- **Reward System:** A clear reward system defined to incentivize the agent reaching the goal and penalize collisions with obstacles.
- **Basic Agent Actions:**  The agent will have limited actions (e.g., move up, down, left, right).


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation during training.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Experiment with different learning rates and discount factors to observe their impact on performance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**  Create or adapt a simple game environment (OpenAI Gym recommended). This involves defining the grid, goal location, obstacles, and agent's starting position.
2. **Q-table Initialization:**  Initialize the Q-table, a matrix representing the agent's estimated rewards for taking each action in each state.
3. **Q-learning Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning update rule within a training loop. This involves iteratively updating the Q-table based on the agent's experiences.
4. **Training and Data Collection:** Run the training loop for a predetermined number of episodes, collecting data on rewards and performance.
5. **Visualization:** Plot the learning curve (e.g., average reward per episode) to visualize the agent's learning progress.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal values for the learning rate and discount factor might require experimentation.  Start with common defaults and adjust as needed.
- **Environment Complexity:**  Balancing simplicity (to achieve a daily goal) with sufficient complexity to demonstrate learning can be tricky.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project provides hands-on experience with Q-learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Python Programming and Libraries:**  Reinforces proficiency in Python programming and using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical computation and data visualization.
