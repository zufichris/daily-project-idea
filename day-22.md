# Real-time Object Recognition and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time object recognition and tracking system using a webcam and a web browser, leveraging WebRTC for efficient data streaming and TensorFlow.js for on-device inference.  The goal is to create a prototype that can identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in real-time, showcasing the capabilities of client-side machine learning and WebRTC.  This has applications in augmented reality, robotics, and various interactive applications.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, potentially Python for initial model training (if using a pre-trained model, this step may be skipped).
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow.js, WebRTC, possibly a JavaScript UI framework like React or Vue.js for a nicer user interface.
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a web browser (Chrome recommended for WebRTC support), a code editor (VS Code recommended).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Capture and display the webcam feed in the browser.
- **Object Detection:**  Use TensorFlow.js to detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in the webcam feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across consecutive frames.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display bounding boxes or other visual cues around the tracked object.
- **FPS display:** Show frames per second to evaluate performance.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement object classification beyond simple detection (e.g., differentiate between red and blue balls).
- **Optional Feature:** Add a mechanism to calibrate the detection model's accuracy for specific lighting conditions or object variations.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the WebRTC stream:**  Establish a connection to the webcam and display the video stream using WebRTC in the browser.
2. **Load and initialize TensorFlow.js model:** Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD) or a simple custom model trained using TensorFlow/Keras and converted to a TensorFlow.js format.
3. **Implement object detection and tracking:** Run inference on each frame from the WebRTC stream using the loaded TensorFlow.js model.  Use the model's output to identify and track the target object's position.
4. **Visualize the results:** Overlay bounding boxes or other visual cues on the video stream to show the detected and tracked object.
5. **Display FPS:** Add a counter to display the frames per second processed to measure performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Performance Optimization:**  Real-time object detection and tracking can be computationally intensive.  Careful model selection and optimization techniques might be necessary to achieve a smooth experience.
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the object detection model will heavily influence the system's performance.  Using a pre-trained model might be faster than training a custom one within the one or two-day timeframe.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of WebRTC:** This project provides practical experience in using WebRTC for real-time video streaming.
- **Practical application of TensorFlow.js:**  Hands-on experience with client-side machine learning using TensorFlow.js for object detection and tracking.
