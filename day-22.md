# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a prototype for a micro-gesture recognition system using a readily available depth camera (like Intel RealSense or similar) to control smart home devices. The system will identify simple hand gestures (e.g., swipe up/down, wave, pinch) performed close to the camera, translating them into commands for controlling lights, music, or other IoT devices.  This allows for intuitive and contactless control, furthering the ease-of-use of smart home technologies.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), a suitable smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Hardware:**  Intel RealSense depth camera (or similar), a computer with sufficient processing power.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Accurate recognition of at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., swipe up/down, wave).
- **Command Mapping:**  Mapping recognized gestures to specific smart home device commands (e.g., swipe up = increase brightness, swipe down = decrease brightness).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Processing gestures and sending commands with minimal latency.
- **Device Control:** Integration with a smart home API to control at least one device type (e.g., lights).
- **Visual Feedback:** Optional visual feedback on the screen to indicate recognized gestures and command execution.

- **Advanced Features:**  Gesture customization (allowing users to define their gestures), multi-device control using different gestures.
- **Optional Feature:**  Incorporating voice commands as an alternative input method.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Calibration:** Install necessary libraries, connect the depth camera, and calibrate the camera to ensure accurate depth readings.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement gesture recognition using MediaPipe or a similar library, focusing on the chosen three gestures.  Train a model if necessary using a small dataset of gesture samples.
3. **Command Mapping & Execution:** Create a mapping between recognized gestures and smart home device commands. Integrate with the chosen smart home API to send control commands.
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with different lighting conditions and gesture variations.  Refine the gesture recognition model and parameters as needed to improve accuracy.
5. **Visual Feedback (Optional):** Implement visual feedback to display the recognized gesture and the executed command.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Depth cameras can be sensitive to lighting variations.  Appropriate image pre-processing or robust algorithms may be required to handle different lighting conditions effectively.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Distinguishing between similar gestures might require advanced techniques like temporal analysis or machine learning models.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision Concepts:** Practical experience with using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Hands-on Experience with Smart Home APIs:**  Developing skills in interacting with and controlling smart home devices programmatically.
