# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web browser and WebRTC. The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in a live video stream from a webcam and track its movement, displaying its position on the screen. This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and real-time communication technologies.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with TypeScript preferred)
- **Framework/Library:** TensorFlow.js or similar (for object detection), WebRTC API (for video streaming)
- **Tools:**  A web browser (Chrome recommended), a webcam, a text editor/IDE (VS Code recommended)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Streaming:** Capture video from the user's webcam using the WebRTC API.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) within the video stream using a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model or a lightweight custom model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across frames and display its bounding box or coordinates.
- **Display Results:** Overlay the detected object's bounding box and its coordinates on the video stream in real-time.
- **FPS Display:**  Display the frames-per-second (FPS) of the processing.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement object classification alongside detection (e.g., differentiating between red ball and red cube).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add server-side processing to handle multiple clients simultaneously or stream processed data to a remote location.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the WebRTC connection:** Establish a connection to the user's webcam using the WebRTC API and display the video stream in a canvas element.
2. **Load and initialize the object detection model:** Load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model or a lightweight custom model for object detection.
3. **Implement object detection and tracking:** Process each video frame using the loaded model, identify the target object, and track its position over time.
4. **Render results:** Draw the bounding box and coordinates of the detected object on the video stream.
5. **Display FPS:** Calculate and display the FPS to monitor performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance:** Processing video frames in real-time can be computationally intensive.  Consider using smaller, optimized models and techniques for performance optimization (e.g., reducing resolution).
- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models may not be perfectly accurate for specific objects.  Fine-tuning or training a custom model might be necessary for improved results.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of WebRTC:** Gain hands-on experience with implementing real-time video streaming using WebRTC.
- **Practical application of TensorFlow.js:** Learn how to use TensorFlow.js for real-time object detection and tracking within a browser environment.
