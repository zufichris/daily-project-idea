# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling smart home devices using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model.  The focus is on speed and simplicity, building a functional prototype that can control at least one device (e.g., a smart light) using a limited set of gestures. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision, machine learning, and smart home automation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (for pre-trained model), MediaPipe (optional, for faster gesture recognition), a suitable Smart Home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Hardware:** Webcam (or USB camera), a computer with sufficient processing power.
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open palm for ON, closed fist for OFF, thumb up for brightness increase).
- **Device Control:**  Integration with a smart home API to control a chosen device (e.g., turn a light ON/OFF, adjust brightness).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process the webcam feed in real-time to provide immediate feedback.
- **User Interface:**  A simple display to show the recognized gesture and device status.
- **Model Loading:** Load a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to minimize training time.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Device Control:** Extend control to multiple smart home devices.
- **Customizable Gestures:** Allow users to train custom gestures for specific actions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, MediaPipe (optional), relevant Smart Home API library).
2. **Gesture Recognition:**  Load a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model (or use MediaPipe for simplified implementation) and test its accuracy with sample images/video. Adapt and adjust threshold parameters for better performance.
3. **Smart Home Integration:**  Establish connection with chosen Smart Home API and test basic control commands for the target device.
4. **Real-time Processing:** Integrate the gesture recognition model with the webcam feed and implement logic to trigger smart home commands based on recognized gestures.
5. **User Interface:** Create a basic UI (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.putText` function) to display recognized gestures and device status.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand position, and occlusion might affect the accuracy. Using MediaPipe helps mitigate this but fine-tuning might be needed.
- **Latency:**  Balancing processing speed and accuracy to ensure real-time performance. Optimizing the code and utilizing hardware acceleration where possible is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of Computer Vision:** Applying pre-trained models and integrating them into a practical application.
- **Hands-on experience with Smart Home APIs:**  Learning to interact with and control smart devices programmatically.
