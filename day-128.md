# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent that can learn to play a basic game (e.g., a simplified version of Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) using reinforcement learning.  The focus is on a fast iteration cycle, prototyping a functional AI within a day or two using readily available libraries.  This demonstrates practical application of RL principles and allows for quick experimentation with different algorithms and hyperparameters.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A suitable game environment (can be custom-coded or utilize a pre-existing library if available)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A functioning game environment for a chosen simple game (e.g., 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe).
    - An AI agent that uses a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).
    - The AI agent should be able to learn through self-play and improve its win rate over time.
    - Basic training loop with clear metrics (e.g., win rate, average reward).
    - Ability to visualize the agent's learning progress (e.g., plot win rate over training episodes).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Incorporating an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
    - Implementing a simple neural network for function approximation in the reinforcement learning algorithm.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment:** Design and implement the chosen game's environment. This includes defining the game state, possible actions, and reward function.  For simplicity, use a minimal representation.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic. Initialize the Q-table or neural network.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that allows the agent to play multiple games against itself, updating its Q-values or neural network weights based on the received rewards.
4. **Visualization & Evaluation:** Plot the agent's performance metrics (e.g., win rate) over the training episodes to assess its learning progress.
5. **Refinement:**  Based on the results, adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, exploration rate) and potentially explore different RL algorithms.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Space:** Managing the state space can become complex for more sophisticated games.  For a one or two-day project, keep the game simple to manage this challenge.
- **Convergence:**  The AI might not achieve perfect play within the time constraint. Focus on demonstrating learning progress rather than optimal performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning).
- Experience with building and training AI agents in a simple game environment.  This project will reinforce the concepts of exploration vs. exploitation, reward functions, and the training loop in RL.
