# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a lightweight, real-time micro-gesture recognition algorithm. The system will utilize a readily available webcam or similar device to capture hand gestures, translating them into commands for controlling smart home devices (e.g., lights, thermostat).  The focus is on creating a functional prototype that emphasizes efficiency and speed of implementation within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), a suitable library for smart home device interaction (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Tools:** A laptop with a webcam, potentially a Raspberry Pi for a more embedded system approach.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Accurate tracking of hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognition of at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g.,  thumb-up for "increase brightness," thumb-down for "decrease brightness,"  a fist for "pause music").
- **Smart Home Integration:** Send commands to at least one simulated or actual smart home device based on recognized gestures.
- **User Interface:** A simple display (e.g., terminal output) indicating the recognized gesture and the action taken.
- **Calibration:**  Basic calibration options to adjust hand positioning sensitivity.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple User Support:**  Distinguish between different users based on hand features (size, shape).
- **Advanced Gesture Set:** Expanding the number of recognized gestures beyond the initial three.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Dependencies:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, smart home API library). Set up the webcam feed.
2. **Hand Tracking:** Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to extract hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement a simple gesture recognition algorithm based on the relative positions of the hand landmarks (e.g., using thresholds or distances).
4. **Smart Home Command Execution:**  Connect to a simulated or real smart home API and send commands based on the recognized gestures.
5. **UI Implementation:** Display the recognized gesture and the action taken on a terminal or simple GUI.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in hand size, lighting, and background noise can affect the accuracy of the gesture recognition.  Simplifying gestures and using robust algorithms can mitigate this.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Ensuring the system processes the camera feed and sends commands in real-time without significant delays requires optimized code and potentially hardware acceleration.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision Principles:** Practical experience with real-time image processing, hand landmark detection, and feature extraction.
- **Application of Machine Learning Concepts (implicitly):** While not explicitly building a complex ML model, this project employs a simplified form of classification (gesture recognition) â€“ highlighting the practical use of ML principles in a limited scope.
