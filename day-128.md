# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.  The game will be minimal in scope, focusing on demonstrating the core concepts of RL in a tangible way.  This allows for a quick prototype and observation of RL training within a short timeframe. The significance lies in understanding the practical application of RL in a simplified environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- Tools:  A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game (e.g., Pong, a simplified version of Snake).
    - An AI opponent controlled by a Q-learning agent.
    - Basic game logic (scoring, game over conditions).
    - Visualization of the game and AI's actions.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., SARSA).
    -  Adding a simple GUI for parameter tuning (learning rate, discount factor).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create the basic game framework using Pygame. Focus on simple graphics and core game mechanics.  This should be a very minimal version of the chosen game.
2. **State and Action Space Definition:** Define the game's state space (e.g., ball position, paddle position) and action space (e.g., move paddle up, down, or stay).
3. **Q-Learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm using TensorFlow/Keras or a simpler implementation for faster prototyping.  Focus on a streamlined approach, prioritizing functionality over optimization.
4. **Training and Testing:** Train the AI agent by letting it play against itself (self-play).  Observe the learning progress and fine-tune parameters if needed. Test the trained AI against a human player.
5. **Visualization and Refinement:** Add basic visualization to show the Q-values or the agent's actions. Refine the game logic and AI based on observations.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) for the Q-learning algorithm can be time-consuming.  Start with default values and adjust based on observation.
- **Game Complexity:** Balancing game complexity with the time constraint is crucial.  A too-complex game might hinder progress in a short time frame.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain hands-on experience with implementing and training a basic reinforcement learning agent.
- **Game AI Development:** Learn how to integrate an AI agent into a simple game environment, understanding the interplay between game mechanics and AI algorithms.
