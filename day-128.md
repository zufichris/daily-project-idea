# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The focus is on building a functional prototype demonstrating basic Q-learning within a day or two. The game itself will be minimalistic to allow for faster development and clearer demonstration of the AI's learning process.  The significance lies in practically applying a core concept in AI within a short time frame.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), NumPy (for numerical operations), and a reinforcement learning library like `gym` or a simplified custom implementation.

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple 2D Game Environment:** A basic game like "Catch" (catching falling objects) or a simplified version of Pong.
- **AI Opponent:** An AI agent using Q-learning to learn optimal actions.
- **Reward System:** A clear reward system defining the AI's goal (e.g., points for catching objects or winning rounds).
- **Training Visualization:** Basic visualization of the AI's learning progress (e.g., a plot showing the reward over time).
- **Game Playability:**  The game should be playable by a human player against the AI (optional).

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation in the AI's actions.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Introduce a simple enemy AI (non-learning) to add more complexity to the game environment.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Design and implement the basic game using Pygame.  Focus on a very minimalistic design.
2. **AI Agent Implementation:**  Create the Q-learning agent, defining the state space, action space, reward function, and Q-table.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement the training loop where the AI agent interacts with the game environment, updates its Q-table, and observes the rewards.
4. **Visualization:** Implement a simple visualization to track the AI's performance over time (e.g., a graph of cumulative reward).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the AI against a human player (optional) and adjust parameters like learning rate and discount factor as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **State Space Size:**  Managing the state space might become computationally expensive if the game becomes too complex. Simplify the game to keep the state space manageable for a quick prototype.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon value requires experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust based on the learning curve.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:**  Practical application of Q-learning, a fundamental algorithm in reinforcement learning.
- **Game Development:**  Gain experience in building a simple game using Pygame and integrating AI.
