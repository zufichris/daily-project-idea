# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a self-balancing robot simulated in a physics engine.  The goal is to create a stable, self-balancing robot that can recover from disturbances. This provides a practical application of control theory within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for visualization), Pymunk (2D physics engine), NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Simulate a two-wheeled self-balancing robot using Pymunk.
    - Implement a PID controller to maintain balance.
    - Visualize the robot's movement and sensor readings using Pygame.
    - Respond to external disturbances (e.g., simulated pushes).
    - Log key performance indicators (e.g., angle, angular velocity, motor power).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implement an auto-tuning algorithm for the PID gains.
    - Add a user interface for real-time parameter adjustment.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Create the robot model in Pymunk, defining its physical properties (mass, inertia, wheel radius).  Set up the Pygame window for visualization.
2. **Sensor Simulation:** Implement a simple sensor model to provide angle and angular velocity readings (these can be directly accessed from the Pymunk simulation).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Write the PID controller logic. This involves calculating the error, proportional, integral, and derivative terms, and then determining the motor power based on the PID output.
4. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the PID controller with the robot model and the Pygame visualization. Test the robot's stability under various conditions and tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) iteratively for optimal performance.
5. **Data Logging and Analysis:** Log relevant data (angle, angular velocity, motor power) to observe the robot's behavior and fine-tune the PID controller further.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging.  Start with conservative values and adjust iteratively.  Consider using a Ziegler-Nichols method for initial gain estimation.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the Pymunk simulation impacts the controller's performance.  Pay attention to the simulation parameters to ensure realistic behavior.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforced Concepts:** Understanding and implementing PID control algorithms, a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems.
- **Developed Skills:**  Practical experience with physics simulation, controller design, and iterative debugging within a time-constrained environment.
