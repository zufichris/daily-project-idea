# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a single, customisable micro-gesture.  The system will utilize a computer vision library to detect a pre-defined hand gesture from a webcam feed, triggering a specific smart home action (e.g., turning on/off a light, adjusting thermostat). This contrasts with existing systems often relying on voice or multi-step interfaces.  The focus will be on efficient implementation and accurate gesture recognition within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation, optional),  NumPy (numerical computation)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, (Optional: Raspberry Pi for deployment)
- **Tools:**  Jupyter Notebook (for rapid prototyping),  a pre-existing smart home API or simulation (e.g., Home Assistant API simulation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture & Processing:**  Capture webcam feed, pre-process image (resize, grayscale), and detect a defined hand gesture.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Implement a simple gesture recognition algorithm based on keypoint positions (e.g., using MediaPipe landmarks) or feature extraction.
- **Smart Home Action Triggering:** Translate recognized gestures into specific commands (e.g., "fist" = lights off, "thumbs up" = increase temperature).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display gesture detection status (e.g., bounding boxes) on the webcam feed.
- **Configuration:** Allow users to easily change the mapping between gestures and smart home actions.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporate machine learning (e.g., a small, trained model) for improved gesture recognition robustness.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a GUI for easier configuration.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Environment:** Install necessary libraries, test webcam functionality, and set up the smart home API simulation/connection.
2. **Gesture Definition & Capture:** Define a simple, easily distinguishable hand gesture and implement basic image processing (resizing, grayscale).  Capture and display the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Recognition Algorithm:** Implement a basic algorithm to detect the defined gesture using image processing techniques or MediaPipe's pose estimation.
4. **Smart Home Integration:** Connect the gesture recognition to the smart home API simulation.  Trigger pre-defined actions based on gesture detection.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly, refining the gesture recognition algorithm and handling edge cases.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  Ensuring accurate gesture detection despite variations in lighting, hand positioning, and background.  Addressing this might require more advanced image processing or machine learning techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and speed to maintain a responsive user experience.  This might necessitate optimization of the image processing pipeline and algorithm.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).**
- **Develop skills in real-time image processing and gesture recognition algorithm design.**
