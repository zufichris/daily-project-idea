# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera. The system will detect specific objects (e.g., a person, a car) within the camera's field of view, track their movement, and output the results either visually (on-screen) or through a data stream (e.g., coordinates, bounding boxes).  This is significant for applications such as security monitoring, automated surveillance, or robotic navigation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model with sufficient processing power), USB camera module.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for model inference, optional:  use a pre-trained model for faster prototyping), potentially a lightweight message broker like MQTT for data streaming.

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  Accurately detect and classify a pre-selected object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:** Continuously track the detected object's movement, providing real-time positional data (coordinates).
- **Visual Output:** Display bounding boxes around the detected object on the camera feed.
- **Data Output (Optional):** Publish object coordinates and bounding boxes via MQTT or a similar messaging system.
- **User-Configurable Detection Threshold:** Allow adjustment of the detection confidence level.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary software (Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite if using). Connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Model Selection/Loading:** Download a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or a similar source) optimized for mobile/embedded devices, or use a simpler approach with OpenCV's built-in features for detecting simple shapes/colors.
3. **Real-time Processing:** Write a Python script to capture video frames from the camera, run object detection on each frame, and track the object across frames using OpenCV's tracking functions (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`).
4. **Output:** Implement visual output (bounding boxes on the video feed) and optional data output (MQTT).
5. **Testing & Calibration:** Test the system's performance and adjust parameters (detection threshold, tracking algorithm) as needed to optimize accuracy and speed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Processing Power:**  Resource constraints on the Raspberry Pi might limit the frame rate, especially with complex models.  Choosing a lightweight model is crucial.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracker might lose track of the object if it's temporarily obscured. Implementing robust tracking algorithms to handle this is a challenge.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:**  Gain experience with efficient image processing techniques on resource-constrained hardware.
- **Object detection and tracking:**  Learn about various object detection algorithms and tracking techniques used in computer vision.
