# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Embedded System

## Overview
This project aims to create a small, portable system capable of real-time object detection and tracking using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module.  The system will identify a pre-defined object (e.g., a specific colored ball) and track its movement within the camera's field of view. This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and embedded systems for applications like robotics, surveillance, or automated processes.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar), Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2, power supply.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (or similar lightweight model), potentially a simple GUI framework (like Tkinter).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should detect the target object in real-time video feed from the camera.
- **Object Tracking:** Once detected, the system should track the object's movement across the video frames.
- **Position Reporting:** The system should output the object's x, y coordinates (relative to the camera frame) either to the console or a simple GUI display.
- **Performance Optimization:** The system should strive for a frame rate above 10 FPS to maintain real-time performance.
- **Alert Trigger (Optional):**  If the object leaves a predefined area, trigger an alert (e.g., a sound or a change in GUI display).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Set up the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite), and configure the camera. Download a pre-trained object detection model compatible with TensorFlow Lite.
2. **Object Detection Implementation:**  Integrate the TensorFlow Lite model with OpenCV to detect the target object in the camera feed.  This involves loading the model, processing frames, and extracting bounding boxes.
3. **Tracking Algorithm:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.track` functions or a custom implementation based on centroid calculation) to follow the detected object across frames.
4. **Position Reporting and Display:**  Output the object's coordinates to the console or create a basic GUI to visualize the tracked object and its position.
5. **(Optional) Alert Implementation:**  Add code to monitor the object's position and trigger an alert if it exceeds predefined boundaries.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Resource Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi has limited processing power.  Model selection and optimization are crucial for achieving real-time performance.  Consider using a smaller, quantized model for TensorFlow Lite.
- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Object detection models can be sensitive to lighting conditions and occlusion.  Dealing with potential inaccuracies and ensuring robust tracking will be a challenge.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of embedded systems programming:** This project enhances practical skills in working with hardware and software integration on a resource-constrained platform.
- **Gain experience with real-time computer vision:** This project builds hands-on experience in using OpenCV and deep learning models for real-time object detection and tracking.
