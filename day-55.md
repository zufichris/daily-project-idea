# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet effective, computer vision-based calibration system for a robotic arm.  The goal is to create a program that uses a camera to identify calibration markers placed at known locations in the robot's workspace and adjust the arm's internal coordinate system accordingly. This is crucial for ensuring accurate and precise movements of the robotic arm.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Framework:**  None (standalone script is sufficient)
- **Hardware:** Robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR3e, or simulated arm), Webcam or camera, Chessboard or Aruco markers.

## Features & Requirements
- **Marker Detection:**  Detect and locate calibration markers (chessboard or Aruco markers) in the camera's field of view using OpenCV.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Calculate the transformation matrix between the camera coordinate system and the robot's base coordinate system using the known marker positions.
- **Arm Calibration:** Apply the calculated transformation matrix to adjust the robot arm's internal model, correcting for any positional errors.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the detected markers and the calculated transformation on the screen.
- **Error Reporting:** Provide feedback on the accuracy of the calibration process and identify potential issues (e.g., markers not detected).

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a user interface for easier interaction and parameter adjustment.
- **Advanced Feature:** Incorporate iterative refinement techniques to improve calibration accuracy.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Marker Detection & Feature Extraction:** Use OpenCV to detect and extract corner points from a chessboard or Aruco markers in images captured by the camera.
2. **Camera Calibration:** Perform camera intrinsic parameter calibration if not already known (using a calibration routine provided by OpenCV).
3. **Coordinate Transformation Calculation:**  Utilize the known 3D marker coordinates and the detected 2D marker points to compute the transformation matrix (using functions like `cv2.solvePnP`).
4. **Robot Arm Control:** Send the calculated transformation matrix to the robotic arm's control system to update its coordinate system.  This step depends on the specific robotic arm's API and communication protocol.
5. **Verification:** Move the arm to several pre-defined points and verify the accuracy of the calibration.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Camera-Robot Synchronization:** Ensuring accurate synchronization between the camera's image capture and the robot's movements. A slight delay might introduce errors in calibration.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can affect the accuracy of marker detection.  Robust algorithms for marker detection under different lighting conditions might be needed.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of computer vision techniques for robotics.
- Understanding and implementation of coordinate transformation algorithms in robotics.
- Reinforcement of practical skills in image processing, robotic control, and calibration procedures.
