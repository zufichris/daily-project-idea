# Minimax AI for a Simplified Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simplified Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm. The simplification will involve a 3x3 board but with a win condition requiring only 2 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).  This reduces the search space for the Minimax algorithm, making it feasible to implement and test within a day or two.  The significance lies in understanding and implementing a fundamental AI algorithm used in many game-playing applications.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `pygame` (for GUI, optional but recommended), `random` (for initial moves)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A 3x3 game board displayed graphically (using `pygame` or a text-based representation).
    - A human player can make moves by clicking (or entering coordinates).
    - An AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
    - Win/loss/draw detection and game termination.
    - A simple score tracking system (optional).
- **Advanced Features:**
    - Difficulty levels (adjusting search depth in Minimax).
    - An option for the human player to go first or second.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board and Basic Logic:** Create the game board representation (either a 2D array or a graphical representation using `pygame`).  Implement functions to handle player moves, check for wins, and detect draws.
2. **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the Minimax algorithm recursively.  The simplified win condition makes the algorithm's search space significantly smaller, improving efficiency.
3. **AI Integration:** Integrate the Minimax function into the game loop.  The AI should make moves based on the Minimax algorithm's output.
4. **Game Loop and User Interface:** Create a game loop that alternates between human and AI turns.  Use `pygame` to create a visual interface or use print statements for a text-based interface.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the game against various strategies to identify and fix bugs.  Consider adding features like score tracking or difficulty levels if time permits.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Algorithm Optimization:**  While the simplified rules reduce complexity, optimizing the Minimax algorithm for speed (e.g., using alpha-beta pruning) can still be challenging within the time constraint. Prioritize a functional implementation first, then optimize if time allows.
- **GUI Implementation (if using pygame):**  If using `pygame`, efficient handling of the graphical display and user input can be time-consuming.  Start with a simple visual representation and add more advanced features later if time permits.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Algorithm Implementation:**  This project reinforces the understanding and practical application of the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental concept in AI game playing.
- **Game Development Practices:** This project offers hands-on experience in game loop design, user input handling, and integration of AI components into a complete game.
