# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimal game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be a text-based version of a classic, allowing for rapid iteration and experimentation. This provides a practical demonstration of RL concepts within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple, text-based game environment (e.g., a simplified version of tic-tac-toe or a maze navigation).
    - An AI agent using a Q-learning algorithm.
    - Training the AI agent through multiple game iterations.
    - Basic visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., a plot of reward over time).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., SARSA, Deep Q-Network).
    - Adding a more complex game environment.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the simple game environment using Gym or a custom class.  Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Develop the Q-learning agent, including functions for choosing actions (epsilon-greedy strategy), updating Q-values, and handling the game logic.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updates the agent's Q-values, and records performance metrics.
4. **Visualization:** Implement basic plotting to visualize the agent's learning curve (e.g., average reward per episode).
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance after training by letting it play several games against a random or optimal strategy.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Choosing an appropriate reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Careful consideration of the game's objective is crucial.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor, epsilon) might require experimentation and may not be fully achievable in a short time frame, requiring focusing on a specific range.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning concepts (Q-learning, state-action space, reward function).
- Practical experience with implementing and training an RL agent.
