# Smart Home Device Integration with Custom Voice Control

## Overview

This project aims to create a prototype for a smart home device that integrates with existing smart home ecosystems (e.g., Philips Hue, Google Home) but uses a custom voice recognition model trained on a small, specific vocabulary. The significance lies in demonstrating a streamlined approach to integrating bespoke voice control into pre-existing smart home setups without requiring extensive cloud-based services.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Speech Recognition Library:** SpeechRecognition (for initial prototype, potentially move to a more advanced library like Vosk for offline capabilities)
* **Smart Home API:**  Specific API for chosen ecosystem (e.g., Philips Hue API, Google Home API)
* **Machine Learning Library:**  Scikit-learn (for simple training, or consider a more advanced library like TensorFlow Lite for offline models)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller for a standalone implementation


## Features & Requirements

- **Custom Voice Command Recognition:**  The system should recognize a small set of custom voice commands (e.g., "turn on bedroom lights," "set living room temperature to 22").
- **Smart Home Device Control:** Successfully integrates with at least one smart home device category (lights, thermostat).
- **Simple User Interface:**  A basic text-based interface to display the recognized commands and system status.
- **Offline Functionality (Optional):**  The system should be able to function offline, requiring no internet connection.
- **Error Handling and Feedback:**  Provides clear feedback to the user if a command is not recognized or execution fails.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Record audio samples of the custom voice commands multiple times.
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple speech recognition model using the collected data with Scikit-learn.  (Advanced: Explore TensorFlow Lite for optimized mobile/embedded deployment).
3. **API Integration:** Connect to the chosen smart home API using the appropriate library.
4. **Command Execution:**  Develop a function that maps recognized commands to specific API calls for device control.
5. **User Interface Development:** Create a simple text-based interface to show the recognized command and the results of its execution.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of the Speech Recognition Model:** Achieving high accuracy with a small dataset can be challenging; experimenting with different models and data augmentation techniques might be necessary.
- **API Limitations:**  Different smart home APIs have different functionalities and access limitations.  Consider these constraints when defining the scope of the project.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Experience with Speech Recognition:**  This project provides hands-on experience with building and integrating a custom speech recognition system.
- **Smart Home API Integration:**  Develop proficiency in using and interacting with smart home device APIs, including authentication and data handling.
