# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with OpenCV and Python

## Overview
This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using OpenCV and Python.  The system will identify a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in a live video feed from a webcam and track its movement, displaying bounding boxes and potentially trajectory information. This project is significant because it demonstrates fundamental computer vision techniques applicable to various fields like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- A webcam (or pre-recorded video file)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time object detection:**  Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in a live video stream using color filtering or a pre-trained object detection model (like Haar cascades or a smaller YOLOv5 model).
- **Object tracking:** Track the detected object's movement frame-by-frame using a tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking or optical flow).
- **Bounding box display:**  Draw a bounding box around the detected object in the video stream.
- **FPS display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to evaluate performance.
- **Basic trajectory visualization (optional):**  Draw a trail or line representing the object's path.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`).
2. **Implement object detection:** Use color filtering or a pre-trained object detection model to identify the target object.  Focus on speed and simplicity for a daily challenge.
3. **Implement object tracking:**  Choose a suitable tracking algorithm and integrate it with the detection module.
4. **Display results:** Overlay bounding boxes and FPS on the video stream using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Optional: Add trajectory visualization:** Implement a simple trajectory display if time permits.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational cost:**  Real-time processing can be computationally demanding.  Consider using optimized algorithms and potentially reducing the video resolution for faster processing.
- **Object occlusion:**  The tracking algorithm might lose track of the object if it's temporarily occluded.  Exploring more robust tracking methods might be needed for a more advanced version.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce practical skills in using OpenCV for computer vision tasks, including video processing, object detection, and tracking.
- Gain experience in integrating different algorithms and libraries to build a complete system.
