# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game using reinforcement learning.  We'll build an agent that learns to play a simplified version of a game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, showcasing the core principles of reinforcement learning in a concise and readily demonstrable context. The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of AI techniques within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler approach).
    - Training of the agent against a random opponent.
    - Evaluation of the trained agent's performance against a random or fixed opponent.
    - Visualization of the training process (e.g., win rate over time).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    - Incorporating self-play for improved agent performance.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple game environment using Python.  This could be a text-based or a minimal graphical interface.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point) and implement the agent's logic for choosing actions based on the game state.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, allowing the agent to learn from its experiences.  Use a simple reward system (e.g., +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, 0 for a draw).
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a random or a fixed (e.g., always plays optimally) opponent.
5. **Visualization:** Visualize the agent's learning progress by plotting its win rate or other relevant metrics over time.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**  Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting already learned knowledge is crucial for efficient learning.  This may require tuning hyperparameters like the exploration rate.
- **Overfitting:**  With limited training time, overfitting to the specific training data is a possibility.  Careful monitoring of the agent's performance on unseen data (a separate test set) is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:** This project reinforces the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning, including state, action, reward, and the learning process.
- **Practical Application of AI:** This project showcases how AI techniques can be applied to solve a specific problem within a limited timeframe, emphasizing the iterative and experimental nature of AI development.
