# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and understanding the core concepts of RL, rather than creating a highly polished game. The significance lies in applying a powerful machine learning technique to a tangible, interactive system within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a maze navigation game or a simple pong clone).
    - An AI opponent controlled by a Q-learning algorithm.
    - Basic game mechanics (e.g., movement, scoring).
    - Real-time visualization of the game.
    - Ability to train the AI agent through multiple episodes.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).
    - Incorporating a user interface for controlling game parameters (learning rate, exploration rate).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Environment Setup:**  Create a basic game environment using Pygame, defining game rules, player controls (for the human player, if desired), and reward mechanisms.
2. **Q-learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm using NumPy and a simple state-action representation for the game.  Focus on a concise implementation.
3. **Agent Training:** Train the AI agent over multiple game episodes. Monitor performance metrics (e.g., average score) to assess learning progress.
4. **Game Integration:** Integrate the trained agent into the game environment, allowing it to play against a human player or a simple rule-based AI.
5. **Visualization:** Visualize the game, including the AI's actions and learning progress.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **State Representation:**  Finding an effective way to represent the game state as input to the RL algorithm can be challenging, especially for more complex games.  Start with a simple representation and iterate.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  The performance of the RL algorithm is sensitive to hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate). Experimentation might be needed to find a good balance.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience in implementing and applying Q-learning to a real-world problem.
- **Game Development Basics:**  Refine skills in game development using a framework like Pygame, covering game logic, rendering, and user interaction.
