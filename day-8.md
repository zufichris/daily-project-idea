# Mini-Game AI Agent using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Connect Four) using reinforcement learning techniques.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating fundamental RL concepts within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy
- A game environment library (e.g., a custom-built one or a simplified version of existing game libraries)

## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:** A functional game environment implementing the chosen game's rules and logic.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An agent that learns through trial and error using a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler variant).
- **Training Loop:**  A process for training the agent, involving repeated game play and updating the agent's policy based on rewards.
- **Evaluation Function:** A method to assess the agent's performance (e.g., win rate).
- **Visualization (Optional):**  A simple visual representation of the game state and agent's decisions.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Explore different reward functions to influence agent behavior.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the game environment. This includes defining the game state, actions, and reward system.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm and implement the agent's learning logic. Start with a simpler algorithm like Q-learning.
3. **Training Loop Development:** Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updates the agent's policy, and evaluates performance.
4. **Testing and Evaluation:**  Run the training loop and evaluate the agent's performance.  Observe learning progress and adjust parameters as needed.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Implement basic visualization to monitor the game and the agent's learning process.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Experimentation and iterative refinement may be needed.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions known to be good) is crucial for efficient learning.  This needs careful consideration in algorithm selection and parameter tuning.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning principles.
- Experience with designing and implementing a simple game AI agent.
- Hands-on practice with relevant Python libraries for machine learning and deep learning.
