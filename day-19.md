# Self-Calibrating Robotic Arm Gripper

## Overview

This project aims to develop a software module for a robotic arm that enables its gripper to self-calibrate its grip strength based on the object's perceived weight and material properties. This is crucial for handling a variety of objects without damage, showcasing robust adaptation in robotic manipulation.  The focus will be on a simulated environment for rapid prototyping.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Robotics Simulation:** PyBullet (or a similar physics engine)
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- **Optional:** A ROS (Robot Operating System) interface for potential future integration with real hardware.

## Features & Requirements

- **Weight Estimation:** The system should estimate the weight of an object using sensor data (simulated in this case).
- **Material Identification (basic):** A simple classification system (e.g., hard/soft) based on simulated sensor readings (force feedback).
- **Adaptive Gripping:** The gripper's grip strength adjusts dynamically based on estimated weight and material type.
- **Safety Mechanism:** Includes a safety mechanism to prevent excessive force application.
- **Data Logging:** Logs grip strength, estimated weight, and material classification for analysis.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a feedback loop to refine weight estimation based on initial grip attempts.
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate a vision system (simulated) for object recognition and further refinement of material properties.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the PyBullet simulation environment and define the robotic arm and gripper models.
2. **Weight & Material Estimation:** Implement algorithms to estimate object weight (using simulated force sensors) and a basic material classification based on simulated sensor data (e.g., deformation).
3. **Adaptive Control Logic:** Develop the core control logic to adjust the gripper's strength based on estimated weight and material properties, incorporating safety limits.
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various simulated objects, iteratively refining the algorithms and parameters based on the results.
5. **Data Visualization & Logging:**  Implement data logging and visualization to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:** Simulating realistic sensor noise and handling its effect on the estimation algorithms will be challenging.  Simple noise models can be added to test robustness.
- **Material Classification Accuracy:**  Achieving accurate material classification with limited sensor data will require careful algorithm design and parameter tuning.  Focusing on a binary classification (hard/soft) simplifies this.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of control algorithms:** This project reinforces the understanding and implementation of control systems, specifically adaptive control for robotic manipulation.
- **Experience with robotic simulation:**  Working with a physics engine like PyBullet provides practical experience in robotic simulation, crucial for prototyping and testing before hardware integration.
