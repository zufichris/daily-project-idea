# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up/down, wave) and translate them into commands to control smart home devices (simulated in this prototype). This is significant as it explores a more intuitive and accessible interface than traditional voice or app-based control.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, NumPy
- **Framework (Optional):** Flask (for a simple web interface)
- **Hardware:** Webcam (any standard webcam will suffice)
- **Software:** Python interpreter, necessary libraries (installable via pip)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time gesture detection:**  Accurately identify pre-defined hand gestures from a webcam feed.
- **Gesture-to-command mapping:** Translate recognized gestures into specific commands (e.g., thumbs up = "increase lighting," thumbs down = "decrease lighting").
- **Simulated smart home control:**  Implement a simple system to simulate the execution of these commands (e.g., printing to the console, changing a simulated value).
- **User interface (Optional):**  Display current gesture recognition and simulated device state.
- **Error handling:**  Gracefully handle situations where a gesture is not recognized.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, set up the webcam feed using OpenCV, and capture frames.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement MediaPipe's hand detection and tracking model to identify hand landmarks in each frame.  Develop logic to classify the landmarks into predefined gestures.
3. **Command Mapping & Simulation:** Create a dictionary to map gestures to commands and a simple function to simulate their execution on simulated devices (e.g., adjusting brightness values).
4. **(Optional) UI Development:**  Create a basic user interface (e.g., using Flask) to display the recognized gesture and simulated device state in real-time.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions.  Refine the gesture recognition logic for improved accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness to lighting and background variations:**  MediaPipe's performance can be affected by lighting changes and cluttered backgrounds.  Consider using techniques like background subtraction to mitigate this.
- **Gesture ambiguity:**  Similar gestures might lead to incorrect classification. Explore advanced classification techniques or more distinctive gestures to improve accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce skills in real-time image processing, using libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Gain practical experience in developing a gesture-based user interface and integrating it with simulated hardware.
