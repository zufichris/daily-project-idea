# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will identify and track specific objects within the camera's field of view, providing coordinates and classification information. This is a practical application of computer vision and robotics, useful for various applications including security monitoring, automated inventory management, and robotic navigation.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for model inference), RPi.GPIO (for optional hardware control)
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or 4 recommended), USB camera, potentially a small servo motor (optional).
- **Model:** A pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for object detection (e.g., MobileNet SSD).  Alternatively, a smaller, more specialized model can be chosen to save resources.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect and classify objects within the camera's frame at a minimum of 10 FPS.
- **Object Tracking:** Track identified objects across consecutive frames.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Overlay bounding boxes and class labels on the camera feed.
- **Coordinate Reporting:** Output the (x, y) coordinates of the tracked object's centroid.
- **Classification Reporting:** Display the classification label (e.g., "person," "car," "ball") of the tracked object.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a small servo motor to pan and tilt the camera to follow the tracked object.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a user-defined threshold for object size; ignore objects below a certain size.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Model Selection:** Set up the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries, and download a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite object detection model.  Choose a model appropriate for the desired object(s) and the Raspberry Pi's processing capabilities.
2. **Camera Integration and Object Detection:** Integrate the USB camera with OpenCV and implement real-time object detection using the chosen TensorFlow Lite model.
3. **Object Tracking Implementation:** Use OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`) to track identified objects across frames.
4. **Display and Output:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels on the camera feed, and output the coordinates and classification information to the console.
5. **Optional Servo Integration (If Applicable):** If using a servo motor, implement control logic to pan and tilt the camera based on the tracked object's position.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power may limit the frame rate and the complexity of the object detection model that can be used.  Consider using a smaller, more efficient model or optimizing the code for performance.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracking algorithm may struggle if the object is frequently occluded or leaves and re-enters the frame. Experiment with different tracking algorithms to find the most robust solution.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of real-time image processing:** This project provides hands-on experience with the challenges of processing images in real-time with limited computational resources.
- **Practical application of computer vision and deep learning:** Using pre-trained models and integrating them into a practical application strengthens the understanding of deep learning's role in computer vision.
