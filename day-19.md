# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home device control system using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will interpret specific gestures from a webcam feed to trigger pre-defined actions within a simulated smart home environment. This project focuses on the core gesture recognition and action mapping, providing a foundation for more complex smart home integration.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  a simple MQTT client library (e.g., paho-mqtt) for simulated device control.
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
* **Optional:**  A Raspberry Pi for potential deployment beyond simulation.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately identify predefined gestures (e.g., open palm for lights on, closed fist for lights off, thumbs up for increasing volume).
- **Action Mapping:**  Specific gestures should trigger corresponding actions within a simulated smart home environment (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).
- **User Interface:** A simple visual representation of the recognized gesture and the triggered action.
- **Error Handling:**  Gracefully handle situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.
- **Configuration:** Allow users to easily define new gestures and their associated actions.


- **Advanced Feature 1:** Integration with a real smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant) via MQTT.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Gesture sequence recognition for more complex commands (e.g., a specific sequence of gestures to trigger a scene).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, MQTT client).
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe and define a basic gesture recognition logic based on hand landmarks.
3. **Action Mapping:** Create a mapping between recognized gestures and simulated smart home actions (using simple print statements or simulated MQTT messages).
4. **User Interface:** Develop a basic UI (using a library like Tkinter or a simple terminal output) to visualize the gesture and triggered actions.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the gesture recognition logic to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Dealing with ambiguous or unclear gestures might require more sophisticated image processing techniques or a more robust gesture recognition algorithm.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing real-time processing with accuracy can be challenging; optimization may be needed for smoother operation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Gain hands-on experience with real-time image processing, hand tracking, and gesture recognition.
- **Software Development Best Practices:**  Practice implementing a project with clearly defined features, modular design, and robust error handling.
