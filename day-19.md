# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize predefined hand gestures and trigger corresponding actions within a simulated smart home environment.  This project focuses on a streamlined approach, prioritizing rapid prototyping over complex gesture recognition capabilities.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  a simple event-based library (e.g., `threading` or a lightweight message queue)
- **Tools:**  Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)

## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., "thumbs up" for lights on, "thumbs down" for lights off, "fist" for adjusting volume).
- **Simulated Smart Home Control:**  Simulate turning lights on/off and adjusting volume using simple print statements to the console.  This can be easily extended to control actual devices with appropriate APIs.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual feedback on the console indicating which gesture is detected.
- **Calibration:** Allow for simple calibration to account for lighting variations.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where a gesture is not recognized or the webcam feed is interrupted.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple machine learning model (e.g., using scikit-learn) to improve gesture recognition accuracy over time.
- **Advanced Feature:** Integrate with a pre-existing or mock smart home API (e.g., using RESTful requests) to control real devices.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe). Set up a basic project structure.
2. **Implement Hand Tracking:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities to extract hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Recognition Logic:** Define the criteria for recognizing the three chosen gestures based on hand landmark positions.  This could involve simple distance or angle calculations.
4. **Smart Home Simulation:** Implement the simple simulated smart home control (console output).
5. **Integration & Testing:** Combine hand tracking, gesture recognition, and smart home simulation. Thoroughly test with various gestures and lighting conditions.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  Lighting conditions and variations in hand size/position can significantly impact recognition accuracy.  Simple thresholding might suffice for this prototype, but more sophisticated methods may be needed for real-world applications.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing real-time processing with accuracy can be challenging. Optimizing code and potentially reducing the resolution of the webcam feed may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience with image processing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Develop skills in rapid prototyping:**  The emphasis on a short development time fosters efficient coding practices and problem-solving under constraints.
