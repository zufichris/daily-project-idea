# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated two-wheeled self-balancing robot.  The goal is to create a stable system that maintains an upright position despite external disturbances. This is a classic control systems problem that allows for rapid prototyping and iterative improvement through PID parameter adjustments.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- Optional:  A robotics simulation environment like V-REP or Gazebo (for more realistic physics)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -  **Robot Model:** A simplified two-wheeled robot model with equations of motion.
    - **PID Controller Implementation:** A PID controller to regulate the robot's angle and angular velocity.
    - **Sensor Simulation:** Simulated sensor readings (angle, angular velocity) for the robot.
    - **Actuator Simulation:** Simulated motor control to adjust wheel speeds.
    - **Visualization:** A simple graphical representation of the robot's state using Pygame.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  **Noise Injection:** Add simulated sensor noise to make the control problem more challenging.
    - **External Disturbances:** Introduce simulated external forces (e.g., wind gusts) to test robustness.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Robot Model & Simulation:** Create a simplified model of the robot's dynamics (equations of motion). Implement this model in Python, using NumPy for calculations.  If using a simulation environment, import the robot model and sensor data.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement the PID controller using Python.  Initialize PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) with initial guesses.
3. **Sensor Integration:** Integrate the simulated sensor readings into the controller.
4. **Control Loop:** Implement the control loop, feeding sensor data to the PID controller and applying the resulting output to the simulated actuators.
5. **Visualization:** Use Pygame to visualize the robot's behavior (angle, angular velocity) over time.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve stability and good performance can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Experimenting with different tuning methods (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method) might be needed.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation will impact the controller's performance in a real-world scenario.  Simplifying assumptions made in the model might need to be refined.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control:**  Reinforce understanding of PID controllers and their implementation.
- **System Modeling & Simulation:** Gain experience in modeling dynamic systems and creating simple simulations.
