# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, up/down, pinch) to control smart home devices like lights and appliances. This is significant as it offers a more intuitive and contactless interaction method compared to traditional voice or app-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional, for model training/optimization).
- **Hardware:** Webcam, (optional) Raspberry Pi for deployment.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  Accurately detect pre-defined hand gestures from a webcam feed.
- **Device Control Integration:**  Interface with a simulated or real smart home API (e.g., using MQTT or a REST API) to control lights and appliances.
- **Gesture Calibration:** Allow users to calibrate their gesture inputs for improved accuracy.
- **GUI (Optional):**  A simple graphical user interface to display recognized gestures and control settings.
- **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe's pose estimation module.  Focus on a small subset of gestures initially (e.g., left/right swipe).
3. **API Integration:** Create a basic interface to send commands to a simulated smart home API based on recognized gestures.  Use simple print statements as placeholders if a real API is unavailable.
4. **GUI Development (Optional):** Create a basic GUI (using Tkinter or PyQt) to visualize detected gestures and control parameters.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system, adjusting parameters and refining gesture detection as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in lighting, hand position, and background clutter.  Consider using image pre-processing techniques to mitigate this.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and real-time performance is crucial. Optimize code and potentially explore using hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU) for improved speed.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce practical experience with computer vision libraries:** Develop proficiency using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing.
- **Gain experience in interfacing software with hardware/external APIs:** Develop skills in communicating with external systems or simulated APIs, a vital aspect of modern software development.
