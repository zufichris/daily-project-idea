# Smart Home Device Integration via Voice Control (Single-Room Prototype)

## Overview
This project aims to create a rudimentary prototype for a smart home device control system using voice commands, focusing on a single room. This provides a practical application of speech recognition and IoT integration, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing within a limited timeframe. The significance lies in learning the fundamental components of building a larger, more complex system.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python (with libraries specified below)
- Speech Recognition: SpeechRecognition library (or similar)
- IoT Platform:  MQTT (Mosquitto broker recommended for local setup)
- Hardware (Optional):  A Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller (if aiming for a more physical prototype, otherwise simulation is acceptable).  Simulating devices will suffice for the dayâ€™s scope.
- Libraries: paho-mqtt (for MQTT), potentially a library for interacting with specific smart devices (e.g., controlling Philips Hue lights).

## Features & Requirements
- **Voice Command Recognition:**  The system should recognize basic voice commands such as "Turn on the lights," "Turn off the fan," "Set the temperature to 22 degrees."
- **MQTT Broker Integration:**  Voice commands should trigger messages published to an MQTT broker.
- **Simulated Device Control:**  Simulate the response of smart devices (e.g., lights, fan, thermostat) based on MQTT messages.  These simulations could simply print messages to the console indicating successful actions.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle unrecognized commands or communication errors.
- **Basic Configuration:** Allow for modification of device names and commands via a simple configuration file.

- **Advanced/Optional Feature 1:**  Implement a natural language processing (NLP) component using a library like spaCy or Rasa to handle more complex and nuanced voice commands.
- **Advanced/Optional Feature 2:** Connect to a real smart home device (like a Philips Hue bulb) instead of simulation.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the MQTT Broker:** Install and configure a local MQTT broker (Mosquitto is a good choice).
2. **Implement Voice Command Recognition:** Use the SpeechRecognition library to capture and process voice input.  Focus on basic keyword recognition initially.
3. **Create MQTT Publishers:**  Implement functions to publish messages to the MQTT broker based on recognized commands.  Map voice commands to MQTT topics and payload messages.
4. **Develop Simulated Device Control:** Create functions that simulate the behaviour of smart devices by responding to received messages from the broker.
5. **Integrate Components:** Combine the voice recognition, MQTT publishing, and simulated device control to create a functional prototype.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:** Speech recognition can be sensitive to background noise and accents.  Consider adding error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- **MQTT Message Handling and Reliability:** Ensure robust error handling within the MQTT communication to prevent unexpected behaviour.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of speech recognition libraries:** This project reinforces the use of speech-to-text APIs and handling their outputs.
- **Understanding of basic IoT communication principles:**  Working with the MQTT protocol provides valuable insight into message queuing and device-to-device communication.
