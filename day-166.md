# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a gesture-based smart home control system using a low-power microcontroller and a machine learning model trained for TinyML.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures captured by an onboard sensor (e.g., accelerometer) and trigger predefined actions within a simulated smart home environment.  This project explores the feasibility and performance limitations of on-device machine learning for resource-constrained applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:**  MicroPython (for microcontroller programming) and Python (for model training and data preprocessing).
* **Microcontroller:** ESP32 or similar microcontroller with sufficient RAM and built-in sensors (accelerometer).
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro (for model deployment on microcontroller).
* **Development Environment:** Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
* **Sensor:**  Onboard accelerometer of the microcontroller or external low-cost accelerometer.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  Acquire accelerometer data representing various gestures (e.g., wave, swipe up/down).
- **Model Training:** Train a simple classification model (e.g., k-NN, decision tree) using a labeled dataset of gesture data.
- **Model Deployment:** Convert and deploy the trained model to the microcontroller using TensorFlow Lite Micro.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  The microcontroller identifies the captured gesture in real-time.
- **Action Triggering:**  Based on the identified gesture, simulate a smart home action (e.g., turn on/off lights via simulated API calls).

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementation of a more sophisticated model (e.g., CNN) for better accuracy.
- **Optional Features:**  Adding a visual feedback mechanism (LED) indicating successful gesture recognition.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect accelerometer data for different gestures and preprocess it (filtering, normalization).
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple classification model in Python using TensorFlow/Scikit-learn.
3. **Model Conversion & Deployment:** Convert the trained model to a TensorFlow Lite Micro format compatible with the chosen microcontroller.  Deploy the model to the microcontroller's flash memory.
4. **Microcontroller Programming:** Write MicroPython code to acquire sensor data, run inference using the deployed model, and trigger simulated actions based on the prediction.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the model/parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:** Acquiring a sufficient amount of high-quality, labeled gesture data might require careful planning.  Consider using data augmentation techniques to improve the model's robustness.
- **Model Optimization:** Balancing model accuracy and computational requirements for the resource-constrained microcontroller is crucial.  Experimenting with model architectures and quantization techniques is vital.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with TinyML:** This project reinforces the concepts and workflow involved in deploying machine learning models on low-power microcontrollers.
- **Sensor integration and data processing:** Gain hands-on experience in integrating sensors, collecting data, and preprocessing it for machine learning applications.
