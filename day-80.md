# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, self-balancing robotic arm using a microcontroller and a PID control algorithm. The goal is to create a system that can maintain a stable upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating a core concept in robotics control systems.  This will be a simulated project focusing on the algorithm development and testing.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy (for PID control implementation and simulations), Matplotlib (for visualization).
- Simulator:  Pygame (or a similar 2D game library for visualization)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Simulate a single-degree-of-freedom robotic arm.
    - Implement a PID controller to maintain the arm's upright position (angle of 0 degrees).
    - Simulate external disturbances (e.g., simulated wind gusts) affecting the arm's position.
    - Display the arm's angle and controller output visually in real-time.
    - Log data (time, angle, controller output) for analysis.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implement a more sophisticated disturbance model (e.g., random noise, sinusoidal forces).
    - Add a simple user interface for adjusting PID gains and disturbance parameters.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Model Setup:** Define a simplified dynamic model for the robotic arm (e.g., using a simple pendulum equation).  Initialize variables for angle, angular velocity, and desired angle.
2. **PID Implementation:** Implement the PID controller algorithm in Python using the SciPy library. Tune the Kp, Ki, and Kd gains experimentally.
3. **Simulation Loop:** Create a main simulation loop using Pygame (or similar) to update the arm's angle based on the controller output and the disturbance model.  Render the arm's position visually.
4. **Disturbance Simulation:** Introduce a simulated disturbance to the system (e.g., adding a random value to the angular acceleration at random intervals).
5. **Data Logging and Visualization:** Log the arm's angle, angular velocity, controller output, and disturbance over time.  Use Matplotlib to create graphs illustrating the system's response.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains to achieve stable and responsive control can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.
- **Simulation Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the simulation depends on the accuracy of the arm's dynamic model.  Simplifications in the model can affect the controller's performance.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of PID control algorithm implementation and tuning.
- Practical experience in building a simple dynamic system simulation.  Understanding the interplay between a system model, a controller and its parameters, and external disturbances.
