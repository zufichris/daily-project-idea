# Smart Home Device Integration with a Custom API

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified, custom API to control multiple smart home devices from a single interface.  This avoids reliance on proprietary APIs and allows for experimentation with device control strategies and automation without the complexities of integrating with numerous platforms. The focus will be on a minimal viable product (MVP) demonstrating the core concept.


## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python (with Flask or FastAPI for the API)
- Database: SQLite (for simplicity; could be swapped for PostgreSQL or MongoDB for scalability)
- Device Control:  HTTP requests (assuming devices have accessible web APIs; consider using specific libraries if working with a particular device ecosystem, e.g., Home Assistant API)
- Testing Framework:  pytest or unittest (optional, but recommended)


## Features & Requirements

- **Device Registration:**  The API should allow users to register smart home devices (e.g., smart lights, smart plugs) by providing a unique ID and their control URLs.
- **Device Control:**  Users should be able to send commands (ON/OFF, brightness level, etc.) to registered devices through the API.
- **Status Monitoring:** The API should retrieve and display the current status (ON/OFF, power consumption, etc.) of registered devices.
- **Error Handling:**  The API should gracefully handle errors (e.g., network issues, invalid commands, device unavailability).
- **Basic Authentication:** Implement basic HTTP authentication to protect the API.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Scheduled automation (e.g., turning lights on/off at specific times),  device grouping for simultaneous control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **API Setup:** Create a basic Flask/FastAPI application with routing for device registration, control, and status retrieval. Implement basic authentication.
2. **Database Design:**  Design a simple SQLite database schema to store device information (ID, control URL, type, etc.).
3. **Device Integration:**  Write functions to send HTTP requests to control and query the status of registered devices.  Thoroughly test these functions.
4. **API Endpoint Implementation:** Connect the database and device control functions to the API endpoints.
5. **Testing:**  Use a testing framework to verify the functionality of the API and the device integration.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Device API Compatibility:**  Different smart home devices have different APIs and control mechanisms. This project assumes a degree of uniformity (HTTP-based control), which might not always be the case.  Robust error handling is crucial.
- **Security:** Securely handling API keys and authentication is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to devices.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforces understanding of RESTful API design and implementation.
- Improves skills in database integration (CRUD operations) and handling external HTTP requests.
