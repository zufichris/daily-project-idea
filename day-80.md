# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves developing a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it. The game will be designed for quick prototyping and the RL agent will be trained using a lightweight RL algorithm like Q-learning, focusing on achieving a demonstrable level of competence within a short timeframe. This project aims to showcase the power of RL in a compact, accessible setting.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (game development), NumPy (numerical computation), a RL library (e.g., OpenAI Gym or a simplified custom implementation).

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a grid-based maze navigation or a simple pong clone).
    - A basic RL agent using Q-learning or a similar algorithm.
    - Training of the RL agent to achieve a specific goal (e.g., reach the exit in the maze, win the pong game).
    - Visualization of the game and the agent's learning progress.
    - Basic reward system within the game.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., SARSA).
    - Incorporate a simple GUI for parameter tuning.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Design and Development:** Create a minimal 2D game environment using Pygame. Focus on simplicity and ease of interaction for the RL agent.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Implement the chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning).  Define the state space, action space, reward function, and learning parameters.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that repeatedly interacts with the environment, updates the Q-table, and tracks performance metrics.
4. **Visualization:** Integrate visualization to display the game and the agent's progress (e.g., plotting reward over time).
5. **Testing and Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance by running it in the game environment. Observe its behavior and analyze the results.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Creating an effective reward function that guides the agent towards desired behavior can be challenging. Experimentation and iteration are crucial.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal learning rate, discount factor, and exploration-exploitation parameters requires experimentation.  A simple grid search might suffice for a day-long challenge.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning fundamentals: Understand the core concepts of Q-learning, state-action spaces, reward functions, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
- Game AI development: Gain experience in designing and implementing game AI using a reinforcement learning approach.
