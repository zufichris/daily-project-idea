# Mini-Game AI Agent using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Nim) using reinforcement learning (RL).  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and understanding the core concepts of RL, rather than creating a highly sophisticated agent.  The significance lies in gaining practical experience with RL algorithms and their application in game playing.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL algorithm implementation)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe is recommended for simplicity).
    -  An RL agent using a simple algorithm like Q-learning or SARSA.
    -  Training the agent against a random opponent.
    -  Basic performance evaluation (win rate, average game length).
    -  Visualization of the learning process (e.g., plotting reward over time).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).
    -  Training the agent against another RL agent (self-play).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple game environment using Gym or a custom implementation. Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement the chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning or SARSA) using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch. Define the agent's learning parameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate).
3. **Training:** Train the agent by letting it play multiple games against a random opponent. Monitor its performance and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance by letting it play against the random opponent or another instance of itself.
5. **Visualization:** Plot the agent's learning curve (reward over time) to visualize the training progress.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor) can be challenging and may require experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and adjust based on the agent's performance.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A well-designed reward function is crucial for effective learning.  Consider various reward schemes and their impact on the agent's behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning or SARSA).
- Understand the core components of a RL system (environment, agent, reward function).
- Develop skills in hyperparameter tuning and experimental evaluation of RL agents.
