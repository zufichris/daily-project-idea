# Intelligent Home Lighting Control with Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home lighting system controlled by hand gestures.  The system will utilize a computer vision model to detect specific gestures (e.g., hand wave for on/off, hand raise for brightness increase, hand lower for brightness decrease) from a webcam feed and translate them into commands to control connected LED lights. This project highlights the integration of computer vision with IoT control, a rapidly growing area in smart home technology.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi GPIO control, or similar library for other platforms)
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (or similar microcontroller), Webcam, LED light strip or compatible lighting system,  power supply.
* **Optional:** Cloud platform (e.g., AWS IoT Core, Google Cloud IoT) for remote control capabilities.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Detect and interpret three distinct hand gestures: wave (on/off), raise (brightness up), lower (brightness down).
- **Lighting Control:**  Control the on/off state and brightness level of connected LED lights based on recognized gestures.
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Calibration:** Allow for simple calibration of gesture recognition to account for variations in lighting and hand size.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement multiple user profiles with customizable gesture mappings.
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a voice assistant (e.g., Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa) for additional control methods.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, RPi.GPIO), connect the webcam and LED lights to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Implement gesture recognition:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect and classify hand gestures from the webcam feed.  Focus on the three core gestures (wave, raise, lower).
3. **Control the lights:**  Write code to interface with the LED lights using RPi.GPIO (or equivalent) based on the recognized gestures. Implement brightness control using PWM.
4. **Calibration and testing:** Implement a basic calibration routine to adjust the gesture recognition thresholds. Test and refine the system's accuracy and responsiveness.
5. **Optional: Cloud integration:**  If time permits, integrate the system with a cloud platform for remote monitoring and control.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting conditions:**  Variations in ambient lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Consider implementing techniques to compensate for these variations (e.g., image preprocessing).
- **Real-time performance:**  Processing the webcam feed in real-time requires efficient code and potentially optimization techniques to minimize latency.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces practical skills in computer vision, particularly gesture recognition and real-time image processing.
- It provides hands-on experience in integrating hardware and software components, creating a functional IoT application.
