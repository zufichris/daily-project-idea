# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with Webcam

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a webcam feed. The system will detect predefined objects (e.g., a specific color, shape, or a known object using a pre-trained model) and track their movement within the camera's field of view. This is a valuable skill for various applications, from robotics and surveillance to interactive art installations.  The focus will be on building a functional prototype within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Optional:** TensorFlow/PyTorch (for pre-trained model integration)
- **Hardware:** Webcam

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time object detection:** Detect a specified object (e.g., a red ball) in the webcam feed.
- **Object tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Bounding box visualization:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object in the video feed.
- **FPS display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.
- **Data output (optional):** Log the object's coordinates (x, y) and bounding box dimensions over time.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more robust tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter).
- **Advanced Features:** Integrate a pre-trained object detection model (YOLOv5, SSD, etc.) for more sophisticated object recognition.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) and connect the webcam.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a basic color-based object detection algorithm (or load a pre-trained model).  This might involve thresholding, contour detection, and shape analysis.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV's `cv2.Tracker` or a custom approach based on frame-to-frame difference analysis).
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and FPS data on the video feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and object movements. Adjust parameters (thresholds, tracking algorithm settings) to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting conditions:**  Changes in lighting can significantly affect object detection accuracy.  Robustness to varying lighting will require careful consideration of the image processing techniques used.
- **Occlusion:** Handling situations where the target object is partially or fully occluded requires a more advanced tracking algorithm. A simple solution might involve predicting the next location based on the previous trajectory.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Image processing fundamentals:**  Reinforce skills in color space manipulation, thresholding, contour detection, and basic image filtering.
- **Real-time video processing:** Gain experience with processing video streams efficiently and displaying results in real-time.  Understand the trade-offs between accuracy and performance.
