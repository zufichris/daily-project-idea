# Mini-Game AI for Existing Game Engine

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging AI opponent for an existing, readily available game engine like Pygame.  The goal is to create a functional AI that can play a basic game (e.g., tic-tac-toe, a simplified version of checkers, or a custom-designed simple game) against a human player within a day or two.  The emphasis is on a clean, well-structured codebase and a demonstrably functional AI, not on sophisticated graphics or extensive game mechanics.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Game Engine:** Pygame (or a similar lightweight engine readily available with sufficient tutorials)
- **AI Algorithm:** Minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning for optimization, if time allows)
- **IDE:**  VS Code, PyCharm, or similar.


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Functionality:** A playable game (e.g., tic-tac-toe) with clear win/lose/draw conditions.
- **Human Player Input:**  Ability for a human player to interact with the game via keyboard or mouse input.
- **AI Opponent:**  An AI player using the Minimax algorithm to make moves.
- **Game Visualization:**  Basic graphical representation of the game state on the screen.
- **Scorekeeping:**  Track wins, losses, and draws for both the human and AI players.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of alpha-beta pruning for Minimax to improve performance.  Adding a simple difficulty setting that adjusts the AI's search depth.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Set up the game environment using Pygame.  Design the game board and basic game logic (move validation, win condition checks).
2. **Human Input:** Implement human player input handling.
3. **Minimax AI:** Implement the Minimax algorithm to control the AI opponent's moves.  Start with a basic implementation, then consider alpha-beta pruning.
4. **Game Loop & Visualization:** Integrate the human and AI players into a main game loop that updates the game state and displays it visually.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the game thoroughly, ensuring the AI functions correctly and the game is playable.  Refine game mechanics or AI as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **AI Performance:**  The Minimax algorithm's performance can degrade with increasing game complexity and search depth.  Alpha-beta pruning is crucial for mitigating this.
- **Game Design:**  Balancing game complexity with the time constraint.  A simpler game will allow for a more robust AI implementation within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of AI algorithm implementation:**  This project allows for a practical understanding of the Minimax algorithm and its application in game playing.
- **Game development best practices:** This project will reinforce best practices in game development, including modular design, clean code, and efficient use of game engine functionalities.
