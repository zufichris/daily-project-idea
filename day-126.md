# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The goal is to develop a functional AI that can learn optimal strategies within a short timeframe, demonstrating core RL concepts.  This is significant as it provides a hands-on approach to understanding a complex field in a limited time.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - A reinforcement learning agent (using Q-learning or a simpler algorithm).
    - Training functionality allowing the agent to learn through self-play.
    - Evaluation functionality to assess the agent's performance against a random opponent or a pre-defined strategy.
    - Basic visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., win rate over time).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the learning process.
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Environment:** Create a game environment using OpenAI Gym (or code one from scratch if desired) for the chosen game. This involves defining the state space, action space, reward function, and game rules.
2. **Implement the RL Agent:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).  Implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on its current Q-values (or policy).
3. **Train the Agent:** Run the training loop, allowing the agent to play many games against itself.  Track the agent's performance metrics.
4. **Evaluate the Agent:** Test the trained agent against a random opponent or a simple rule-based strategy to assess its learned capabilities.
5. **Visualize Results:** Create a simple plot showing the agent's learning curve (e.g., win rate over training episodes).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Choosing the Right RL Algorithm:**  Balancing simplicity for a short timeframe with the potential for effective learning is crucial.  Q-learning is a good starting point but may not converge optimally within a day or two.
- **Environment Design:**  A well-defined game environment with appropriate rewards is key for effective RL. The reward function needs to incentivize winning strategies.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of fundamental Reinforcement Learning concepts like Q-learning or policy gradients.
- Practical experience in implementing and training an RL agent.  This includes defining state/action spaces, rewards, and training loops.
