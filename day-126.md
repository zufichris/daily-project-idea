# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview
This project aims to build a real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within a live video feed from a webcam. This demonstrates core computer vision concepts and can be extended for various applications like robotics or autonomous systems.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  Webcam or pre-recorded video file.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Capture:** Acquire video frames from a webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Identify a specific object (e.g., color, shape) within each frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the identified object's movement across consecutive frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object on the video feed.
- **FPS Display:** Show the frames per second (FPS) to evaluate performance.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement object classification using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5, MobileNet) for more robust object recognition.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Save the tracked object's trajectory data to a file for later analysis.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`).  Test webcam access.
2. **Video Capture and Preprocessing:** Write code to capture frames from the webcam. Implement any necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., color space conversion, blurring).
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:**  Use OpenCV's functions (e.g., `cv2.inRange`, `cv2.findContours`,  `cv2.trackbar`) to detect and track the target object based on chosen criteria (color, shape etc.).
4. **Bounding Box and FPS Display:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object. Calculate and display FPS.
5. **(Optional) Advanced Features:** Integrate a pre-trained model for classification or save the trajectory data.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness:**  Dealing with lighting variations, occlusions, and object shape changes can be challenging.  Consider implementing more sophisticated tracking algorithms if basic methods fail.
- **Performance:** Balancing real-time performance with accuracy might require optimization. Experiment with different algorithms and parameters to find a good trade-off.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of image processing and computer vision fundamentals using OpenCV.
- Practical experience in real-time object detection and tracking.  Gaining familiarity with different tracking algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses.
