# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating fundamental RL concepts within a constrained timeframe. The game will be text-based for simplicity, allowing for quick iteration and focusing on the core AI implementation.  The significance lies in understanding the practical application of RL and experiencing the iterative development process of an AI agent.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  Pygame (optional, for a simple visual representation), NumPy, a reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3, RLlib).

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple text-based game (e.g., a grid-based navigation game with rewards and penalties).
    - An RL agent capable of learning through trial and error.
    - Basic training loop to allow the agent to learn and improve.
    - A mechanism to evaluate the agent's performance (e.g., average reward).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Visualization of the agent's learning process (using Matplotlib or similar).
    - Different RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, DQN) for comparison.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Design & Implementation:** Define the game rules, reward structure, and state representation. Implement the core game logic in Python.  Keep it extremely simple (e.g., a 5x5 grid).
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (start with a simpler one like Q-learning) and implement the agent's logic to interact with the game environment.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop to allow the agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy.  Set a reasonable number of training iterations for a single day’s work.
4. **Evaluation:** Implement a function to evaluate the agent's performance after training.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If time permits, add visualization to track the agent’s learning curve (reward over time).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards desirable behavior can be challenging and requires careful consideration. Experimentation might be necessary.
- **Computational Resources:** Depending on the chosen RL algorithm and game complexity, training might take some time.  Prioritize simplicity to ensure completion within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts.
- Experience with designing a simple game environment and integrating an AI agent.
- Understanding the iterative process of RL training and the importance of reward shaping.
