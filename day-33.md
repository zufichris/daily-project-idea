# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice and Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using a combination of voice commands and hand gestures.  The focus will be on a simplified, functional prototype rather than a fully polished product.  This allows for rapid prototyping and exploration of multi-modal input interaction.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  PyAudio (audio input), OpenCV (computer vision for gesture recognition), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi GPIO control, if using physical appliance).
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi (or other microcontroller),  a small servo motor (for testing a physical control mechanism), a smart lamp or fan with API access.
* **Software:**  A simple web server (e.g., Flask) for potential future expansion.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to voice commands such as "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Set lamp brightness to 50%".
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., open hand for on, closed fist for off) using a webcam.  Gesture recognition should be limited to a small, defined set for feasibility.
- **Appliance Control:** The system should interface with a simulated appliance or a real smart appliance via its API.  A simple on/off switch will suffice for a quick prototype.
- **Error Handling:**  Basic error handling for voice recognition failure and invalid commands.
- **Feedback Mechanism:**  Provide visual or auditory feedback to confirm the command execution.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a home automation platform (e.g., Home Assistant).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  More sophisticated gesture recognition (multiple gestures, different actions).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure hardware (if using). Create a basic project structure.
2. **Voice Recognition:** Implement voice recognition using SpeechRecognition, handling potential errors and parsing commands.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement basic gesture recognition using OpenCV. Focus on a small set of clearly distinguishable gestures.
4. **Appliance Control:** Integrate with a simulated appliance (e.g., a simple on/off switch represented by a variable) or a real smart appliance via its API.  Use a function to send control commands.
5. **Combine and Test:** Integrate voice and gesture control, ensuring smooth execution and appropriate feedback.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Lighting conditions and camera quality can significantly impact the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Consider using a simple background and well-lit environment.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing the responsiveness of voice and gesture recognition with the need for efficient processing might require optimization. Prioritize a simple solution to meet the daily timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of integrating multiple input modalities (voice and gesture) into a single system.
- Practical experience with real-time processing and handling potential errors in sensor data (audio and video).
