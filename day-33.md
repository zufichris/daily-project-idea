# Mini-Max Search Algorithm Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to create a visual representation of the Minimax search algorithm, a fundamental concept in game theory and artificial intelligence, applied to a simplified game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.  The visualization will allow users to step through the algorithm's decision-making process, observing how it evaluates game states and chooses optimal moves. This helps understand a core AI concept in a tangible way.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (optional for efficient board representation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Board Display:**  Visual representation of the game board (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
- **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:**  A functional implementation of the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimization.
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Ability to step through the algorithm's evaluation of each node in the game tree.
- **Highlighting of Best Moves:**  Clearly visualizes the path chosen by the Minimax algorithm.
- **Game State Display:**  Show the current game state (e.g., whose turn it is, evaluation score of the state).

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Allow user input to play against the AI.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Visualize the entire game tree (might be limited by depth for larger games).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Game Board and Display:** Create a Pygame window and draw the game board.  Implement basic functionality to handle player inputs (if adding user interaction).
2. **Implement Minimax Algorithm:**  Write the core Minimax algorithm, including the evaluation function for game states.  Incorporate alpha-beta pruning for performance improvement.
3. **Integrate Visualization:** Update the game board display after each step of the Minimax algorithm, highlighting the currently evaluated state and chosen moves.
4. **Add Step-by-Step Control:** Implement buttons or keyboard controls to step through the algorithm's execution.
5. **Display Game State Information:** Show relevant information like the current player, evaluation scores, and depth of search.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Visualization and Performance:**  For larger games, visualizing the entire game tree can be computationally expensive.  Strategies like limiting the search depth or visualizing only a portion of the tree might be necessary.
- **Clear and Intuitive Visualization:**  Designing a clear and intuitive visual representation of the algorithm's workings is crucial for effective learning.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of Minimax Search:**  This project provides hands-on experience implementing and visualizing a crucial AI algorithm.
- **Improve Debugging and Visualization Skills:**  Developing the visualization requires careful debugging and attention to detail in presenting complex information in a clear and concise manner.
