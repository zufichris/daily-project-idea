# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and readily available machine learning libraries.  The significance lies in its potential applications in various areas, from security monitoring to robotic navigation, while being achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model with sufficient processing power), USB camera.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite or a similar lightweight ML model for object detection (e.g., MobileNet SSD).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video from the connected camera.
- **Object Detection:** Detect and classify objects within the video stream using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected objects across frames using OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., CSRT, KCF).
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Display bounding boxes around detected objects with class labels overlaid on the video stream.
- **Basic Data Logging (Optional):** Log the object type and location (coordinates) for further analysis.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi and install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python tensorflow`) and the chosen pre-trained model.
2. **Video Capture and Object Detection:** Write Python code to capture video frames, pass them to the object detection model, and obtain bounding boxes and class labels.
3. **Object Tracking:** Integrate OpenCV's tracking algorithms to maintain object identities across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels onto the video stream and display it using OpenCV's window functions.
5. **(Optional) Data Logging:** Write code to store object information to a file (e.g., CSV) for later analysis or visualization.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Limitations:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the frame rate and the complexity of the object detection model that can be used.  Consider using a smaller, optimized model.
- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models might not be perfectly accurate for all object types or scenarios.  Fine-tuning or using a custom-trained model (outside the daily challenge scope) could improve accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of object detection and tracking algorithms.**
- **Gain practical experience using OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite for embedded vision applications.**
