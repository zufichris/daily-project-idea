# Mini-Game AI for Retro-Style Arcade Game

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic arcade-style game like Pong or Breakout. The goal is to create an AI that exhibits surprisingly competent gameplay, leveraging basic machine learning techniques within a limited timeframe.  This project demonstrates practical application of reinforcement learning principles in a constrained environment.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development and display), NumPy (for numerical computation), a lightweight machine learning library like `sklearn` (for optional advanced features).

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic AI Opponent:** The AI should be able to track the ball and move its paddle to intercept it, demonstrating rudimentary reaction capabilities.
- **Game Loop Implementation:** A functional game loop including ball physics, paddle movement, score tracking and game-over conditions.
- **Scorekeeping and Visualization:** Display the score and provide visual feedback on the game state.
- **Adjustable Difficulty:**  Allow for adjusting the AI's response time and responsiveness.
- **Basic Collision Detection:** Accurate collision detection between the ball and paddles and walls.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Implement a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to enable the AI to learn and improve its performance over time during gameplay.
- **User Interface:** Create a basic GUI using Pygame to display game settings and scores.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Framework Setup:** Create the basic game window, paddles, and ball using Pygame. Implement the core game loop and basic physics.
2. **Basic AI Implementation:**  Implement a simple AI that moves the paddle to the predicted Y-coordinate of the ball's next position based on its current trajectory.
3. **Collision Detection:** Implement robust collision detection to handle ball-paddle and ball-wall interactions.
4. **Scorekeeping and Display:** Integrate score tracking and display elements.
5. **Difficulty Adjustment:**  Introduce a difficulty setting to adjust the AI's reaction speed. (Optional: implement RL training for an adaptive difficulty)

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Ball Trajectory Prediction:**  Accurately predicting the ball's trajectory can be challenging, especially with angles and bounces.  Simplification of the physics model might be necessary.
- **Balancing AI Difficulty:** Finding the right balance between a challenging yet playable AI difficulty might require some experimentation and iterative adjustments.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement in Practice:** This project provides a practical introduction to the concepts of reinforcement learning and its application in game AI.
- **Game Development Fundamentals:**  It reinforces fundamental game development concepts, such as game loops, collision detection, and user interface design within a simple game context.
