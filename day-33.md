# TinyML-Powered Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a gesture-based smart home control system using a microcontroller with TinyML capabilities. The system will recognize a limited set of hand gestures captured by a low-resolution camera module, triggering pre-defined smart home actions. This project emphasizes efficient resource utilization and demonstrates practical applications of TinyML.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Microcontroller:** ESP32-CAM (combines ESP32 processor with camera)
- **Programming Language:** MicroPython
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
- **IDE:** Thonny or PlatformIO
- **Camera:** Integrated camera module on ESP32-CAM


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  The system will recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., wave, thumbs up, clenched fist).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Gesture recognition should occur with minimal latency.
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Recognized gestures will trigger pre-defined actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume).
- **Model Training:**  A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained using a small dataset of gesture images.
- **Low Power Consumption:** The system should prioritize efficient power usage to extend battery life (if using batteries).

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implement a user interface on a small display to show recognized gestures.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Add gesture customization allowing users to train new gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Model Training:** Capture a small dataset of images for each gesture using the ESP32-CAM.  Train a simple CNN model using TensorFlow Lite Micro's tools, quantizing the model for optimal performance on the ESP32.
2. **Model Deployment:** Convert the trained model into a format compatible with TensorFlow Lite Micro and deploy it to the ESP32-CAM.
3. **Gesture Capture & Processing:**  Write MicroPython code to capture images from the camera, preprocess them (resizing, grayscale conversion), and feed them to the deployed model for inference.
4. **Action Triggering:**  Integrate with a smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant using MQTT) or simulate actions using LEDs or other onboard components.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system with various lighting conditions and user variations. Iterate on the model and code to improve accuracy and robustness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Limited Computational Resources:**  The ESP32 has limited processing power and memory.  Model optimization and quantization are crucial.
- **Data Acquisition:** Gathering a diverse and representative dataset for accurate gesture recognition may require careful planning.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Implementation:**  Gain practical experience in deploying and using machine learning models on resource-constrained microcontrollers.
- **Embedded System Programming:**  Enhance skills in MicroPython programming for embedded systems, focusing on real-time processing and efficient resource management.
