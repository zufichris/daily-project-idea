# Self-Balancing Robot Control Algorithm Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing a control algorithm for a self-balancing robot (e.g., a Segway-style robot simulated in a physics engine). The goal is to improve the robot's stability and responsiveness while minimizing oscillations using a specific control technique (e.g., PID control with modifications). This is significant as efficient control algorithms are crucial for robust and reliable robotic applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization, optional), NumPy (for numerical computation), SciPy (for optimization algorithms, optional)
* **Physics Engine (optional):** PyBullet or a similar physics engine for realistic simulation.  If not using a physics engine, simplified kinematic modelling will be used.


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balancing:** Implement a stable self-balancing algorithm using a chosen control technique (e.g., PID). The robot should maintain its upright position when undisturbed.
- **Response to Disturbances:** The robot should recover its balance after being subjected to simulated external forces (pushes).
- **Data Logging:**  Record sensor data (angle, angular velocity) and control outputs to analyze the algorithm's performance.
- **Performance Metrics:**  Implement measures to quantify performance (e.g., settling time, overshoot, oscillation amplitude).
- **Visualization (Optional):** Display the robot's movement and sensor data in real-time.


- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement an adaptive control mechanism to adjust the control parameters based on the robot's current state.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Compare the performance of the chosen control method (e.g., PID) with another control algorithm (e.g., LQR).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Setup:** Create a simplified model of the self-balancing robot (e.g., using a pendulum model). Define state variables (angle, angular velocity), inputs (motor torque), and equations of motion.  If using a physics engine, define the robot's physical properties.
2. **Control Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the chosen control algorithm (e.g., PID controller).  Tune the control parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) using trial and error or a more systematic approach.
3. **Simulation and Testing:** Simulate the robot's behavior under various conditions (e.g., initial disturbances). Analyze performance metrics (settling time, overshoot, etc.).
4. **Optimization (Optional):** If using SciPy, apply optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent) to find the optimal control parameters.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Implement a visual representation of the simulation using Pygame or similar.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Parameter Tuning:** Finding optimal control parameters can be challenging and might require iterative adjustments. Using optimization algorithms can ease this.
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the robot model directly affects the effectiveness of the control algorithm.  Simplified models are easier to implement but less accurate.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of control theory:** This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and tuning control algorithms.
- **Gain experience in robotics simulation:**  Working with a physics engine (optional) or simplified kinematic modelling provides practical skills in robotic system modelling and simulation.
