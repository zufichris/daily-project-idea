# Mini-Game AI:  Pac-Man Ghost AI Enhancement

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the AI of the classic Pac-Man ghosts using a simple, yet effective, reinforcement learning approach.  The goal is to create a more challenging and intelligent ghost AI within a limited timeframe, focusing on a single ghost for simplicity. This allows for rapid prototyping and testing of different reinforcement learning algorithms.


## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game rendering and interaction), NumPy (for numerical operations), a simple Reinforcement Learning library like `rllib` (optional, can be implemented from scratch for a greater challenge).


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Ghost AI:** Implement a basic ghost AI that chases Pac-Man using a simple pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*).
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:**  Implement a simple reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning) to learn optimal movement strategies.
- **Reward System:** Define a reward function that incentivizes the ghost to effectively chase and capture Pac-Man.
- **Training Loop:** Design and implement a training loop to iteratively improve the ghost's AI through interaction with a simulated Pac-Man environment.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Implement metrics to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the enhanced AI (e.g., success rate in capturing Pac-Man).

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Incorporate a simple form of exploration vs. exploitation to improve learning efficiency.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement multiple ghost AI agents using a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Create a basic Pac-Man game using Pygame, including a single ghost with basic movement.
2. **Implement a simple ghost AI:** Implement a naive chasing algorithm (e.g., following Pac-Man directly).
3. **Design the reward function:** Define a reward system to guide the reinforcement learning process. (e.g., +1 for getting closer to Pac-Man, -1 for moving away, +10 for catching Pac-Man).
4. **Implement the reinforcement learning agent:** Choose a simple algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement it to train the ghost's movement policy.
5. **Train and evaluate:** Run the training loop and evaluate the performance of the improved ghost AI against the basic AI.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward function design:** Crafting an effective reward function that balances exploration and exploitation can be challenging. Experimentation and iteration are key.
- **Computational cost:** Reinforcement learning can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the environment and algorithm will help manage this constraint within the daily timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience implementing and applying a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Understanding of reward function design and its impact on agent behavior.
- Improved understanding of AI agent training and evaluation.
