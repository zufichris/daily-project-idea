# Mini-Project: Smart Home Energy Consumption Dashboard

## Overview

This project aims to build a basic dashboard visualizing real-time energy consumption data from a simulated smart home environment.  The focus is on data acquisition, processing, and visualization, providing a practical example of data-driven decision-making in smart home applications.  The simulation aspect allows for rapid prototyping and iterative development within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: `matplotlib` (or `plotly` for interactive charts), `random` (for data simulation), `time` (for data updates), `flask` (for a simple web server - optional for advanced feature)

## Features & Requirements

- **Data Simulation:**  Generate random energy consumption data for various appliances (lights, AC, fridge, etc.) to simulate real-world usage.
- **Real-time Data Display:**  Visualize the simulated data using line graphs showing individual appliance consumption and total household consumption over time.
- **Data Aggregation:** Calculate and display total energy consumption for a specified period (e.g., hourly, daily).
- **Threshold Alerts (Optional):** Implement a simple alert system if total consumption exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Basic UI (Advanced):** If time allows, create a simple web interface using Flask to access the dashboard remotely.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Simulation Engine:** Write a Python script to generate random energy consumption data for each appliance. Use `random.uniform()` to simulate realistic variations in energy usage.  Update data at regular intervals (e.g., every second).
2. **Data Visualization:** Use `matplotlib` (or `plotly`) to create line graphs dynamically plotting the simulated data. Update the graphs in real-time using the data generated in step 1.
3. **Data Aggregation and Display:** Add code to calculate the total energy consumption and display it alongside individual appliance consumption.
4. **Threshold Alert (Optional):** Implement a conditional statement to trigger an alert (e.g., print a message to the console) if the total consumption exceeds a predefined limit.
5. **Web Interface (Advanced):** If time permits, integrate Flask to serve the dashboard as a simple web application, allowing for remote access.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Rate and Visualization Performance:**  Balancing the update frequency of the simulated data with the responsiveness of the visualization might require optimization depending on the data volume and chosen visualization library.
- **Data Realism:**  While random data provides a starting point, simulating more realistic usage patterns (e.g., higher energy consumption during peak hours) would enhance the projectâ€™s practical relevance but increases complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of data visualization techniques using Python libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly`.
- Practical experience in building real-time data dashboards, including data acquisition, processing, and display.  This project also helps solidify fundamental Python programming concepts.
