# Smart Home Energy Optimization Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic prototype for a smart home energy optimization system that learns user energy consumption patterns and suggests adjustments for improved efficiency. The prototype will focus on simulated data to avoid the complexities of real-world sensor integration within the short timeframe.  This will demonstrate the core logic and algorithms without external hardware dependencies.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning (regression models), Matplotlib for visualization.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Data Simulation:** Generate synthetic household energy consumption data (e.g., electricity usage per hour for various appliances).
- **Pattern Recognition:**  Employ a regression model (e.g., linear regression or a more advanced model like Random Forest) to identify consumption patterns based on time of day, day of week, etc.
- **Optimization Suggestions:**  Based on learned patterns, provide basic suggestions for energy savings (e.g., "Reduce appliance usage between 6 PM and 8 PM").
- **Visualization:**  Present the learned patterns and optimization suggestions using simple charts and graphs.
- **Data Persistence:** Store the simulated data and model parameters using a simple database (e.g., SQLite).

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a basic anomaly detection system to flag unusual energy consumption spikes.
- **Advanced Feature:** Incorporate external weather data (simulated or fetched from an API) to improve prediction accuracy.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Generation:** Create a Python script to generate realistic simulated energy consumption data for a week.  Include various appliances with different usage patterns.
2. **Model Training:**  Use Scikit-learn to train a regression model on the simulated data, predicting energy consumption based on time and day.
3. **Optimization Logic:** Develop the logic to analyze the model's predictions and generate energy-saving suggestions.
4. **Visualization:** Create visualizations (charts, graphs) to display the learned patterns and suggested optimizations.
5. **Data Storage:** Implement basic data persistence using SQLite to store the generated data and trained model parameters.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:** Simulated data might not perfectly reflect real-world complexities.  Focus on creating realistic patterns, even if some nuance is lost.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the appropriate regression model for this task requires some understanding of machine learning algorithms.  Start with a simple linear regression and consider more complex models if time permits.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python and relevant libraries.
- Gain practical experience in applying machine learning algorithms (regression) to a real-world problem.
