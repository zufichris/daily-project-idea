# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Embedded System

## Overview

This project aims to create a small-scale, real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a USB camera. The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within its field of view, displaying the object's location and potentially its trajectory on a connected monitor. This project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision and embedded systems, showcasing efficient resource management and real-time processing capabilities.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar), USB camera, monitor
* **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite (or a similar lightweight model), potentially a simple GUI framework like Tkinter.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system should accurately detect the target object (pre-defined) in real-time video feed from the USB camera.
- **Object Tracking:**  The system should track the detected object's movement across frames, providing continuous location data.
- **Visual Feedback:** The system should display a bounding box around the detected object on the monitor's video feed.
- **Coordinate Output:** The system should output the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center in real-time (e.g., to the console or a file).
- **Performance Monitoring:** Basic performance metrics (e.g., frames per second) should be displayed or logged.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Trajectory prediction (simple linear extrapolation), object classification (beyond simple detection).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) on the Raspberry Pi.  Test the camera connection and functionality.
2. **Object Detection Model:** Choose a pre-trained lightweight object detection model compatible with TensorFlow Lite (or adapt a suitable model). Optimize the model for speed and resource efficiency on the Pi.
3. **Real-time Processing:** Integrate the object detection model into a Python script using OpenCV. Process the camera's video feed frame-by-frame, performing detection and tracking.
4. **Visual Display and Output:**  Overlay the detection bounding box on the video feed using OpenCV's drawing functions.  Implement coordinate output.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Monitor and record frames per second (FPS) to evaluate the system's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:** The Raspberry Pi has limited processing power.  Model selection and optimization are crucial for achieving real-time performance.  Consider using model quantization to reduce model size and improve inference speed.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can affect object detection accuracy.  Robustness to varying light conditions might require additional image processing techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Gain practical experience in developing and deploying applications on embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi.
- **Real-time Computer Vision:**  Develop skills in implementing real-time object detection and tracking algorithms using OpenCV and lightweight deep learning models.
