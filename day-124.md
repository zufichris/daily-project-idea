# Self-Balancing Robot PID Control Tuning

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a self-balancing two-wheeled robot.  The goal is to create a stable and responsive system capable of maintaining balance without falling over, even with small disturbances.  This provides a practical application of a fundamental control systems concept.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy,  Pygame (for visualization – optional), RPi.GPIO (if using a Raspberry Pi), a suitable robotics library (e.g., Robot Operating System (ROS) – if using more complex hardware).
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A two-wheeled robot platform with appropriate sensors (e.g., MPU6050 IMU for tilt and angular velocity), motors, and a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi). Simulation can be used if hardware is unavailable.

## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Maintenance:**  The robot should remain upright when placed on a flat surface.
- **Self-Correction:** The robot should automatically correct its position after being slightly pushed or tilted.
- **Motor Control:**  Precise control of motor speeds is necessary to achieve balance.
- **Sensor Integration:** Accurate reading and processing of sensor data (IMU readings) are crucial.
- **Real-time Control:**  The PID controller needs to respond in real-time to maintain balance.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a user interface (e.g., using Pygame) to visualize sensor readings and control parameters. Integrate obstacle detection and avoidance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Sensor Data Acquisition:**  Write code to read sensor data (IMU) from the robot.  If using simulation, generate synthetic sensor data.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller algorithm in Python.  Start with initial PID gain values (Kp, Ki, Kd).
3. **Motor Control Integration:** Connect the PID controller output to the motor control signals.  In simulation, this will be a simulated motor response.
4. **Tuning & Calibration:** Iteratively adjust the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to optimize the robot's stability and responsiveness. Observe the system's behavior for overshoot, oscillations, and settling time.  This will require repeated testing and adjustment.
5. **Testing & Evaluation:**  Test the robot's stability under various conditions (e.g., pushing, tilting).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gain values can be challenging and requires iterative experimentation and understanding of PID control theory. A systematic approach like Ziegler-Nichols method is recommended.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world sensor data is noisy; implement appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) to reduce noise before feeding data to the controller.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning PID controllers, a cornerstone of control systems engineering.
- **Real-time System Development:** Develop skills in building and testing a real-time system that requires precise timing and responsiveness.
