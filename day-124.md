# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it.  The focus is on a quick prototyping cycle using a readily available game engine and a streamlined RL approach. The significance lies in gaining hands-on experience with RL concepts and their application in a game environment.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- Stable Baselines3 (or similar RL library like RLlib)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a maze navigation or a simple platformer).
    - An RL agent that learns to navigate the game environment and achieve a defined objective (e.g., reach a goal, collect items).
    - Basic reward system designed to guide the agent's learning.
    - Visualization of the agent's performance and learning progress.
    - Ability to save and load trained agent models.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
    - Incorporating a simple GUI to control game parameters and observe agent behavior.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Environment Design:** Create a minimal Pygame game environment with clear rules, objectives, and a state representation suitable for RL (e.g., agent position, object locations).
2. **RL Agent Setup:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., a simple Q-learning or a pre-built PPO agent from Stable Baselines3) and integrate it with the game environment. Define the state and action spaces.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that allows the agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy based on the chosen algorithm.
4. **Performance Evaluation:**  Evaluate the agent's performance using metrics like average reward or success rate over multiple episodes.
5. **Visualization and Saving:** Implement visualization to monitor training progress and save the trained agent model for later use.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards the desired behavior can be tricky.  Careful consideration is needed to avoid sparse or misleading rewards.
- **Computational Resources:** Training RL agents can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the game environment and using a less complex RL algorithm can mitigate this.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., states, actions, rewards, policies).
- Practical experience in using RL libraries like Stable Baselines3 and integrating them with a game environment.
