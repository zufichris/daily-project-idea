# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent utilizing the Minimax algorithm.  The game will include a visual representation of the board and the AI's decision-making process, allowing for observation of the algorithm's strategic choices. The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental AI concept in a simple, easily understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game visualization), NumPy (optional, for matrix representation of the board)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable Tic-Tac-Toe game with a human player vs. an AI opponent.
    - An AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
    - A visual representation of the game board using Pygame.
    - Display of the game state (e.g., current player, winning condition).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Visualization of the Minimax search tree (partially or at a reduced depth).
    - Difficulty levels adjusting the search depth of the Minimax algorithm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board Representation:** Create a data structure (list or NumPy array) to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
2. **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:**  Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency. This function will determine the best move for the AI.
3. **Game Logic:** Develop functions to handle player moves, win/draw conditions, and update the game board.
4. **Pygame Integration:** Use Pygame to create a visual representation of the board and handle user input.
5. **Game Loop:** Combine the game logic, AI, and Pygame to create a functional game loop.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Optimization:**  The Minimax algorithm can be computationally expensive for larger game trees.  Alpha-beta pruning is crucial for efficiency.  Consider limiting the search depth for a faster response if needed.
- **Pygame Integration:**  Handling user input and updating the visual representation efficiently can be challenging.  Careful structuring of the code is important.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Minimax Algorithm:** This project provides hands-on experience in implementing and understanding the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental concept in game AI.
- **Game Development Practice:**  This project strengthens skills in game development, including game logic, user interface design (using Pygame), and algorithm integration.
