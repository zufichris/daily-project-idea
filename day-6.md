# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus is on creating a functional, albeit rudimentary, RL agent within a short timeframe, highlighting core RL concepts.  The significance lies in quickly experiencing the development and implementation of RL algorithms, a crucial area in modern AI.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL algorithm)
- Jupyter Notebook/IDE of choice


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -  An RL agent (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA) trained to play the game.
    -  A simple visualization of the game and agent's decision-making process.
    -  Basic win/loss/draw tracking for evaluation.
    -  Ability to play against the AI.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Hyperparameter tuning to optimize agent performance.
    -  Implementation of a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network â€“ DQN for a more complex game).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment using Python and a library like Gym or by building a custom environment.  Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **RL Algorithm Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point). Implement the chosen algorithm, ensuring it interacts correctly with the game environment.
3. **Training & Evaluation:** Train the RL agent using the chosen algorithm.  This involves running numerous game simulations.  Evaluate its performance by playing against it or analyzing win/loss/draw statistics.
4. **Visualization:** Add basic visualization to show the game board and the agent's moves. This could be as simple as printing the board to the console.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time permits, refine the agent's performance by adjusting hyperparameters or exploring different RL algorithms.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining an effective reward function is crucial for successful RL training. A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal agent behavior.
- **Computational Resources:**  Training RL agents can be computationally intensive, especially for more complex games or algorithms.  Focus on a simple game and algorithm to stay within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and training a basic RL agent.
- **Agent-Environment Interaction:** Understanding how an RL agent interacts with its environment and learns through trial and error is a key takeaway.
