# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured via a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, waving) in real-time and trigger corresponding actions within a simulated smart home environment. This provides a hands-free, intuitive alternative to traditional voice or touch-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  Flask (optional: for a web interface)
* **Hardware:** Webcam (built-in or external)
* **Software:**  Suitable IDE (PyCharm, VS Code), Python 3.7+

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  Accurately identify predefined hand gestures from the webcam feed.
- **Action Mapping:**  Associate recognized gestures with specific smart home actions (e.g., thumbs up = increase room temperature, thumbs down = decrease).
- **Simulated Smart Home Environment:**  Create a simple interface showing the current state of virtual devices (lights, thermostat).
- **User Calibration (Optional):** Allow users to calibrate the system to their specific hand size and gestures for better accuracy.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for cases where gestures are not recognized or the webcam feed is interrupted.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe). Create a project structure and import libraries.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement the core gesture recognition logic using MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities. Focus on identifying 2-3 distinct gestures initially.
3. **Action Mapping & Simulation:** Develop a function to map recognized gestures to smart home actions. Create a simple graphical representation of the simulated smart home environment.
4. **Integration & Testing:** Integrate the gesture detection and action mapping. Test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time allows, implement user calibration or improve the robustness of gesture recognition by handling different hand sizes and orientations.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Consider incorporating techniques for image pre-processing (e.g., background subtraction, noise reduction).
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Similar gestures might be misinterpreted.  Focus on selecting distinct and easily distinguishable gestures for initial implementation.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of computer vision:**  Gain hands-on experience using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Software design principles:**  Practice modular design and implementation, focusing on creating reusable components and robust error handling.
