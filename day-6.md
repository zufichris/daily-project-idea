# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple system for calibrating a robotic arm's end-effector position using computer vision.  The system will utilize a camera to identify a target object and adjust the arm's position accordingly, improving its accuracy and precision. This is crucial for tasks requiring precise manipulation, making it a valuable skill for robotics engineers.  This daily challenge focuses on a simplified version, focusing on 2D calibration in a controlled environment.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
* **Robotics Framework:**  (Optional but recommended) Robot Operating System (ROS) - a simplified subset if time is limited.  Otherwise, direct motor control libraries depending on the robotic arm used.
* **Hardware:**  A robotic arm with at least 2 degrees of freedom, a webcam, a target object (e.g., a colored marker).

## Features & Requirements

- **Target Detection:** The system should accurately detect the target object in the camera's field of view using color filtering or object recognition.
- **Position Calculation:** Calculate the 2D pixel coordinates of the target relative to the camera.
- **Inverse Kinematics (Simplified):**  Implement a simplified inverse kinematics solution to calculate the joint angles required to move the end-effector to the target's location.  This will be limited to a simplified 2D model if using a more complex arm.
- **Arm Control:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the calculated position.
- **Error Reporting:** Display the calculated error between the target's actual and desired position.

- **Advanced Features:** Real-time feedback loop for continuous adjustment, 3D target detection and calibration.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Target Detection & Tracking:** Set up the camera and implement the target detection algorithm using OpenCV.  Track the target's movement in real time.
2. **Calibration Matrix:** Establish a relationship between pixel coordinates and real-world coordinates using a known distance and the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point).  A simplified approach can be used for this daily challenge.
3. **Simplified Inverse Kinematics:**  Develop a simplified inverse kinematics solution based on the robot arm's geometry. If the arm is more complex, use a lookup table for approximation, aiming for reasonable accuracy.
4. **Arm Control Integration:** Send the calculated joint angles to the robotic arm's control system to move the end-effector.
5. **Error Calculation and Display:** Calculate the error between the actual and desired position, and display the result (e.g., using a visual representation or numerical values).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Inverse Kinematics:**  A simplified approach will lead to inaccuracies.  The challenge lies in balancing accuracy with development time.
- **Camera Calibration:** Obtaining accurate camera parameters is crucial for precise results.  For a daily challenge, simplifying this step with assumptions is acceptable.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of computer vision techniques for object detection and tracking.
- Practical application of inverse kinematics in robotics, even in a simplified context.
