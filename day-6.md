#  Miniature Robot Maze Navigation with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple reinforcement learning agent to navigate a miniature maze using a simulated robot. The goal is to create a functional prototype demonstrating basic reinforcement learning principles within a constrained timeframe.  This showcases fundamental concepts in AI and robotics in a concise, tangible project.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:**  Stable Baselines3 (or similar, like RLlib)
- **Simulation Environment:** Pygame (for simplicity and rapid prototyping) or a minimal custom environment.
- **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements

- **Maze Generation:**  A simple algorithm to generate random, solvable mazes.
- **Robot Agent:** A simulated robot represented by a simple shape, capable of moving in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Reward System:** A reward function that positively reinforces reaching the goal and penalizes collisions with walls.
- **Training Loop:** An implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) to train the agent.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the robot navigating the maze during training and testing.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate a more complex maze generation algorithm (e.g., recursive backtracker). Add obstacle avoidance beyond simple wall collisions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the Pygame window and implement the maze generation algorithm. Define the robot's initial position and the goal location.
2. **Agent Creation:** Define the robot's action space (four movement directions) and observation space (maze representation). Initialize a reinforcement learning agent using Stable Baselines3 (or chosen library) with a suitable algorithm (e.g., PPO).
3. **Reward Function Implementation:**  Define the reward function to provide positive feedback for reaching the goal and negative feedback for collisions.
4. **Training:** Run the training loop, visualizing the robot's progress. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.
5. **Testing and Evaluation:** Test the trained agent on unseen mazes to evaluate its generalization capabilities.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the reinforcement learning algorithm might require experimentation.  Start with default values and iterate.
- **Maze Complexity:** Balancing maze complexity against training time is crucial.  Start with smaller, simpler mazes and gradually increase complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts, including agents, environments, reward functions, and training loops.
- **Simulation and Prototyping:**  This project improves skills in building and utilizing simple simulations for rapid prototyping and experimentation with AI algorithms.
