# Robotic Arm Calibration Using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a quick calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision techniques.  The goal is to accurately determine the end-effector's position and orientation in 3D space relative to a known reference point without relying on complex factory calibration procedures. This simplified approach is valuable for rapid prototyping and deployment of robotic systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, specific manufacturer SDK).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple one), a calibrated camera (or webcam with known intrinsics), a chessboard or other easily detectable pattern.

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:** Determine the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, rotation, and translation).
- **Target Detection:** Detect a known pattern (e.g., a chessboard) placed at various known locations within the robotic arm's workspace.
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the detected pattern using the camera calibration parameters.
- **Robot Arm Control (Optional):**  Move the robotic arm to pre-defined locations based on the estimated pose and verify accuracy.
- **Error Reporting:** Visualize the difference between the estimated and actual positions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function to obtain camera intrinsics using images of a chessboard pattern.
2. **Pattern Detection:** Detect the chessboard in images using OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners` function.
3. **Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to estimate the pose of the chessboard in the camera's coordinate system.  Transform this pose to the robot's coordinate system.
4. **(Optional) Robot Arm Control:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move to the estimated locations of the chessboard corners.
5. **Error Analysis:** Compare the actual robot arm positions to the estimated positions from computer vision, visualizing the error.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy requires careful consideration of camera calibration and lighting conditions. Noise in images can lead to inaccurate pose estimation.
- **Coordinate System Transformation:** Transforming coordinates between the camera and robot coordinate systems requires a precise understanding of the robot's kinematics and the relative position of the camera and robot.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of camera calibration, feature detection, and pose estimation.
- **Robotic Arm Control (Optional):**  Provides experience with integrating computer vision with robotic control, improving the understanding of sensor-based robotics.
