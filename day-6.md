# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a self-balancing robot arm using physics engines.  The simulation will focus on the control algorithms required to maintain balance while the arm moves, providing a foundational understanding of robotics control systems. This is a valuable exercise for understanding concepts like PID control and inverse kinematics in a manageable timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Physics Engine:** Pymunk (or Box2D)
- **Graphics Library:** Pygame (optional, for visualization)
- **IDE:**  VS Code, PyCharm, or similar.


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Arm Model:**  A 2D articulated robot arm with at least two segments (shoulder and elbow).
- **Balance Control:** Implementation of a PID controller to maintain the arm's base in an upright position despite movements.
- **Arm Movement:**  Ability to control the arm's joint angles programmatically.
- **Collision Detection:** Basic collision detection to prevent the arm from passing through obstacles (ground).
- **Simulation Visualization (Optional):** Real-time graphical representation of the arm's movement using Pygame.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporate a simple inverse kinematics algorithm to control the arm's end-effector position.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add a dynamic environment with moving obstacles.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pymunk, Pygame). Create a basic Pymunk space to represent the physics simulation environment.
2. **Create the Arm Model:** Model the robot arm using Pymunk bodies and joints. Define the arm segments' physical properties (mass, moment of inertia).
3. **Implement PID Control:** Develop a PID controller to adjust the base's angle based on the deviation from the upright position.
4. **Add Arm Movement Control:** Implement functions to control the arm's joint angles.  Initially, focus on simple joint angle control.
5. **(Optional) Visualize the Simulation:** Integrate Pygame to display the simulation, showing the arm's movement and its base angle.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains for stable balance might require iterative adjustments and understanding of PID controller behavior.  Start with simple gains and adjust.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation depends on the physics engine's capabilities and the accuracy of the arm's physical model. Simplifying assumptions might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control principles:**  Gain practical experience in designing and tuning a PID controller for a real-world (simulated) scenario.
- **Introduction to Robotics Simulation:** Learn basic concepts of robotics simulation using a physics engine and a programming language, gaining experience with modelling mechanisms in code.
