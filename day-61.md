# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a gesture-recognition system using a TinyML approach, specifically targeting control of a smart home device (e.g., a smart light). The system will utilize a low-power microcontroller and a sensor (accelerometer or IMU) to recognize predefined gestures, translating them into commands for the smart home device.  This explores the growing field of edge AI and its applicability in resource-constrained environments.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** MicroPython (for ease of prototyping) or C++ (for optimized performance).
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 (with built-in Wi-Fi and ample processing power).
- **Sensor:**  MPU6050 (6-axis IMU) or similar accelerometer.
- **Machine Learning Library:** TinyML libraries like TensorFlow Lite Micro or CMSIS-NN.
- **IDE:** PlatformIO, Arduino IDE, or VS Code with appropriate extensions.
- **Smart Home Integration:**  If time allows, integrate with a platform like Home Assistant via MQTT.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  The system should accurately capture accelerometer data representing distinct gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, circular motion for dimming).
- **Gesture Classification:**  Implement a simple machine learning model to classify captured gestures with reasonable accuracy.
- **Command Translation:** Map classified gestures to specific commands (e.g., "wave" -> "turn light on," "circle" -> "dim light").
- **Data Logging & Visualization (Optional):**  Log sensor data and model predictions for analysis and improvement.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual feedback (on an LED or serial monitor) indicating recognized gestures.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect accelerometer data for 3-4 distinct gestures, ensuring sufficient samples for training.
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, a small neural network) using the collected data.  Focus on a model suitable for TinyML deployment.
3. **Model Deployment:** Convert and optimize the trained model for the chosen microcontroller and library.
4. **Microcontroller Integration:** Integrate the model with the microcontroller, sensor, and smart home command execution logic.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system, analyzing performance and refining the model or data acquisition as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:** Obtaining clean and representative gesture data can be challenging; consider noise reduction techniques.
- **Model Optimization:**  Balancing model accuracy and resource usage (memory, processing power) is crucial for TinyML deployment.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Implementation:**  Gain practical experience in developing, training, and deploying machine learning models on a microcontroller.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Enhance skills in embedded systems programming, sensor interfacing, and data processing.
