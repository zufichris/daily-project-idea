# Automated Bug Triage System Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic prototype of an automated bug triage system that analyzes bug reports (e.g., from a simplified text input or a simulated bug tracker API) and categorizes them based on severity and priority. This is significant because it can save developers considerable time in manually sorting through numerous bug reports.  The focus will be on a proof-of-concept using basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- spaCy (NLP library)
- scikit-learn (machine learning library, optionally)
- Flask (or similar lightweight web framework, optional for a simple web interface)

## Features & Requirements

- **Bug Report Input:**  Accepts bug reports as plain text input.
- **Severity Classification:** Categorizes bugs into severity levels (e.g., critical, major, minor, trivial).
- **Priority Assignment:** Assigns priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) based on severity and other factors (optional, depending on time).
- **Keyword Extraction:** Extracts key terms and phrases from bug reports to aid in categorization.
- **Output Display:** Presents the categorized bug report with its assigned severity and priority.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a real bug tracker API (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues),  basic machine learning model training for improved categorization.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Create a small sample dataset of bug reports with manually assigned severity and priority labels.  Preprocess this data using spaCy (e.g., tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization).
2. **Feature Extraction:** Extract features from the preprocessed data (e.g., keywords, word counts, presence of specific phrases).
3. **Classification:** Use a simple classification algorithm (e.g., a rule-based system initially, then optionally a scikit-learn model like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression).
4. **Prototype Development:** Build a simple script or a basic web interface (using Flask) to take bug report input, process it through the classifier, and display the results.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the prototype with various bug report samples and refine the classification rules or model as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Bias:** A limited dataset may lead to biased classification results.  Addressing this may require carefully curating the training data or employing more robust machine learning techniques.
- **NLP Complexity:**  Achieving high accuracy with basic NLP techniques for diverse bug reports can be challenging.  Focus on a smaller scope initially and iterate based on results.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of NLP techniques for text classification.
- Experience in building a simple machine learning pipeline or rule-based system.
- Understanding the challenges of working with real-world, unstructured data.
