# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for a self-balancing robot simulated in a physics engine.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing using a minimal set of sensor data and control signals.  This project emphasizes practical application of control theory within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Physics Engine:** Pymunk (2D physics engine, readily available)
- **Libraries:**  NumPy (for numerical computations), Matplotlib (for visualization - optional)


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balancing:** The robot should maintain an upright position when perturbed slightly.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A PID controller should be implemented to adjust the motor speed based on angle and angular velocity.
- **Sensor Simulation:**  Simplified sensor readings (angle and angular velocity) are simulated within the Pymunk environment.
- **Motor Simulation:**  Simplified motor model (direct relationship between control signal and angular acceleration).
- **Real-time Visualization (Optional):** Display the robot's state (angle, motor speed) in real-time.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**  Set up the Pymunk environment, create a simple robot model (two circles connected by a rod), and implement basic physics.
2. **Sensor & Motor Simulation:** Implement functions to simulate angle and angular velocity sensors and a simplified motor model that responds to control signals.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement the PID controller algorithm with tunable gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).
4. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the PID controller with the simulated robot and sensors. Test the balance performance, adjusting PID gains iteratively.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If time permits, add visualization to monitor robot angle and motor speed over time.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains requires iterative adjustments and a good understanding of the effects of each gain on the system's response.  Starting with a simple P controller and gradually adding I and D terms is recommended.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** Pymunk's simplified physics might not perfectly represent real-world dynamics, potentially affecting the controller's performance when transferred to a physical robot.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Controller Design & Tuning:** Gain practical experience in designing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Robot Simulation and Control:**  Develop skills in using a physics engine to simulate a robotic system and implement basic control algorithms.
