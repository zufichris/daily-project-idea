# Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project focuses on building a quick and efficient inverse kinematics solver for a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).  Inverse kinematics is crucial for controlling robotic arms, allowing us to specify a desired end-effector position and calculate the required joint angles.  This project aims to create a standalone solver that can be easily integrated into a larger robotic control system or used as a standalone simulation tool.  The focus will be on speed and accuracy within the constraints of a 1-2 day timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), SciPy (for optimization algorithms), Matplotlib (for visualization - optional).


## Features & Requirements

- **Forward Kinematics Calculation:**  Accurately calculate the end-effector position given joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics Solver:** Implement an iterative solver (e.g., Jacobian Transpose or Newton-Raphson) to find joint angles for a given end-effector position.
- **Input/Output:**  Allow input of desired end-effector coordinates (x, y, z) and output the corresponding joint angles.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for cases where the desired position is unreachable.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Display the robotic arm and its movement using Matplotlib.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement a collision avoidance system (simplified collision detection with static obstacles).
- **Advanced Feature:** Allow for different robotic arm configurations (e.g., different link lengths).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Robot Model:**  Create a mathematical model of the 3-DOF robotic arm, defining its link lengths and joint types.
2. **Implement Forward Kinematics:**  Write a function to compute the end-effector position based on the joint angles.
3. **Implement Inverse Kinematics Solver:** Choose an iterative solver (e.g., Jacobian Transpose) and implement it.  Focus on efficiency and convergence.
4. **Test and Validate:**  Thoroughly test the solver with various inputs and compare the results with analytical solutions (if available).
5. **Add Visualization (Optional):** Integrate Matplotlib to visually represent the robotic arm's movements.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Solver Convergence:**  Iterative solvers may not always converge to a solution, especially for complex geometries or unreachable positions. Implement appropriate convergence criteria and error handling.
- **Singularities:** Robotic arms have configurations called singularities where the Jacobian matrix becomes singular, leading to unstable solutions.  Addressing this requires careful consideration of the chosen solver and potential singularity avoidance techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of robot kinematics:**  This project provides hands-on experience with forward and inverse kinematics, crucial concepts in robotics.
- **Develop proficiency in numerical methods:**  Implementing and optimizing iterative solvers strengthens skills in numerical computation and optimization algorithms.
