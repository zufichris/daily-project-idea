# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic mini-game using reinforcement learning (RL).  The chosen mini-game will be a simplified version of Pong, focusing on a single paddle controlling the vertical position to intercept a ball. This allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different RL algorithms within a limited timeframe. The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL in a constrained environment and exploring the trade-offs between different RL approaches.


## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar, like RLlib)
- **Game Engine (Optional):** Pygame (for visualization; can be skipped for a core RL focus)
- **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -   A simple Pong-like environment with a single paddle controlled by the AI.
    -   Implementation of a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    -   Training the AI agent to maximize the score (number of successfully intercepted balls).
    -   Basic reward system (positive reward for successful intercepts, negative for misses).
    -   Data logging of training progress (e.g., average reward per episode).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -   Visualization of the game and AI's actions using Pygame.
    -   Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the RL algorithm's performance.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create the simplified Pong environment. This involves defining the game rules, ball physics, and reward function.  If using Pygame, focus on a minimal, functional implementation.
2. **RL Algorithm Selection & Integration:** Choose an RL algorithm (PPO is recommended for its stability and ease of use with Stable Baselines3). Integrate the chosen algorithm with the environment.
3. **Training & Evaluation:** Train the AI agent for a set number of episodes or until a satisfactory performance level is achieved.  Evaluate the agent's performance by running several evaluation episodes and recording its average score.
4. **Data Analysis (Optional):** Analyze the training logs to understand the learning process and identify potential areas for improvement.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If using Pygame, implement visualization to show the game and the AI's actions during training and evaluation.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Resources:** Training RL agents can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the environment and using efficient RL algorithms mitigates this.  Consider using a pre-trained model as a starting point if time is very limited.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can significantly impact performance.  Start with default values and adjust based on initial results; extensive tuning might not be feasible in a short timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms.
- Hands-on experience with a popular RL library (Stable Baselines3).
- Understanding of the trade-offs between different RL algorithms and their suitability for specific tasks.
