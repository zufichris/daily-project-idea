# AI-Powered Real-time Object Tracking and Classification for a Robot Arm

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic prototype for an AI-powered system that allows a robotic arm to track and classify objects in real-time using a camera feed.  The significance lies in demonstrating a foundational element of advanced robotics – combining computer vision with robotic control.  This simplified version focuses on a single object type for a limited workspace.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch (machine learning), Robot Operating System (ROS) – simplified implementation (optional, can be simulated).
- **Hardware:**  A webcam (or simulated camera feed), a robotic arm (or a simulated robotic arm environment).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system should detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Once detected, the system should continuously track the object's position as it moves within the camera's view.
- **Classification Confirmation:**  The system should confirm the tracked object is indeed the target object (e.g., red ball) with a confidence score.
- **Basic Robotic Control (Optional):** The system should send commands to a simulated or real robotic arm to follow the tracked object, maintaining a set distance.
- **Data Visualization:**  Display the object's location and tracking information on the screen.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Object Detection Model:** Train or use a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet) using a dataset of images of the target object.
2. **Camera Integration:** Integrate the model with OpenCV to process the camera feed, identify the object, and obtain its coordinates.
3. **Tracking Algorithm:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) to predict the object's future position.
4. **Robotic Control (Optional):** If using a real or simulated robotic arm, interface with its control system using ROS or a similar framework. Send commands to move the arm based on the tracked object's location.
5. **Visualization:** Display the camera feed, bounding box around the tracked object, its coordinates, and the confidence score.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Efficiency:**  Balancing real-time processing with the accuracy of the object detection and tracking.  Consider using lighter-weight models and optimizations for faster inference.
- **Robustness:**  Dealing with occlusions or variations in lighting conditions that might affect object detection.  Explore techniques for handling these scenarios.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision techniques:**  Hands-on experience with object detection, tracking, and integration with real-time video processing.
- **Application of Machine Learning in Robotics:** Understanding the practical application of AI models in controlling robotic systems.
