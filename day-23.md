# Smart Home Device Integration with Minimalist API

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a minimalist API that allows seamless integration of various smart home devices (e.g., lights, thermostats, locks) without relying on extensive cloud platforms or SDKs.  The purpose is to demonstrate efficient data exchange and control using a lightweight approach, suitable for embedded systems or situations with limited network connectivity.  This avoids vendor lock-in and emphasizes interoperability.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with Flask or FastAPI for the API)
* **Database:** SQLite (for simplicity and local storage)
* **Communication Protocol:**  MQTT (for device communication - can be simulated)
* **Testing Framework:**  pytest (optional, for robust testing)


## Features & Requirements

- **Device Registration:**  API endpoint to register new devices with unique IDs and capabilities.
- **Data Acquisition:**  API endpoint to retrieve real-time status data from registered devices (e.g., temperature, light level).
- **Command Execution:**  API endpoint to send commands to registered devices (e.g., turn on/off a light, set thermostat temperature).
- **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling and logging for all API endpoints.
- **Authentication:**  Basic authentication (username/password) to secure API access.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementation of WebSockets for real-time updates,  integration with a simple GUI for visualization.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up API framework:** Choose Flask or FastAPI and create basic API endpoints for device registration.
2. **Implement data handling:** Integrate SQLite to store device information and establish API endpoints for data acquisition and command execution.  Simulate device communication using mock data initially.
3. **Develop communication layer:**  Integrate a simplified MQTT client/server (or simulated communication) for interfacing with virtual devices.
4. **Implement authentication:** Add basic authentication mechanisms to secure API endpoints.
5. **Test & Refine:**  Thoroughly test all API endpoints and refine the design based on test results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time data handling:**  Managing real-time updates from multiple devices might require careful asynchronous programming and queue management.  Using mock data initially mitigates this.
- **Security:** Implementing robust security measures beyond basic authentication is crucial in a production environment but may be outside the scope of a single day's work.


## Learning Outcomes

- **API design and development:** This project strengthens skills in RESTful API design, endpoint implementation, and data handling using a lightweight framework.
- **Lightweight communication protocols:** Practical experience with MQTT (or a similar protocol) for device communication and its advantages over heavier alternatives.
