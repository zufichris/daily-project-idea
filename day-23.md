# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Mobile Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated mobile robot navigating a complex environment with obstacles.  The goal is to create a system that efficiently finds the shortest or most optimal path, considering factors like obstacle avoidance and movement constraints. This is a practical application of pathfinding algorithms, relevant to robotics, autonomous vehicles, and game AI.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NetworkX (optional, for graph representation and algorithms)
- **Algorithm:** A* search algorithm (with potential for optimization using heuristics like Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance)


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Representation:**  The environment will be represented as a grid with obstacles marked as impassable cells.
- **Pathfinding:** Implement the A* search algorithm to find a path from a start point to a goal point, avoiding obstacles.
- **Visualization:**  Use Pygame to visually represent the environment, obstacles, the robot's path, and the search process.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a path smoothing algorithm (e.g., BÃ©zier curves) to reduce the number of sharp turns in the generated path.
- **Performance Measurement:**  Track and display the time taken to find the path.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the grid-based environment using Pygame, allowing for easy placement of obstacles and the start/goal points.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path, considering obstacle avoidance.  Focus on efficient implementation for speed.
3. **Visualization:**  Integrate the Pygame visualization to show the environment, the search process (e.g., explored nodes), and the final path.
4. **Performance Testing:**  Run the algorithm with varying obstacle densities and map sizes to evaluate performance and identify bottlenecks.
5. **(Optional) Path Smoothing:**  Implement a path smoothing technique if time permits, improving the robot's trajectory.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:**  For large environments, the A* algorithm can become computationally expensive.  Consider optimizing the algorithm (e.g., using heuristics or more efficient data structures).
- **Heuristic Selection:** Choosing the right heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance vs. Euclidean distance) can significantly impact performance. Experimentation is key.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of pathfinding algorithms:** This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and optimizing the A* algorithm.
- **Develop skills in algorithm optimization:**  Addressing performance challenges will enhance the ability to improve the efficiency of algorithms.
