# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI Feedback

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype tool that automatically enforces a specific code style guide using AI-powered feedback. The tool will analyze code snippets and provide suggestions for improvement based on pre-defined rules and machine learning models trained on a curated dataset of styled and unstyled code. This is significant as maintaining consistent code style across large projects is crucial for readability, maintainability, and collaboration.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Tree parsing), `flake8` (for linting),  `transformers` (for using a pre-trained code-understanding model like CodeBERT or similar), `flask` (for a simple web interface â€“ optional).


## Features & Requirements

- **Code Style Analysis:**  The tool will parse input code and identify violations against a predefined style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- **AI-Powered Suggestions:** The tool will leverage a pre-trained code model to suggest improvements beyond simple linting, including stylistic recommendations and potentially identifying more subtle issues.
- **Feedback Generation:** The tool will generate clear and actionable feedback, highlighting problematic code sections and suggesting corrections.
- **Configurable Style Guide:** The tool should allow users to customize the style guide to some extent (e.g., line length, indentation).
- **Basic Reporting:** The tool will provide a summary of detected issues and the number of violations.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integration with a version control system (e.g., GitHub) for automated code review.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  A user-friendly web interface for easier interaction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and download a pre-trained code understanding model (or train a simple one on a small dataset).
2. **Code Parsing & Analysis:** Implement functions to parse the input code using `ast`, identify style violations using `flake8`, and feed the parsed code to the pre-trained model.
3. **Feedback Generation:**  Develop the logic to generate meaningful feedback based on the analysis results and model predictions. This involves combining the results from `flake8` and the AI model's suggestions.
4. **Output & Reporting:** Design the output format for feedback (e.g., a simple console output or a more structured report).
5. **(Optional) Web Interface:** If time allows, create a simple web interface using `flask` for easier interaction.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of AI Model:** The quality of the feedback depends heavily on the accuracy of the pre-trained code model.  Using a well-trained, publicly available model mitigates this risk but may not perfectly align with a specific style guide.
- **Computational Cost:** Processing large codebases can be computationally intensive, especially when using large language models. Focusing on smaller snippets for the initial prototype addresses this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of AI in software engineering:**  This project provides hands-on experience in using AI models for code analysis and improvement.
- **Advanced code analysis techniques:**  Working with Abstract Syntax Trees and integrating different code analysis tools enhances understanding of code structure and analysis methodologies.
