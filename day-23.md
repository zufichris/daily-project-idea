# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a system that uses a computer vision model to detect and track a specific object in real-time, feeding the object's coordinates to a robotic arm for precise manipulation.  The goal is to create a functional prototype demonstrating basic pick-and-place functionality within a constrained environment. This showcases the integration of computer vision and robotics, a core aspect of modern automation.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV (cv2)
* **Machine Learning Library:** TensorFlow/Keras (pre-trained model or a very simple, fast model)
* **Robotics Framework:** ROS (Robot Operating System) - simplified approach might be possible without full ROS, depending on robotic arm interface
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot Magician, UR3e â€“ a simulated arm is acceptable for a rapid prototype), a webcam or camera.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Real-time detection of a predefined object (e.g., a red cube) using a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Object Tracking:** Continuous tracking of the detected object as it moves within the camera's field of view.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Conversion of pixel coordinates from the camera to the robot arm's coordinate system.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** Sending commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the object's location.
- **Pick-and-Place Action:**  Successfully picking up and placing the detected object in a designated location.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Error handling and recovery mechanisms (e.g., object not found, arm collision avoidance).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate a more robust object detection model (YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) for better accuracy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, ROS if applicable) and connect the camera and robotic arm. Load a pre-trained object detection model or train a very simple model for the specific object.
2. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Implement a loop that continuously captures frames from the camera, runs the object detection model, and tracks the object's bounding box using OpenCV's tracking functionalities.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:**  Develop a function to convert the pixel coordinates of the object's centroid to the robot arm's coordinate system. This might involve calibration procedures (simpler if using a simulated robot arm).
4. **Robot Arm Control:** Write code to send the calculated coordinates to the robotic arm, instructing it to move to the object's location. Use the appropriate communication protocol for your robotic arm.
5. **Pick-and-Place Execution:** Implement the pick-and-place logic, including commands for gripper opening/closing and movement to the drop-off location.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Coordinate System Transformation:** Accurately converting pixel coordinates to robot arm coordinates can be complex, especially in a real-world setup.  Careful calibration and consideration of camera parameters are crucial. Using a simulator for prototyping could significantly simplify this.
- **Robustness:**  Dealing with lighting changes, occlusions, and variations in object pose can significantly impact the reliability of the object detection and tracking. Using a more robust object detection model can alleviate some of this, but within the daily constraint, a simpler approach might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Integration of Computer Vision and Robotics:** This project reinforces the practical application of computer vision techniques for robotic control.
- **Real-time System Development:**  Building a real-time system that processes data from a camera and controls a robotic arm improves understanding of timing constraints and efficient code organization.
