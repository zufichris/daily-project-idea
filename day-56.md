# Self-Healing Robotic Arm Path Planning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simplified simulation of a robotic arm with a self-healing path planning algorithm. The arm will need to navigate a dynamic obstacle course while adapting its path in real-time if an unexpected obstacle appears or a pre-planned path becomes blocked. This will involve implementing a basic pathfinding algorithm and incorporating a reactive element that allows for dynamic path adjustments.  The significance lies in exploring efficient path planning in unpredictable environments, a crucial aspect of advanced robotics.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for visualization)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A* search algorithm implementation (can be found readily online)

## Features & Requirements
- **Basic Path Planning:** The robotic arm should be able to plan a collision-free path from a starting point to a target point using the A* algorithm, given a known map of obstacles.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:**  The arm should detect and avoid new obstacles that appear during execution.
- **Path Replanning:** When an obstacle is detected, the arm should recalculate its path efficiently using the A* algorithm to reach the target.
- **Visualization:** The project should visualize the robot arm, obstacles, and the planned path using Pygame.
- **Basic Arm Kinematics:** Simulate a 2-DOF robotic arm with simple forward and inverse kinematics.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated path planning algorithm like RRT* for smoother paths and better handling of complex environments.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporate a simple learning component where the arm learns to avoid specific obstacle locations over multiple runs.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries (Pygame, NumPy) and create the basic Pygame window for visualization.
2. **Implement A* Search:** Integrate a pre-existing or self-implemented A* search algorithm to find the initial path.  Focus on a simple grid-based representation.
3. **Simulate Robotic Arm:**  Create a simple representation of a 2-DOF robotic arm and implement basic forward and inverse kinematics.
4. **Obstacle Detection and Replanning:**  Implement obstacle detection (e.g., by checking for collisions with pre-defined obstacle coordinates or dynamically added obstacles). If a collision is detected, use the A* algorithm to recalculate the path.
5. **Visualization:**  Display the robot arm, obstacles, and the planned path in the Pygame window.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Efficiency:**  Path replanning needs to be fast enough to react in real-time to dynamic changes.  The choice of the A* implementation and the map representation are critical here.
- **Path Smoothing:**  A* paths can be jagged. Advanced features might address this, or a post-processing smoothing step can be added.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of pathfinding algorithms (specifically A*) and their implementation.
- Practical experience in integrating path planning with basic robotics simulations and visualization.
