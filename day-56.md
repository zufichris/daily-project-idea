# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimalistic game using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating fundamental RL concepts, rather than building a sophisticated game or AI.  The game will be designed for easy implementation and fast training, allowing for visible progress within a day or two.  This showcases practical application of RL in a contained environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Reinforcement Learning Library: Stable Baselines3 (or similar, like RLlib)
- Game Engine/Library: Pygame (for simplicity)
- IDE: VS Code or PyCharm

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., navigating a maze to reach a goal).
    - An AI agent controlled by a simple reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
    - Training the agent through interactions with the environment.
    - Visualization of the agent's progress and learning curve.
    - Basic reward system (e.g., positive reward for reaching the goal, negative for hitting obstacles).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).
    - Adding more complex game mechanics (e.g., multiple goals, moving obstacles).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Design and implement the simple 2D game using Pygame. This could be a simple maze or a grid-based environment.  Focus on clear reward structures.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (PPO recommended for ease of use) from Stable Baselines3 and integrate it with the game environment. Define the agent's action space and observation space.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that allows the agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its policy based on the chosen RL algorithm.
4. **Visualization:** Implement basic visualization to show the agent's progress in the game and its learning curve (e.g., plot the rewards over time).
5. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance by letting it play the game without training and observing its success rate.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require some experimentation. Start with default values and adjust as needed.  Focus on a single hyperparameter adjustment to limit scope.
- **Reward Shaping:**  Designing an effective reward system is crucial for efficient learning. Poorly designed rewards can lead to suboptimal agent behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project will reinforce understanding of key RL concepts like agents, environments, rewards, policies, and the training process.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Hands-on experience with using a popular RL library like Stable Baselines3 will be gained, improving familiarity with its functionalities and common workflows.
