#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module.  The goal is to create a proof-of-concept system that can autonomously navigate a simple obstacle course within a confined space.  This project emphasizes practical application of computer vision and real-time control in a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2, miniature drone (e.g., a small quadcopter with a compatible flight controller), power supply.
* **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), a suitable drone control library (e.g., dronekit-sitl if using a simulated drone or a manufacturer-specific library for a physical drone), potentially TensorFlow Lite for faster on-device processing (optional).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect obstacles (e.g., simple objects like boxes or cones) in the drone's camera feed using OpenCV.
- **Obstacle Distance Estimation:**  Estimate the distance to detected obstacles using image processing techniques or depth information (if available from the camera).
- **Autonomous Avoidance Maneuver:** Implement basic avoidance logic (e.g., turning or adjusting altitude) based on detected obstacles and their distances.
- **Emergency Stop Mechanism:** Include a mechanism to safely land the drone in case of unexpected errors or loss of control.
- **Simplified User Interface:**  A basic interface (even a text-based one) to start and stop the avoidance system.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Path Planning:** Implement a simple path planning algorithm (e.g., A*) to navigate a more complex course efficiently.
- **TensorFlow Lite Integration:**  Optimize object detection for faster processing using TensorFlow Lite.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Calibration:** Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi, configure the droneâ€™s flight controller, and test basic drone control commands.  Calibrate the camera if necessary.
2. **Object Detection Implementation:** Implement object detection using OpenCV.  Focus on a simple algorithm like color thresholding or a pre-trained model for faster development.
3. **Distance Estimation & Avoidance Logic:** Implement distance estimation (potentially using perspective or a simpler method) and define the avoidance maneuvers based on distance thresholds.
4. **Integration with Drone Control:** Integrate the object detection and avoidance logic with the drone's flight control system.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system in a controlled environment, refine parameters, and address any issues encountered.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Processing Constraints:**  Processing the camera feed and controlling the drone simultaneously in real-time can be challenging.  Consider simplifying the object detection algorithm for faster processing.
- **Drone Stability:** Maintaining drone stability while performing avoidance maneuvers can be difficult. Careful tuning of the control parameters and potentially employing a PID controller will be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience in real-time object detection and image processing techniques using OpenCV.
- **Embedded Systems and Robotics:**  Reinforce knowledge in integrating software with hardware components in a robotic system for real-time control.
