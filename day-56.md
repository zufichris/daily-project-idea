# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves developing a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and understanding the core concepts of RL, rather than building a complex and polished game. The significance lies in gaining practical experience with RL and applying it to a tangible problem within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL implementation)
- Tools:  A suitable Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a Pong-like game or a simple maze navigation).
    - An AI opponent controlled by a Q-learning algorithm.
    - A basic reward system to guide the AI's learning.
    - Real-time visualization of the game and AI's actions.
    - Ability to train the AI and observe its improvement over time.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    - Add a simple user interface to adjust game parameters and RL hyperparameters.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Design and implement the basic game mechanics using Pygame.  This should include player controls (for the human player, if desired), collision detection, and scorekeeping.
2. **Environment Definition:** Define the game environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the RL algorithm.  This involves specifying the state space, action space, and reward function.
3. **RL Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.  This will involve defining the Q-function, updating the Q-values based on the observed rewards, and selecting actions based on an epsilon-greedy strategy.
4. **Training and Evaluation:** Train the RL agent by letting it play against itself or a simple rule-based opponent.  Observe the agent's performance and adjust parameters as needed.
5. **Visualization:** Implement visualization of the game and the AI's learning process (e.g., plot the rewards over time).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**  Finding the optimal balance between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions that have yielded high rewards) is crucial for effective RL. Experiment with different epsilon-greedy strategies.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior.  Careful consideration is needed to ensure that the reward function accurately reflects the desired behavior.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., Q-learning, Markov Decision Processes).
- Experience with implementing and training an RL agent in a simple game environment.
- Application of a popular deep learning library (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) for RL.
