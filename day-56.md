# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus is on creating a minimal viable product (MVP) demonstrating real-time gesture recognition with a limited set of commands. This project emphasizes efficient development and streamlined implementation, ideal for a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for faster inference if pre-trained model is used)
- **Hardware:** Webcam (any standard webcam will suffice)
- **Software:** IDE (VS Code or PyCharm), suitable Python environment


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Hand Detection:** Accurately detect and track the user's hand in the webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize a small set of predefined gestures (e.g., open hand for "lights on", closed fist for "lights off", pointing for "increase volume").
- **Smart Home Integration (Simulated):**  Simulate smart home control by printing commands to the console.  Integration with actual smart home APIs is optional.
- **User Interface:** Basic graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter to display the camera feed and recognized gestures.
- **Calibration:** Allow initial calibration to adjust to different hand sizes and lighting conditions.

**Advanced Features (Optional):**
- Integration with a real smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant).
- Multi-gesture recognition (e.g., sequential gestures for more complex commands).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Hand Detection and Tracking:** Implement hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe's hand detection model in OpenCV.  Focus on extracting relevant landmarks (e.g., fingertip positions).
2. **Gesture Classification:** Define a small set of simple gestures and design a basic classification algorithm based on the hand landmark positions (e.g., Euclidean distance between landmarks).  A simple rule-based approach or a small, trained machine learning model could be used.
3. **Smart Home Simulation:** Create a function that simulates sending commands to smart home devices based on the recognized gestures (printing commands to the console is sufficient for an MVP).
4. **GUI Development:** Create a simple GUI using Tkinter to display the camera feed and the recognized gestures in real-time.
5. **Calibration (Optional):** Add basic calibration functionality to adjust threshold values for gesture recognition based on user's hand size.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** The accuracy might be limited with a simple rule-based approach; careful feature selection and threshold tuning are crucial.  This can be mitigated by using a pre-trained model for classification.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting conditions can affect the accuracy of hand detection.  Robustness to lighting changes needs to be considered, potentially through image pre-processing techniques.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of computer vision techniques:** Gain hands-on experience with real-time image processing, hand detection, and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Rapid prototyping and MVP development:** Learn how to quickly build a functional prototype with limited resources and time, focusing on core functionality first.
