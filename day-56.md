# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple computer vision system to calibrate a robotic arm's end-effector position.  The system will use a known object (e.g., a colored marker) in the robot's workspace, detected by a camera, to correct for any positional inaccuracies in the robot's internal model.  This is crucial for improving the precision of robotic manipulation tasks.  The goal is to create a functional prototype demonstrably improving accuracy within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, specific manufacturer's SDK).
* **Hardware:** Robotic arm (any affordable 3-DOF or higher), Webcam or USB camera.
* **Tools:** IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm), potentially a ROS environment if using a ROS-compatible arm.

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) using a checkerboard pattern.
- **Marker Detection:** Detect and locate a colored marker (e.g., a red circle) in the camera's field of view using OpenCV's color filtering and contour detection.
- **Position Estimation:** Calculate the 3D position of the marker relative to the camera using known camera parameters and marker dimensions.
- **Robot Arm Control:** Command the robot arm to move its end-effector to the estimated marker position.
- **Error Correction (Optional):** Implement a feedback loop to iteratively refine the robot's position based on the difference between the commanded and observed positions.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more robust marker detection algorithm that can handle varying lighting conditions and occlusions.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Use a more sophisticated camera model (e.g., including lens distortion correction) for more precise calculations.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration & Setup:** Calibrate the camera using OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function with a checkerboard pattern.  Connect the camera and robotic arm, ensuring communication is established.
2. **Marker Detection:** Implement a function to detect and locate the colored marker in each camera frame using color filtering and contour analysis.
3. **Position Calculation:** Use the camera parameters and marker properties to estimate the 3D position of the marker in the camera's coordinate system. Convert this to the robot's coordinate system using a known transformation matrix (this may require manual measurement and setup).
4. **Robot Arm Control:** Write a function to send commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the calculated marker position.
5. **Testing & Iteration:** Test the system repeatedly, comparing the commanded position to the actual position. Refine the transformation matrix and/or calibration parameters as necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Coordinate System Transformation:** Accurately transforming coordinates between the camera and robot coordinate systems can be challenging and might require careful measurement and understanding of the robot's kinematics.
- **Lighting and Occlusion:**  Varying lighting conditions and potential occlusions of the marker can affect the accuracy of detection. Robust algorithms are needed to mitigate these issues.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Reinforce understanding of camera calibration, image processing, and object detection techniques.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** Gain practical experience in controlling a robotic arm and integrating it with a computer vision system.  This will enhance understanding of robot kinematics and coordinate transformations.
