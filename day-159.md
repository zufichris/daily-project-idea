# Self-Balancing Robot Controller Optimization

## Overview

This project aims to optimize the control algorithm for a self-balancing robot (e.g., a two-wheeled robot) using a PID controller.  The goal is to improve the robot's stability and responsiveness to disturbances while minimizing overshoot and settling time.  This is a practical application of control systems theory and provides a tangible demonstration of algorithm tuning.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID controller implementation and potentially optimization algorithms), possibly a robotics simulation library like PyBullet or a microcontroller interface library if working with a physical robot.
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A two-wheeled self-balancing robot kit (e.g., Arduino-based), motor drivers, sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope).


## Features & Requirements

- **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement a PID controller to maintain the robot's balance.
- **Sensor Data Acquisition:**  Read sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) to determine the robot's orientation and angular velocity.
- **Motor Control:**  Send appropriate control signals to the motors based on the PID controller output.
- **Stability Testing:**  Implement a routine to test the robot's stability under various disturbances (e.g., simulated pushes or external forces).
- **Data Logging:** Log sensor data and controller output for analysis and visualization.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):** Implement an optimization algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm or gradient descent) to automatically tune the PID gains for optimal performance.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Incorporate a Kalman filter to improve the accuracy of sensor data fusion.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and connect to the robot (if using physical hardware).  If using simulation, set up the robot model in the chosen simulator.
2. **Implement the basic PID controller:**  Write the core PID control logic using NumPy/SciPy.  Start with initial (potentially arbitrary) PID gains.
3. **Integrate sensor data acquisition and motor control:**  Read sensor data, process it to obtain angle and angular velocity, and use the PID controller output to drive the motors (simulated or physical).
4. **Test and tune the PID controller:**  Run stability tests and manually adjust PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to improve performance. Observe the response to disturbances, aiming for minimal overshoot and fast settling time.  Log and visualize the results.
5. **(Optional) Implement optimization:** If time permits, implement an optimization algorithm to automatically find better PID gains.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Gain Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Understanding the impact of each gain (Kp, Ki, Kd) is crucial.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world sensor data is often noisy, which can affect the controller's performance.  Filtering techniques (e.g., moving average, Kalman filter) might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of PID control:**  Gain hands-on experience in implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental control algorithm.
- **Practical application of control systems theory:**  Apply theoretical concepts to a real-world problem, gaining a deeper understanding of how control systems work in practice.
