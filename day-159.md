# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a self-balancing robotic arm using a simple, single-jointed configuration.  The goal is to develop a control system using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control to maintain the arm's balance despite external disturbances. This project provides a practical application of control systems theory, suitable for rapid prototyping and testing within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in its educational value and potential for extension into more complex robotic systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below)
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (alternative: simulated environment)
* **Sensors:** MPU6050 (6-axis IMU) for angular velocity and acceleration data
* **Actuator:** Servo motor (e.g., SG90)
* **Libraries:**  `PySerial` (for Arduino communication), `mpu6050` (for IMU data acquisition), potentially a PID control library.
* **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
* **Hardware:** Breadboard, Jumper wires


## Features & Requirements

- **IMU Data Acquisition:** Read acceleration and gyroscope data from the MPU6050.
- **PID Control Implementation:** Develop a PID controller to maintain a desired angle (e.g., vertical).
- **Servo Motor Control:** Use the PID output to control the servo motor and adjust the arm's angle.
- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain its upright position even with small disturbances.
- **Data Visualization:** Display real-time sensor data and controlled servo angle.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a Kalman filter to improve the accuracy of the sensor readings.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add a simple object detection capability (using a camera module and OpenCV) to allow the arm to interact with objects.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the Arduino.  Verify sensor readings and servo motor functionality.
2. **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Write Arduino code to read and transmit IMU data via serial communication to the computer.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Develop Python code to receive data, implement the PID algorithm, calculate the required servo angle, and send control signals back to the Arduino.
4. **Control Loop Integration:** Integrate steps 2 and 3 into a continuous control loop. Fine-tune the PID gains for optimal performance.
5. **Data Visualization (Optional):** Plot sensor data and the controlled servo angle using Matplotlib or similar library.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains might require iterative adjustments and understanding of the system's dynamics.  Start with conservative values and gradually increase them.
- **Sensor Noise:**  The IMU data might be noisy; consider using filtering techniques (e.g., moving average or Kalman filter) to improve accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing a PID controller for a real-world robotic system.
- **Sensor Integration and Data Acquisition:** Improve skills in interfacing with sensors, processing sensor data, and implementing data communication protocols.
