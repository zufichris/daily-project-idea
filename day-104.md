# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic self-balancing robotic arm controlled via a simple interface (e.g., keyboard input). The focus is on implementing and tuning a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to maintain the arm's balance against disturbances. This is a challenging yet achievable task within a day or two for an experienced software engineer or roboticist.  The project highlights practical application of control theory concepts within a robotics context.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for interface), NumPy (for numerical computation), a robotics simulator (e.g., PyBullet, V-REP) or physical hardware (Arduino, servo motors).
* **Tools:**  Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text), Python interpreter.

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Arm Simulation/Control:**  Simulate or control a simple 2-DOF robotic arm.
- **Balance Maintenance:** Implement a PID controller to maintain the arm's balance around a setpoint (e.g., vertical position).
- **User Input:** Allow users to apply disturbances (e.g., via keyboard input pushing the arm).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display the arm's angle and PID controller output in real-time.
- **Data Logging:** Optionally log the arm's angle and controller output for analysis.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more sophisticated control algorithm (e.g., LQR).
- **Optional Feature:** Add visual feedback (e.g., using Pygame graphics) to show the arm's position and balance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Simulation/Hardware Connection:** Set up the chosen simulator (or connect physical hardware) and import necessary libraries. Define the arm's dynamics (e.g., inertia, mass).
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID controller algorithm. Initialize PID gains (P, I, D) with reasonable starting values.
3. **Control Loop:** Create a control loop that continuously reads the arm's angle, computes the control signal using the PID controller, and applies the control signal to the arm.
4. **User Interface:** Create a simple interface (e.g., using Pygame) for applying disturbances or setting desired angles.
5. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the controller's performance and fine-tune the PID gains (P, I, D) to achieve optimal balance and responsiveness.  Experiment with different gain values to observe their effects.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments.  Start with conservative values and gradually increase them.
- **Simulation vs. Reality:**  If using physical hardware, account for noise, friction, and other real-world factors not present in simulation. The PID gains will likely need adjustment depending on which method is used.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Controller Implementation:** Gain practical experience in implementing and tuning PID controllers, a fundamental concept in control systems.
- **Robotics Control:**  Understand the challenges and techniques involved in controlling a robotic system in real-time or via simulation.
