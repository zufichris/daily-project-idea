# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera's field of view, track its movement, and display the object's coordinates on the screen. This project demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts and real-time processing capabilities, suitable for a short-term challenge.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB camera.
- **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV library, NumPy.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using color thresholding.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position frame-by-frame, calculating its centroid.
- **Real-time Display:** Display the camera feed with a bounding box around the detected object and its coordinates overlaid.
- **Performance Monitoring:**  Display the frames-per-second (FPS) to assess the system's performance.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log the object's coordinates over time to a file.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a more robust object detection algorithm (e.g., using Haar cascades or a pre-trained deep learning model like YOLOv5-tiny for faster inference) instead of simple color thresholding.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Incorporate a simple prediction model to estimate the object's future trajectory based on its past movements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi and install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`).
2. **Object Detection:** Write a function to capture frames from the camera, apply color thresholding to isolate the object, and find its centroid.
3. **Tracking:** Implement a loop to continuously capture frames, detect the object, track its centroid across frames, and draw a bounding box around it.
4. **Display:** Display the processed video feed with overlaid information (bounding box, coordinates, FPS).
5. **Optimization (Optional):** If FPS is low, explore optimization techniques like reducing image resolution or using a more efficient algorithm.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:**  The Raspberry Pi might struggle with computationally intensive algorithms, requiring optimization to achieve a reasonable FPS. This can be addressed by using smaller image resolutions or simpler object detection methods initially.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Changes in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of color thresholding.  Consider using more robust techniques like adaptive thresholding or employing more advanced algorithms for improved robustness.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time image processing:** This project reinforces practical skills in processing video streams in real-time and understanding the trade-off between accuracy and performance.
- **Object detection and tracking:**  Gain hands-on experience with basic computer vision techniques, including color thresholding and centroid tracking.  The optional advanced features will allow for exploration of more sophisticated approaches.
