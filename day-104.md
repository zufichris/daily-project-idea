# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning. The focus is on building a functional AI within a short timeframe, showcasing the core concepts of reinforcement learning and its application in game playing.  The significance lies in understanding the fundamental principles of RL and its ability to learn optimal strategies without explicit programming.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A suitable game library (e.g., Pygame for simple game visualization, or a custom implementation)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - An environment (game board) for Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.
    - An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).
    - A training loop to iteratively improve the AI's strategy.
    - A simple user interface for human interaction (optional but recommended).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Data visualization of the learning process (e.g., plotting reward over time).
    - Ability to save and load trained models.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the environment:** Create the game board and define the game rules using Python and a chosen game library.
2. **Implement the reinforcement learning algorithm:** Choose an algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement its core logic in Python using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
3. **Train the AI agent:** Run the training loop, letting the agent play against itself or a simple rule-based opponent.  Focus on a limited number of training iterations for the time constraint.
4. **Test and evaluate:** Play against the trained AI to assess its performance.  Observe the win rate and identify any weaknesses.
5. **(Optional) Enhance user interface:** Add basic graphical elements to visualize the game state and improve user interaction.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  Reinforcement learning can be computationally intensive.  Limit the complexity of the game and the number of training iterations to manage within the timeframe. Consider using simpler algorithms or reducing the exploration rate.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) for the reinforcement learning algorithm requires experimentation. Begin with default values and adjust based on observed performance.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:** This project strengthens the understanding of core reinforcement learning concepts, such as reward, state, action, and policy.
- **Practical Application of Deep Learning Frameworks:**  It provides hands-on experience using PyTorch or TensorFlow for a practical problem, enhancing familiarity with these powerful tools.
