# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a simple self-balancing robotic arm using a microcontroller and sensor feedback. The arm will attempt to maintain a pre-defined angle despite external disturbances. This demonstrates fundamental control system concepts and provides a practical application of PID control algorithms.  The focus is on achieving stable balancing within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (for its built-in IMU) or similar.
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)
* **Sensors:**  MPU6050 (6-axis IMU) -  Gyroscope and accelerometer data are crucial for feedback.
* **Actuator:** Servo Motor (high torque recommended).
* **Framework/Libraries:**  No external framework is strictly necessary.  Basic Arduino libraries will suffice.  A PID control library could be used for convenience, but implementing it from scratch is a valuable learning experience.
* **Tools:**  Soldering iron, breadboard, jumper wires, 3D printer (optional - for a custom arm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain a specified angle (e.g., 45 degrees) against small external disturbances (e.g., gentle pushes).
- **IMU Integration:** Accurate reading and processing of accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to adjust the servo motor position based on the error between the desired and actual angle.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide real-time visual feedback (e.g., serial monitor output) of the arm's angle and controller output.
- **Angle Adjustment:**  Allow the user to set the target angle via serial communication.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporating a Kalman filter for sensor fusion to improve data accuracy. Adding a visual feedback mechanism (e.g., controlling an LED based on error).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the MPU6050 and servo motor to the microcontroller.  Test sensor readings and servo motor control.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the MPU6050 to obtain accurate readings in a stable position.
3. **PID Control Implementation:** Implement a basic PID control algorithm to adjust the servo motor based on the error calculated from the desired and measured angles. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) for optimal performance.
4. **Real-time Feedback:** Display the current angle, error, and control output on the serial monitor.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the arm's ability to self-balance and adjust PID gains as needed to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative testing and adjustment.  Start with conservative values and gradually increase them.
- **Sensor Noise:**  The IMU readings might contain noise.  Consider using a simple moving average filter to reduce noise before feeding data to the PID controller.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** Gain practical experience in implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental control system algorithm.
- **Embedded Systems Development:**  Reinforce skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time control.
