# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimalistic game using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The game will be designed for rapid prototyping and allows for observation of RL algorithm effectiveness in a short timeframe. This demonstrates a practical application of RL concepts without requiring extensive data sets or complex game engines.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D grid-based game environment (e.g., navigating a maze to reach a goal).
    - An RL agent (e.g., using Q-learning or a simple Deep Q-Network).
    - Training the agent for a limited number of episodes.
    - Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting rewards over time).
    - Basic game state logging (actions and rewards).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
    -  Saving and loading the trained agent's model.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Design:** Create a minimalistic game environment using Gym or a custom Python class.  Define the state space, action space, reward function, and terminal conditions.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning or a simple DQN). Implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on the current state.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that iterates over multiple game episodes, allowing the agent to learn from its experiences.  Record relevant metrics.
4. **Visualization:**  Implement plotting or visualization to track the agent's performance (e.g., cumulative rewards per episode).
5. **Testing and Refinement:**  Evaluate the agent's performance on unseen game instances. Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor) to improve learning.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be tricky. Careful consideration is needed to avoid unintended consequences.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm might require experimentation.  A systematic approach (e.g., grid search or random search) is recommended.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of Reinforcement Learning concepts (e.g., Q-learning, exploration-exploitation trade-off).
- Experience with designing and implementing a simple game environment.
- Hands-on practice with RL libraries (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) and their APIs.
