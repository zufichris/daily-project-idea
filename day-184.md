# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implementing a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it. The goal is to create a functional prototype showcasing RL principles within a constrained timeframe.  The mini-game's simplicity allows for rapid development and experimentation with different RL algorithms. This provides a hands-on experience with applying AI to game playing.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning)
* **Tools:**  A Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Engine:**  A simple 2D game (e.g., a single-screen maze navigation game).
- **RL Agent:** An agent that learns to navigate the maze and reach a goal using a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
- **Reward System:**  A clear reward structure defining positive reinforcement for reaching the goal and penalties for hitting obstacles.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the agent's actions and learning progress within the game environment.
- **Training Loop:**  A mechanism to train the agent iteratively, improving its performance over time.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network â€“ DQN) if time permits.  Integration of a simple GUI for parameter tuning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Design and implement the basic game using Pygame. This should include the game's visual elements, rules, and a simple reward system.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point) and implement the agent's logic to interact with the game environment.
3. **Training Loop Design:** Create a training loop that allows the agent to repeatedly play the game, learn from its experiences, and update its policy accordingly.
4. **Visualization & Evaluation:** Integrate visualization to display the agent's progress and performance metrics (e.g., number of steps to reach the goal).
5. **Refinement and Testing:** Test the agent's performance and adjust parameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) to optimize its learning process.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing the appropriate RL algorithm and tuning its hyperparameters can be challenging.  Start with a simpler algorithm like Q-learning.
- **Reward Shaping:**  Designing an effective reward system that guides the agent's learning efficiently is crucial.  Poor reward design can lead to suboptimal performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:**  This project provides practical experience with core concepts of RL, including state-action spaces, reward functions, and policy updates.
- **Game AI Development:**  Participants will gain experience in integrating AI agents into game environments and observing their learning behavior.
