# Self-Balancing Robot Arm using PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a miniature self-balancing robotic arm using a Raspberry Pi and a simple servo motor setup.  The arm will be designed to maintain a stable upright position, demonstrating the application of PID control for maintaining equilibrium.  This project is significant because it provides a practical application of control systems theory in a tangible robotic system.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), Servo Motor (high torque recommended), Breadboard, Jumper Wires, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit - e.g., MPU6050), Power Supply.
- **Software:** Python 3, RPi.GPIO library, a suitable IMU library (e.g., for MPU6050).


## Features & Requirements
- **Self-Balancing:** The arm must maintain an upright position despite external disturbances.
- **Angle Measurement:** The IMU accurately measures the arm's angle and transmits data to the Raspberry Pi.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  A PID controller algorithm regulates the servo motor to correct for deviations from the upright position.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system displays the current angle and corrective actions on the Raspberry Pi's console.
- **Calibration Routine:** A simple calibration routine to account for initial offsets in the IMU.


- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a simple user interface (e.g., using a button or keyboard) to allow controlled tilting of the arm within a limited range.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a small object (weight) to the arm's end effector and observe how the PID controller adjusts.



## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU, servo motor, and power supply to the Raspberry Pi. Ensure all connections are secure and powered correctly.
2. **Sensor Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Write Python code to read sensor data from the IMU.  Implement a calibration routine to zero the IMU readings.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Develop the PID control algorithm.  Start with simple proportional control and progressively incorporate integral and derivative terms.
4. **Servo Control:** Write the code to control the servo motor based on the PID controller’s output.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the system, observing its response to disturbances. Adjust the PID controller’s gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) iteratively to achieve optimal stability.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **IMU Noise:** IMU readings can be noisy, requiring appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) to smooth the data.
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging.  Systematic tuning methods (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method) may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID Control:** This project provides practical experience in implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental control system algorithm.
- **Embedded Systems Development:**  The project strengthens skills in interfacing hardware (IMU, servo) with a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi) for real-time control applications.
