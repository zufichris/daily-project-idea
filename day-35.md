# Mini-Max Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Visualization

## Overview

This project involves creating a Tic-Tac-Toe AI agent that employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal gameplay, alongside a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization and user interaction.  The focus is on efficient implementation and clean code within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental AI concept in a concise, easily understandable project.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **GUI Library:** Pygame (or similar lightweight library like Tkinter for a simpler GUI)
* **IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm (or any preferred IDE)

## Features & Requirements

- **Minimax AI:**  Implement a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the optimal move for the AI.
- **GUI:** Create a simple visual representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- **User Interaction:** Allow a human player to play against the AI.
- **Win/Loss/Draw Detection:**  Accurately detect win, loss, and draw conditions.
- **Game Reset:** Implement a button or function to reset the game.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Implement a difficulty setting (e.g., depth of the Minimax search tree) to adjust AI strength.
- **Optional Feature:**  Add a visual representation of the AI's decision-making process (e.g., highlighting evaluated board states).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install Pygame (or chosen GUI library) and create a project folder.
2. **Create the Game Board:** Design the visual representation of the board using the chosen GUI library. Implement basic drawing functions for X and O.
3. **Implement Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:**  Write the core AI logic using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient search.
4. **Integrate AI with GUI:** Connect the AI to the GUI, allowing the AI to make moves and update the visual board.  Handle user input and game state updates.
5. **Add Win/Loss/Draw Detection and Reset Functionality:**  Complete the game logic by implementing win/loss/draw conditions and a reset button.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Efficient Minimax Implementation:**  The efficiency of the Minimax algorithm is crucial, especially with alpha-beta pruning, to ensure the AI responds quickly.  Careful coding and optimization are necessary.
- **GUI Responsiveness:** Balancing GUI responsiveness with AI processing time might be challenging.  Consider using threading or asynchronous operations if needed for smoother gameplay.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of AI Algorithms:** This project will solidify understanding of the Minimax algorithm and its optimization through alpha-beta pruning.
- **Practical GUI Development:**  The project provides hands-on experience in building a functional GUI using a chosen library, integrating it with game logic.
