# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic mini-game using reinforcement learning.  We'll focus on a game with a defined state space and relatively simple rules, allowing for a prototype to be built and tested within a day or two. The significance lies in understanding and applying RL principles in a practical setting.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 or similar
* **Game Engine (Optional):** Pygame (for visualization, not strictly required for core functionality)
* **IDE:** VS Code, PyCharm, or similar


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Gameplay:** Implement a simple game like a single-player maze navigation or a simplified version of Breakout.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Train an agent using a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network, Proximal Policy Optimization).
- **Reward System:** Define a clear reward function guiding the agent towards optimal performance.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Implement a training loop and evaluation metrics to track progress.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log training data for analysis and future improvements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Setup:** Define the game state, actions, and reward function. This can be a text-based representation initially, skipping graphical components for speed.
2. **Agent Selection & Initialization:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., DQN) from a library like Stable Baselines3 and initialize the agent with appropriate hyperparameters.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that iteratively interacts with the environment, collects experience, and updates the agent's policy.
4. **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the agent's performance using metrics like average reward or success rate.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If time permits, integrate a simple visualization using Pygame to observe the agent's behavior.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can be time-consuming.  Start with default values and iteratively adjust based on initial results.
- **Reward Function Design:** Designing a reward function that effectively guides the agent towards the desired behavior is crucial.  Careful consideration and iteration might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with RL concepts like state, action, reward, and policy.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:** Develop proficiency in using RL libraries like Stable Baselines3 for building and training agents.
