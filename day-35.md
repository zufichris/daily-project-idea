# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus is on creating a functional prototype showcasing core RL concepts within a limited timeframe. The significance lies in understanding and applying RL algorithms practically, observing learning progress, and experimenting with different RL approaches.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, if not creating a custom one), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL model building), NumPy (for numerical computations).

## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional implementation of the chosen game (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) with clear win/loss/draw conditions.
- **RL Agent:** An agent capable of learning optimal strategies through reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).
- **Training Loop:** A training process that allows the agent to play numerous games against itself, improving its policy over time.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Metrics to track the agent's win rate and learning progress.
- **Visualization (Optional):** A basic visualization of the game state and the agent's decision-making process.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implementing an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
- **Advanced Feature:** Comparing the performance of different RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning vs SARSA).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment (game rules, state representation, reward function).  If using OpenAI Gym, leverage existing environments; otherwise, create a custom environment.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement the chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity). Initialize the Q-table or neural network.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a loop that allows the agent to play multiple games against itself, updating its Q-values or neural network weights based on the received rewards.
4. **Evaluation:**  After training, evaluate the agent's performance against a random or human opponent.  Track win rate and learning curve.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Implement basic visualization to observe the game and agent's choices.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal play is crucial.  A poorly designed reward function might lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance:**  Finding the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions is critical for efficient learning.  This often requires tuning hyperparameters like epsilon in epsilon-greedy strategies.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project provides hands-on experience with core RL concepts like state, action, reward, and policy.
- **Practical Application of RL Algorithms:**  Participants gain experience implementing and applying a specific RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to a concrete problem.
