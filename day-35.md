# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus is on rapid prototyping and experimentation with different RL algorithms within a constrained timeframe. The significance lies in demonstrating the core concepts of RL in a practical and easily understandable context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenAI Gym (for environment creation if needed), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL algorithm implementation)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -   A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -   An RL agent capable of learning through self-play.
    -   Basic training and evaluation loops.
    -   Visualization of the agent's performance (win rate, average game length).
    -   Ability to save and load the trained agent's model.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -   Implementation of a more advanced RL algorithm (e.g., Double Q-Learning or Policy Gradient methods beyond Q-Learning).
    -   Exploration vs. Exploitation strategy tuning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game rules and create the game environment. This can be a simple class or use a pre-built Gym environment if available.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-Learning) and implement the agent's logic.  Focus on a simple implementation first.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that allows the agent to play against itself and update its policy based on the results.
4. **Evaluation:**  Create an evaluation function to assess the agent's performance after training.
5. **Visualization & Saving:** Visualize the training progress and save the trained agent's model.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:** Training RL agents can be computationally expensive.  Simplifying the game environment and the RL algorithm can mitigate this.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) might require experimentation and could consume significant time.  Prioritize a functional implementation over exhaustive tuning.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (state, action, reward, policy).
- Practical experience with implementing and evaluating RL algorithms.
