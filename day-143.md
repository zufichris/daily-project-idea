# Optimized Image Compression for Embedded Systems

## Overview

This project aims to develop a small, efficient image compression module optimized for resource-constrained embedded systems like microcontrollers.  The focus will be on achieving high compression ratios while maintaining acceptable image quality and minimizing processing time, suitable for applications such as real-time image transmission in robotics or IoT devices.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** C++ (for speed and efficiency)
* **Libraries:**  A lightweight image processing library like stb_image (for loading/saving images) and a compression library like zlib or a custom implementation of a simple lossy compression algorithm.
* **Tools:**  A microcontroller simulator (e.g.,  Arduino IDE or a dedicated simulator for the target microcontroller) or an actual microcontroller development board.  A text editor or IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Image Loading & Saving:** Load an image from a file, process it, and save the compressed image to a file.
- **Compression Algorithm:** Implement a simple yet effective lossy compression algorithm (e.g., a modified quantization scheme or a simplified version of JPEG).
- **Compression Ratio Measurement:** Calculate the compression ratio achieved.
- **Image Quality Assessment:**  Implement a rudimentary quality metric (e.g., PSNR or SSIM, simplified versions).
- **Size Optimization:** The resulting code should be small enough to fit in the constrained memory of an embedded system.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Add support for different image formats (e.g.,  grayscale, RGB).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a configurable compression level allowing a trade-off between compression ratio and speed.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and tools, choose the target microcontroller or simulator.
2. **Image I/O:** Implement the image loading and saving functionality using the chosen library.
3. **Compression Algorithm:** Implement a basic lossy compression algorithm (e.g., quantization-based).
4. **Compression Ratio & Quality Assessment:** Implement functions to calculate the compression ratio and a basic quality metric.
5. **Test and Optimize:** Test with various images, measure performance, and optimize the code for size and speed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Balancing Compression Ratio and Image Quality:** Finding an optimal balance between compression efficiency and acceptable image quality requires experimentation and adjustment of algorithm parameters.
- **Memory Constraints:**  The code must be highly optimized to fit within the limited memory of an embedded system. This might require careful memory management and the use of efficient data structures.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:** Reinforces understanding of memory management and optimization techniques critical for embedded systems development.
- **Image Processing & Compression:**  Provides hands-on experience with image compression algorithms and their implementation, emphasizing efficiency and resource constraints.
