# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home device control system using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will interpret specific gestures from a webcam feed to control predefined smart home functions, offering a hands-free and intuitive interaction method. This is significant as it explores a novel interaction paradigm, moving beyond traditional voice or app-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking),  `requests` (for HTTP communication with smart home devices)
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a personal computer (preferably with a decent GPU), a smart home device (e.g., a smart light bulb or a smart plug with an API).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:** The system should accurately detect and classify predefined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for "on," closed fist for "off," thumb up for "brightness up").
- **Smart Home Device Integration:** The system must seamlessly integrate with at least one smart home device via its API, allowing for control through recognised gestures.
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple visualization showing the detected gestures and the current state of the controlled device is desirable.
- **Calibration:** Option for users to calibrate their gesture recognition based on their individual hand size and movements.
- **Error Handling:** The system should handle cases where gestures are not clearly recognized.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Integration with multiple smart home devices (e.g., lights, thermostat).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Implementation of a gesture-based control for volume adjustment on a smart speaker.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, `requests`).
2. **Implement hand gesture recognition:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect and extract hand landmarks from the webcam feed. Train a simple classifier (e.g., using k-nearest neighbors or a simple rule-based system) to map landmarks to predefined gestures.
3. **Integrate with smart home API:**  Utilize the `requests` library to send HTTP commands to the chosen smart home device based on the recognized gesture.
4. **Develop UI:** Create a basic visualization (e.g., using OpenCV's window display) to show the detected gestures and the current state of the controlled device.
5. **Test and refine:** Thoroughly test the system, calibrate gesture recognition as needed, and handle potential errors (e.g., connection issues, recognition failures).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of gesture recognition:**  Variations in lighting, hand positions, and background clutter can impact recognition accuracy.  Addressing this might require more sophisticated gesture recognition techniques or pre-processing steps.
- **API Integration Complexity:** Smart home devices might have different APIs and authentication mechanisms, requiring specific adaptation for each device.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand tracking.
- **Gain experience in API interaction:**  Working with a smart home device API helps to understand and practice interacting with external services.
