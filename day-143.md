# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent capable of playing a basic game using reinforcement learning techniques.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and iterative improvement, making it suitable for a 1-2 day challenge. The game's simplicity allows for exploration of core RL concepts without extensive setup.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple, well-defined game environment (e.g., a grid-based game like a simplified Pac-Man or a custom 2D maze navigation).
    - An RL agent trained using Q-learning or a similar algorithm.
    - Visualization of the agent's actions and learning progress.
    - Basic reward system to guide the agent's learning.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Exploration vs. Exploitation techniques (Îµ-greedy or softmax).
    - Simple model persistence (saving the trained agent's parameters).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Design:** Define the game's rules, state space, action space, and reward function. Create a simple environment using a library like Gym or build a custom one.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity) and implement the agent's logic in Python, using PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras for numerical computation.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop to iterate through game episodes, update the agent's policy based on the received rewards, and visualize the learning progress.
4. **Testing and Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance after training.  Measure metrics like average reward per episode or successful completion rate.
5. **Refinement:** Based on evaluation results, refine the agent's hyperparameters, reward function, or even the RL algorithm itself for improved performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can hinder the agent's learning. Careful consideration is needed to ensure it effectively guides the agent towards desired behavior.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) can require experimentation and may influence the success of the project.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Understanding the key concepts of RL, including state, action, reward, and policy.
- Building and evaluating an AI agent, gaining insights into the process of training and testing intelligent systems.
