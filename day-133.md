# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic real-time object detection and tracking system using a client-server architecture with WebRTC for video streaming.  The server will process the video stream, detect objects (e.g., people, cars), and send tracking data back to the client for visualization.  This is significant as it demonstrates a foundational application of computer vision and real-time communication, applicable in various fields like surveillance, robotics, and augmented reality.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages:** Python (server-side), JavaScript (client-side)
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** OpenCV (Python), TensorFlow Lite (Python, potentially), WebRTC (JavaScript), Socket.IO (optional, for enhanced communication)
- **Tools:**  A webcam or video source, a development environment (VS Code, PyCharm), Node.js (if using Socket.IO).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  The client should stream video to the server using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** The server should detect a pre-defined set of objects (e.g., people) in the video stream using a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet SSD).
- **Object Tracking:**  The server should track detected objects across frames, providing bounding boxes and potentially IDs.
- **Client-side Visualization:** The client should display the video stream with overlaid bounding boxes indicating detected and tracked objects.
- **Basic Data Logging (Optional):**  Log detection and tracking data to a file for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up WebRTC streaming:**  Implement the client-side WebRTC code to capture video from a webcam and stream it to a server.
2. **Develop the server-side object detection:** Implement the server-side using Python and OpenCV (and optionally TensorFlow Lite for a more sophisticated model) to receive the video stream, perform object detection, and track objects.
3. **Integrate tracking and data transmission:**  Combine object detection and tracking algorithms; send tracking data back to the client via WebRTC's data channel (or Socket.IO).
4. **Implement client-side visualization:** Display the streamed video and overlay bounding boxes from the tracking data received from the server.
5. **(Optional) Add data logging:** Implement server-side logging to record object detection and tracking data.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Latency:** Minimizing latency between video capture, processing, and visualization is crucial for real-time performance. Optimizing the video stream resolution and the object detection model's computational complexity can mitigate this.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate pre-trained object detection model that balances accuracy and processing speed is vital.  A lightweight model like MobileNet SSD is recommended for this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time video processing:** Gain practical experience in handling and processing video streams in real-time.
- **Integration of computer vision and communication:**  Understand how to integrate computer vision techniques (object detection, tracking) with real-time communication technologies (WebRTC).
