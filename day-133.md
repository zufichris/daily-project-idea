# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up/down, wave) to control specific smart home devices (simulated in this case). This project focuses on demonstrating the feasibility and speed of implementing a basic yet functional gesture recognition system.  The significance lies in exploring the accessibility and convenience of hands-free control.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  simple-websocket-server (optional for communication with simulated devices).
* **Hardware:** Webcam (any standard webcam will suffice).
* **Tools:**  Visual Studio Code or similar IDE.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Capture and display the webcam feed.
- **Hand Detection & Tracking:**  Accurately locate and track the user's hands in the video stream.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize pre-defined simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up for "increase volume," thumbs down for "decrease volume", wave for "turn off lights").
- **Smart Home Device Control (Simulated):**  Implement simulated device control based on recognized gestures (e.g., print commands to the console to represent device actions).
- **GUI:** Basic interface to display the recognized gesture and device status.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a simple model training process to allow user customization of gestures.
- **Optional Feature:**  Integrate with a real smart home platform (like Home Assistant via websockets) for actual device control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment and Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, simple-websocket-server [optional]).
2. **Webcam Feed & Hand Tracking:**  Implement code to capture the webcam feed and use MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks.
3. **Gesture Recognition Logic:** Develop the logic to classify detected hand landmarks into predefined gestures (e.g., using simple distance calculations or angle comparisons between landmarks).
4. **Simulated Device Control:** Create functions to simulate device control actions based on the recognized gestures and print corresponding messages to the console.
5. **GUI Integration (Optional):** Create a simple graphical user interface (using Tkinter or similar) to display the webcam feed and the recognized gesture and device status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Performance:** Processing speed might be a challenge. Optimize code and potentially reduce resolution for better performance.
- **Gesture Variability:**  Hand gestures can vary significantly between users.  Robustness to these variations should be addressed with thorough testing.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of computer vision:**  Gain hands-on experience with using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time video processing and gesture recognition.
- **Real-time system design:** Understand the challenges and techniques involved in building a system that responds to input with minimal delay.
