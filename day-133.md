# Robotic Arm Precision Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple computer vision system to calibrate the end-effector position of a robotic arm.  Accurate positioning is crucial for many robotic tasks, and this project aims to improve precision through image-based feedback, offering a tangible improvement over relying solely on internal sensors. This can be adapted to many robot arms, and even simulated ones.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, specific manufacturer's SDK - depending on the hardware).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simulated one in a Gazebo/V-REP environment), a camera (web camera sufficient for prototyping), a calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard).

## Features & Requirements
- **Image Acquisition:** Capture images from the camera.
- **Target Detection:** Detect and locate the calibration target in the image using OpenCV's corner detection.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Calculate the transformation matrix between the camera and the robot arm's coordinate system.
- **Position Correction:** Apply the transformation to correct the robot arm's end-effector position based on the detected target location.
- **Error Reporting:** Provide feedback on the calibration accuracy.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement iterative refinement of the calibration using multiple image samples.
- **Optional Feature:** Integrate with a user interface for easy parameter adjustment and visualization.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Calibration Target:** Set up the camera and robotic arm, ensuring they have a clear view of the calibration target.
2. **Image Processing and Feature Detection:** Use OpenCV to capture images and detect the calibration target's corners.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Compute the transformation matrix using techniques like perspective-n-point (PnP) or similar algorithms provided by OpenCV.
4. **Robot Arm Control:** Use the calculated transformation to correct the robot arm's position. Move the arm to a known location, capture an image, and compare the detected target position with the expected position.
5. **Iterative Refinement (Optional):** Repeat steps 2-4 multiple times to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Camera Calibration:**  Accurately calibrating the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, distortion coefficients) is crucial for precise coordinate transformation.  Pre-calibrated cameras simplify this.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Changes in lighting can affect target detection.  A controlled environment is beneficial for initial prototyping.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of image processing, feature detection, and coordinate transformations.
- **Robotics Integration:** It provides practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic control systems for improved accuracy and precision.
