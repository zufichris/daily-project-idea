# Automated Code Style Enforcer with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to build a command-line tool that automatically enforces a customizable coding style guide on Python code.  The tool will read a configuration file defining style rules and then analyze and modify Python files to adhere to those rules. This is significant because consistent code style improves readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.  A daily challenge will focus on a core subset of rules, leaving expansion for future work.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees), `argparse` (command-line argument parsing), `toml` (configuration file parsing), `difflib` (for generating diffs)


## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:**  The tool will read a TOML configuration file specifying style rules (e.g., maximum line length, indentation style, spacing around operators).
- **Code Analysis:**  It will parse Python code using the `ast` module to identify style violations.
- **Automatic Formatting:** The tool will automatically reformat code to fix identified violations based on the defined rules.
- **Command-Line Interface:** A user-friendly command-line interface allowing users to specify the configuration file and target files/directories.
- **Report Generation:** A summary report showing the number of violations found and fixed.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a version control system (e.g., Git) to automatically stage changes. Support for additional programming languages (e.g., JavaScript).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Configuration Parsing:** Implement the TOML configuration file parser to read rules (e.g., `max_line_length = 79`, `indent_style = "spaces"`).
2. **AST-based Analysis:**  Develop functions that traverse the AST and identify violations based on the loaded rules.
3. **Code Transformation:** Implement functions to modify the AST to correct identified violations (e.g., changing indentation, splitting long lines).
4. **Code Generation:**  Implement functions that generate updated Python code from the modified AST.  Use `difflib` to create informative diffs.
5. **CLI Implementation:** Use `argparse` to create a simple command-line interface to control the tool.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Complex AST Structures:**  Dealing with complex code structures (nested functions, classes, etc.) within the AST can be challenging.  Focus on handling a limited set of simple structures initially.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling (e.g., gracefully handling invalid configuration files, malformed code) is critical.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs):**  Working directly with ASTs provides deep insight into program structure and enables powerful code manipulation.
- **Improve command-line tool development skills:**  Building a practical command-line tool with proper argument parsing and configuration management.
