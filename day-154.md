# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, real-time hand gesture recognition system using a webcam as input, focusing on micro-gestures (small, precise movements) for controlling smart home devices. The significance lies in exploring efficient, low-resource gesture recognition suitable for embedded systems or resource-constrained environments, ultimately paving the way for more intuitive and accessible smart home interfaces.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (Hands), NumPy
- **Tools:** Webcam, IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  Accurately identify predefined micro-gestures (e.g., thumb up/down, finger count 1-3) from webcam feed.
- **Confidence Thresholding:**  Reject ambiguous gestures based on a configurable confidence level.
- **Smart Home Integration (Simulated):**  Map detected gestures to simulated smart home actions (e.g., thumb up = increase lights, finger count 2 = adjust volume).
- **GUI for Visualization:**  Display the webcam feed, detected gestures, and confidence scores.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Save gesture data for later analysis and model improvement.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Integration with a real smart home API (requires API key and setup).
- **Advanced Feature:**  Implementation of a simple machine learning model for improved gesture recognition accuracy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy).
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition using MediaPipe Hands.  Focus on a small set of predefined gestures.
3. **Action Mapping:**  Create a mapping between detected gestures and simulated smart home commands (print statements initially).
4. **GUI Development:**  Create a simple GUI using a library like Tkinter to display the webcam feed, recognized gestures, and confidence scores.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Test the system with various hand gestures and lighting conditions. Adjust confidence thresholds and improve gesture recognition accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to Noise:**  Handling variations in lighting, hand position, and background clutter. Implementing appropriate image preprocessing techniques (e.g., background subtraction) will be crucial.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and processing speed to ensure smooth real-time operation.  Optimizing code and potentially reducing the image resolution may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Software Design & Implementation:** Building a functional system with a clear structure, modular design, and error handling.
