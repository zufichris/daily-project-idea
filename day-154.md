# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling smart home devices using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model.  The goal is to create a responsive and intuitive system that can be controlled without needing a physical interface, enhancing accessibility and user experience.  This daily challenge focuses on a simplified, yet functional prototype.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation),  a relevant smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Hardware:** A webcam (integrated or external), a computer capable of running Python and the required libraries.  Optional:  A Raspberry Pi for deployment.
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately recognize a predefined set of hand gestures (e.g., wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for volume increase, thumbs down for volume decrease).
- **Smart Home Device Integration:** The system needs to interface with at least one smart home device (e.g., smart light bulb) and execute commands based on the recognized gesture.
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple visualization of the detected gesture and the corresponding command should be displayed on the screen.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of cases where gestures are not recognized or commands fail.
- **Calibration:**  Simple calibration steps to adapt to varying lighting conditions and user hand sizes.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Device Control:** Expand to control multiple smart home devices simultaneously with different gestures.
- **Gesture Training:**  Allow for adding custom gestures through a simple training process.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, and the chosen smart home API library).
2. **Gesture Recognition Model:** Implement a gesture recognition pipeline using MediaPipe's pose estimation model to detect hand landmarks and classify them into predefined gestures.  Focus on a small set of simple gestures for this daily challenge.
3. **Smart Home Integration:**  Integrate with the chosen smart home API to send commands to the smart device based on recognized gestures.
4. **UI Development:** Create a simple UI using libraries like OpenCV's `imshow` function or a minimal GUI framework to display gesture recognition results and device status.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and users, refining the gesture recognition model and calibration as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in hand size, lighting, and background clutter can impact recognition accuracy.  Focus on robust features for reliable detection.
- **API Integration:**  Each smart home API will have its unique quirks and authentication requirements.  Careful review of the API documentation is crucial.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of Computer Vision:** Gain experience in using computer vision techniques for real-world applications.
- **API Integration:**  Master the process of integrating a software solution with a third-party API.
