# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Embedded System Notification

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system that detects and tracks a specific object (e.g., a person, a specific color) in real-time using a Raspberry Pi and a USB camera.  The system will then send a notification (e.g., email, SMS) to a specified recipient when the object enters or leaves a predefined region of interest (ROI) within the camera's view. This is a practical application of computer vision and embedded systems, useful for security, monitoring, or automation tasks.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for object detection), RPi.GPIO (for optional hardware interaction), smtplib (for email notifications), a suitable SMS gateway library.
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB camera, potentially a buzzer or LED for local notification (optional).
* **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., Thonny, VS Code), Git for version control.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system accurately detects the target object in live video feed from the camera.
- **Object Tracking:** The system tracks the detected object's movement within the frame.
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Definition:** Users can define a rectangular ROI on the camera feed where object presence/absence triggers notifications.
- **Notification System:** Upon object entering or exiting the ROI, the system sends a notification (e.g., email).
- **Visual Feedback:**  The system displays the detected object and the ROI on the camera feed.


- **Advanced Features:**  Integration with a cloud platform for remote monitoring and data logging.
- **Advanced Features:** Implementing different notification methods (SMS, push notifications).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Object Detection Model Loading:** Set up the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries, and load a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite object detection model (consider MobileNet SSD).
2. **Real-time Video Processing and ROI Definition:**  Use OpenCV to capture video from the camera, display it, and allow the user to define the ROI using the mouse.
3. **Object Tracking and Notification Logic:** Implement object tracking within the ROI, triggering notification (e.g., sending an email) based on object presence/absence.
4. **GUI Development (Optional):** Create a simple GUI (using Tkinter or PyQt) to simplify ROI definition and parameter adjustments.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with different lighting conditions and object positions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Resources:**  Balancing real-time processing with the computational limitations of the Raspberry Pi.  Consider optimizing the object detection model and processing pipeline for speed.
- **Accuracy of Object Detection:** Dealing with potential inaccuracies in object detection under varying lighting and conditions; explore techniques for improving robustness.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision Concepts:**  Practical application of object detection, tracking, and image processing techniques.
- **Embedded Systems Development:**  Experience with integrating software and hardware components for a real-time application on a resource-constrained platform.
