# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simplified self-balancing robot arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller. The goal is to implement a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain the arm's balance when perturbed.  This provides a practical application of control systems theory within a tangible robotic system, achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 for more advanced features).
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Sensor:** MPU6050 6-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit).
* **Actuator:** Servo motor (SG90 or similar).
* **Power Supply:** 5V power supply.
* **Software Libraries:**  Wire.h (for I2C communication with IMU). Servo.h (for servo motor control).

## Features & Requirements
- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain an upright position when subjected to small disturbances (e.g., a gentle push).
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to regulate the servo motor's position based on IMU feedback.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The arm's angle should be displayed on a serial monitor.
- **Calibration Routine:**  A simple calibration routine to adjust the zero-point of the IMU.
- **Stability under Disturbances:** The arm should exhibit good stability and quickly recover from external disturbances.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Automatic Leveling:**  The arm automatically levels itself to a vertical position upon startup.
- **Visual Feedback (optional):** Integration with a simple display (e.g., LCD screen) for visual feedback on the angle and PID values.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU, servo motor, and power supply to the microcontroller.
2. **IMU Calibration and Data Acquisition:** Write code to read and calibrate the IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope readings).  Implement complementary filter or Kalman filter for accurate angle estimation.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller algorithm to adjust the servo motor's angle based on the calculated angle error. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) for optimal performance.
4. **Servo Control:** Integrate the PID output with the servo motor control to drive the servo based on the control signal.
5. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the system's stability and tune the PID gains iteratively for optimal performance by introducing controlled disturbances.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and require iterative adjustments. Start with conservative values and gradually increase them.
- **IMU Noise:** IMU readings are noisy; using filtering techniques (complementary filter, Kalman filter) will greatly improve accuracy and stability.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing PID controllers for real-world applications.
- **Embedded Systems Development:**  Enhance skills in programming microcontrollers, using sensor data, and interfacing with actuators.
