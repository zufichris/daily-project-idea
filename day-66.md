# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple computer vision system to calibrate a robotic arm's end-effector position.  The goal is to accurately determine the arm's position in 3D space using a camera and image processing techniques, improving its precision without relying solely on internal sensors which can drift over time.  This is significant because accurate calibration is crucial for many robotic applications, especially those requiring precise manipulation or assembly.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, potentially a robotic arm SDK (depending on the arm used, e.g., ROS for more advanced arms)
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, low-cost one will suffice), a webcam or other camera, a checkerboard or known-shape calibration target.

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, distortion coefficients).
- **Target Detection:** Detect and locate the calibration target in the camera's image.
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the target relative to the camera.
- **Arm Position Mapping:** Correlate the target's pose with the robot arm's joint angles.
- **Calibration Adjustment:**  Implement a simple adjustment mechanism (e.g., modifying a configuration file) to correct the arm's position based on the detected discrepancy.

**Advanced Features:**
- Real-time feedback and adjustment: Continuously monitor and adjust arm position.
- Error compensation: Develop a model to compensate for systematic errors in the arm's movement.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's functions to calibrate the camera using images of the checkerboard from different angles.
2. **Target Detection & Pose Estimation:**  Detect the checkerboard in each image and use OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to calculate its pose.
3. **Robot Arm Control & Data Acquisition:** Move the robotic arm to several known positions, capturing images at each position. Record the corresponding joint angles for each position.
4. **Position Mapping:** Use the camera pose estimates and corresponding robot arm joint angles to create a mapping between camera coordinates and robot arm coordinates.  A simple linear model might suffice for a small, constrained workspace.
5. **Calibration Adjustment:** Implement a mechanism (e.g., adjusting a transformation matrix) to correct the robot arm's reported position based on the differences observed between the camera-estimated pose and the commanded arm pose.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy will depend on the quality of the camera, the lighting conditions, and the precision of the robotic arm.  Small errors in camera calibration or target detection can significantly impact the results.
- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing might require optimization techniques if using a more sophisticated robot arm or more complex algorithms.  Start with a simplified approach that can be processed quickly to verify the concept.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Reinforce understanding of camera calibration, feature detection, and pose estimation.
- **Robotic Control Integration:** Gain experience integrating computer vision techniques with robotic control systems, understanding the challenges of real-world sensor data and applying corrections.
