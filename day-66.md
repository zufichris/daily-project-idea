# Automated Code Style Enforcement Bot

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple chatbot that automatically enforces a specific code style guide within a given codebase. The bot will analyze code snippets, identify style violations against a predefined rule set, and provide suggestions for correction. This is significant as consistent code style enhances readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.  The focus will be on a specific language like Python or Javascript, for a feasible daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries below) or Javascript (with similar libraries).
- **Libraries:** `pylint` (Python) or `ESLint` (Javascript) for static code analysis.
- **Framework:** A simple chatbot framework like `dialogflow` or a custom implementation using a library like `Flask` (Python) or `Express.js` (Javascript) for the bot interface.
- **Tools:**  Version control system (Git), IDE or text editor.


## Features & Requirements

- **Code Style Analysis:**  Analyzes code snippets provided by the user for adherence to a specified style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb for Javascript).
- **Violation Reporting:** Reports the number and types of style violations found.
- **Suggestion Generation:** Provides specific suggestions to correct identified violations.
- **Code Snippet Input:** Accepts code snippets as input through a chatbot interface.
- **Output Formatting:** Presents the results in a clear and understandable format (e.g., JSON or a formatted text message).

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Integrate with a code repository (like GitHub) to analyze entire files or projects.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement automatic code correction (with user confirmation).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment & Libraries:** Install necessary libraries (`pylint`, `Flask`, etc.) and set up a development environment. Choose a style guide.
2. **Develop Code Analysis Module:** Create a function that uses the chosen static analysis tool to analyze code snippets and extract violation information.
3. **Build Chatbot Interface:** Implement the chatbot interface using the chosen framework to receive code snippets and send results.
4. **Integrate Analysis & Interface:** Combine the code analysis module with the chatbot interface to create the complete functionality.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test thoroughly with various code examples and refine the output format for clarity.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Different Code Styles:** Adapting the bot to support multiple style guides might be challenging, needing configurations or plugins.
- **False Positives:**  Static analysis tools can sometimes report false positives; handling these gracefully is important.  Prioritize clear reporting and user interaction to address this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Static Code Analysis:** Understanding and using static analysis tools for code quality improvement.
- **Chatbot Development:** Gaining experience in creating simple chatbots using a suitable framework.  This includes user interface design, input/output processing, and integration with external libraries.
