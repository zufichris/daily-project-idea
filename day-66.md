# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system that uses a camera to track a specific object in real-time and then commands a robotic arm to follow its movement.  The goal is to create a basic but functional prototype demonstrating the integration of computer vision and robotics within a short timeframe. This is significant because it showcases core skills in several areas while remaining achievable within a limited time constraint.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a suitable robotic arm control library (e.g., `pySerial` if using an Arduino-based controller, or a vendor-specific library), TensorFlow Lite/PyTorch (optional, for faster on-device classification).
* **Hardware:** A webcam, a robotic arm (preferably with a simple API), and a computer with sufficient processing power.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** The system must accurately detect and locate a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:**  The system must continuously track the object's position as it moves.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** The system must send commands to the robotic arm to adjust its position and maintain alignment with the tracked object.
- **Visual Feedback:** The system should display the tracked object overlaid on the camera feed.
- **Calibration:**  The system needs basic calibration to map camera coordinates to robotic arm coordinates.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Object classification (distinguish between multiple objects) and predictive tracking (anticipate object movement).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Object Detection & Tracking Setup:** Implement object detection using OpenCV.  Focus on a simple color-based approach or use a pre-trained model for speed.  Integrate tracking using optical flow or similar techniques.
2. **Robotic Arm Integration:**  Connect to the robotic arm and send basic positional commands (e.g., using joint angles or Cartesian coordinates). Test basic movement and calibration.
3. **Coordinate Mapping:** Establish a mapping between the camera's coordinate system and the robotic arm's coordinate system. This might involve manual calibration or a simple transformation.
4. **Integration & Control Loop:** Combine the object tracking and robotic arm control. Create a control loop that continuously updates the arm's position based on the tracked object's location.
5. **Visual Feedback:** Overlay tracking information and robotic arm status on the camera feed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Calibration Accuracy:** Achieving accurate mapping between the camera and robot arm requires careful calibration, and this might be time-consuming.  Simplifying the calibration process is key to success within the time constraints.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing speed is crucial for real-time performance.  Consider optimizing code and using efficient algorithms.  Using a simplified object detection approach can greatly reduce computational overhead.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Integration of Computer Vision and Robotics:** This project reinforces skills in combining computer vision algorithms with robotic control systems.
- **Real-time System Design:**  The project emphasizes the importance of efficient code, optimization, and real-time constraints when dealing with dynamic systems.
