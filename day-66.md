#  Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and readily available computer vision libraries.  The goal is to detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view and classify it. This demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts and provides a foundation for more complex robotics projects.

## Technologies & Tools
- Raspberry Pi (with camera module)
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- TensorFlow Lite (optional, for more advanced classification)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time video capture:** Capture video from the Raspberry Pi camera.
- **Object detection:** Detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) using color thresholding.
- **Object tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames using OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter or simple centroid tracking).
- **Position reporting:** Output the object's (x, y) coordinates in real-time.
- **Basic visualization:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes around the tracked object.

- **Advanced Classification (Optional):** Integrate TensorFlow Lite for object classification beyond simple color thresholding (e.g., distinguishing between different colored balls).
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Log the object's position data to a file for later analysis.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow Lite (optional)) on the Raspberry Pi. Configure the camera module.
2. **Video capture and color thresholding:** Write code to capture video from the camera and apply color thresholding to isolate the target object.  This might involve adjusting HSV values to define the color range of the object.
3. **Object tracking:** Implement an object tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.  Consider using OpenCV's `cv2.track` functions.
4. **Position reporting and visualization:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes around the tracked object and print the object's coordinates to the console in real-time.
5. **Optional: Classification and Logging:** Integrate TensorFlow Lite for object classification if desired. Implement data logging to save position data.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Lighting conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly affect color thresholding accuracy. Experiment with different thresholding techniques or lighting adjustments.
- **Object occlusion:** If the object is partially or fully obscured, the tracking algorithm might fail.  Robust tracking algorithms are needed to handle such scenarios.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces understanding of real-time image processing techniques.
- Provides practical experience with OpenCV for object detection and tracking.  This also includes experience using tracking algorithms and their limitations.
