# Minimalist AI-Powered Code Summarizer

## Overview

This project aims to build a lightweight, AI-powered tool that summarizes code snippets.  The focus is on speed and efficiency, prioritizing a functional prototype over extensive features.  The significance lies in improving developer productivity by quickly understanding the core logic of code blocks without needing to read every line.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** transformers (Hugging Face), sentence-transformers
* **Framework:** Streamlit (for rapid UI prototyping)
* **Model:** A pre-trained code summarization model from Hugging Face (e.g., CodeT5, BART)


## Features & Requirements

- **Code Input:** Accept code snippets as input (supports multiple languages).
- **Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of the input code.
- **Language Detection:** Automatically detect the programming language of the input.
- **Output Display:**  Present the summary clearly alongside the original code.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Allow users to easily copy the generated summary.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a version control system (e.g., GitHub) to fetch code directly.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Allow users to customize the summary length.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install transformers sentence-transformers streamlit`). Select and download a suitable pre-trained summarization model.
2. **Develop Core Logic:** Create Python functions to handle code input, language detection, model inference, and output formatting. Integrate with Streamlit to build a simple user interface.
3. **Implement Summarization:** Integrate the chosen model to generate summaries. Handle potential errors (e.g., model inference failures).
4. **UI Development:** Create a basic Streamlit app with input fields for code, buttons for summarization and copy, and output areas to display the code and summary.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test with various code snippets in different languages. Refine the UI and summarization logic based on results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Performance:**  Pre-trained models may not perform optimally on all code styles and languages. Experimentation with different models may be required.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is essential to manage potential issues with model inference and invalid code input.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Pre-trained Models:** Gain experience using and integrating pre-trained AI models for a practical task.
- **Rapid Prototyping with Streamlit:** Learn to quickly build and deploy a functional web application using Streamlit.
