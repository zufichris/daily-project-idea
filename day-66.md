# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, game AI using reinforcement learning techniques.  The focus will be on creating a rudimentary AI agent that learns to play a basic game (like Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Connect Four) through trial and error, demonstrating the core principles of reinforcement learning in a short timeframe.  This project emphasizes practical application over complex game logic.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar, like RLlib)
* **Game Engine/Library:** Pygame (for simple visualization, optional but recommended)
* **IDE:** VS Code, PyCharm, or similar

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Implementation:** Create a simple game environment with clear win/loss/draw conditions.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Implement a basic reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning or a simpler algorithm from Stable Baselines3.
- **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop that allows the agent to play many games against itself and learn from the outcomes.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Track and display the agent's win rate over time to monitor learning progress.
- **Basic Visualization (Optional):**  Display the game board and agent moves using Pygame.


- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization â€“ PPO) from Stable Baselines3.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Introduce a slightly more complex game environment with additional game mechanics.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment:** Define the game rules and create a function to represent the game state.  Choose a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Select a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a pre-built agent from Stable Baselines3). Implement the agent to interact with the game environment.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a loop that repeatedly lets the agent play the game, update its policy based on rewards, and tracks performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation:** Visualize or print the agent's win rate over training iterations to demonstrate learning.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** Integrate Pygame to display the game graphically, enhancing the learning experience.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully designing a reward function that appropriately guides the agent's learning is crucial.  An improperly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal behavior.
- **Computational Time:**  Depending on the complexity of the algorithm and the game, training might require some time.  Adjust the training parameters (number of episodes, learning rate) accordingly.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces understanding of reinforcement learning concepts, including state, action, reward, and policy.
- It provides practical experience in implementing and evaluating a simple reinforcement learning agent.
