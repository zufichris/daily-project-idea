#  Miniature Robot Obstacle Avoidance with Real-time Feedback

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet effective obstacle avoidance system for a miniature robot using a single distance sensor and real-time feedback. The goal is to build a robust, functional prototype within a day or two, showcasing fundamental robotics and programming concepts. The significance lies in demonstrating the integration of sensor data with control mechanisms in a constrained timeframe, mimicking real-world robotics challenges.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below)
* **Microcontroller:**  Arduino Nano (or similar)
* **Sensor:** Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04)
* **Actuators:**  Two DC motors with motor driver (e.g., L293D)
* **Libraries:**  `RPi.GPIO` (if using a Raspberry Pi for data visualization; optional)

## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Detection:** The robot accurately detects obstacles within a specified range using the ultrasonic sensor.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot autonomously changes direction upon detecting an obstacle, avoiding collision.
- **Motor Control:**  Precise control of the robot's two motors to enable turning and movement.
- **Real-time Feedback (Basic):** LED indication of obstacle detection (ON/OFF).
- **Basic Movement Control:** The robot moves forward until an obstacle is detected, then rotates to avoid the obstacle.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Data logging and visualization (plotting distance readings over time using a Raspberry Pi and `matplotlib`).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implementing a more sophisticated avoidance algorithm (e.g., incorporating a PID controller for smoother turning).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the ultrasonic sensor, motors, and motor driver to the Arduino.  Ensure proper wiring and power supply.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Test the ultrasonic sensor's accuracy and adjust the detection threshold as needed.
3. **Control Logic:** Write the Arduino code to read sensor data, process it (determine if an obstacle is present), and control the motors accordingly. This involves using conditional statements and motor speed control functions.
4. **Testing and Refinement:** Run the robot in a controlled environment and refine the code based on the observed behavior. Adjust thresholds, motor speeds, and turning angles to optimize performance.
5. **(Optional) Data Visualization:** If using a Raspberry Pi, integrate data logging and visualization to observe the sensor data and motor control actions over time.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:** Ultrasonic sensors can be prone to noise, requiring careful filtering or thresholding techniques to avoid false positives. Using a moving average filter is recommended.
- **Motor Calibration:**  Different motors may have varying speeds and torque, necessitating precise calibration for consistent movement and turning.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Reinforces skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and actuator control.
- **Real-time Control Systems:**  Provides practical experience in designing and implementing a simple feedback control system for a robotic platform.
