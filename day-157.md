# Mini-Project:  Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple system for real-time object detection and tracking using a webcam feed, which can then be used to guide a robotic arm (simulated or physical) to pick up the detected object.  The focus is on a minimal viable product (MVP) demonstrating core functionalities within a short timeframe. This allows for exploring the integration of computer vision and robotics within a constrained scope.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch (Lite version for faster inference), Robot Operating System (ROS) - (Optional, for physical robot interaction)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, (Optional) Robotic arm (e.g., Dobot Magician, UR3e), ROS-compatible computer.
* **Tools:**  Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the webcam feed using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's location across frames using algorithms like Kalman filtering or optical flow.
- **Position Reporting:** Provide real-time coordinates (x, y) of the object's centroid in the image.
- **Robotic Arm Control (Optional):**  If a physical robotic arm is available, send the detected object's coordinates to the arm's controller to move the arm to pick up the object.  Simple simulations will use only screen position output to a simulated arm
- **GUI (Optional):** A basic graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to display the webcam feed, detected object bounding boxes, and position data.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Object Detection Setup:** Import necessary libraries, load a pre-trained object detection model, and initialize the webcam feed.  Focus on a lightweight model for real-time processing.
2. **Object Tracking Implementation:** Integrate a tracking algorithm to follow the detected object across frames, updating its position coordinates.
3. **Coordinate Reporting:** Display the object's coordinates on the screen either in a text box or overlay it on the video feed.
4. **(Optional) Robotic Arm Integration:** If using a physical robot arm, configure the ROS nodes and topics to send the object coordinates for arm movement. For a simulation, output the coordinates in a format that can be read by a robot arm simulator.
5. **(Optional) GUI Development:** Create a basic GUI to enhance user experience if time permits.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing model accuracy and processing speed can be challenging. Consider using lightweight models and optimizing code for faster execution.  Experiment with different pre-trained models to find the optimum balance.
- **Object Occlusion:** Dealing with scenarios where the object is partially or fully occluded requires robust tracking algorithms. Implement checks for object disappearance and restart detection processes.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision concepts:** Object detection, tracking algorithms, image processing.
- **Gain experience with robotic system integration (optional):** ROS basics, robot arm control, interfacing with sensors.
