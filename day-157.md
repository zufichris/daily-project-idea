# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a simple, yet engaging, mini-game (e.g., a simplified version of Pong or Snake) and implementing a basic AI opponent using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The goal is to demonstrate a functional RL agent within a limited timeframe, showcasing core RL concepts and AI implementation.  The significance lies in experiencing the iterative nature of RL training and observing its effectiveness in a controlled environment.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (for RL implementation) or Stable Baselines3 (simpler RL library)
- **Tools:**  A suitable code editor (VS Code, PyCharm), Python virtual environment.

## Features & Requirements
- **Functional Game:** A playable mini-game with basic controls and game logic.
- **RL Agent:** An AI opponent that learns to play the game through reinforcement learning.
- **Reward System:** A defined reward function to guide the agent's learning (e.g., points for winning, penalties for losing).
- **Training Visualization:**  Basic visualization of the agent's performance during training (e.g., score over time).
- **Basic Game Over Detection:** The game should end appropriately and reset.

- **Advanced Features:** (Optional) Implementing a more sophisticated reward function incorporating factors like game speed or efficiency.
- **Advanced Features:** (Optional)  Using a more advanced RL algorithm (e.g., DQN instead of a simpler approach).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Development:**  Create the basic game framework using Pygame. Focus on core functionality â€“ player movement, ball physics (if applicable), scoring.
2. **RL Agent Design:** Define the state space, action space, and reward function for the RL agent. Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that interacts with the game environment, collects data, and updates the agent's policy.
4. **Visualization:** Add basic plotting to visualize the agent's learning progress (e.g., average score per episode).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the agent's performance and iterate on the reward function or RL algorithm as needed to improve gameplay.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Experimentation might be necessary.
- **Training Time:** Depending on the chosen RL algorithm and game complexity, training might require a significant amount of time.  Prioritizing a simple, fast-training algorithm is crucial for a one- or two-day project.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like state, action, reward, and policy.
- **Agent-Environment Interaction:**  It provides hands-on experience designing and implementing an agent that learns through interaction with an environment.
