# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a system that allows a robotic arm to detect and track a specific object in real-time using a camera feed. The goal is to create a prototype that can identify and follow a colored object, demonstrating basic computer vision and robotic control integration.  This is significant as it forms a foundation for more complex robotic manipulation tasks.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, specific manufacturer's SDK), potentially TensorFlow/PyTorch for advanced object detection.
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (e.g., Dobot, UR3e), a webcam or camera.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** The system should accurately detect a pre-defined colored object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view.
- **Object Tracking:**  The system should continuously track the object's position as it moves.
- **Arm Control:** The robotic arm should move to position itself above the detected object.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for cases where the object is not detected or goes out of view.
- **GUI (Optional):** A basic graphical user interface to display the camera feed and tracked object's position.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement object classification to handle multiple types of objects.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add obstacle avoidance functionality to prevent the arm from colliding with objects.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Object Detection Setup:** Use OpenCV to capture the camera feed, define the color range for the target object, and implement color thresholding to isolate the object.
2. **Object Tracking:** Employ a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter or optical flow) to maintain track of the object's position across frames.
3. **Robotic Arm Integration:** Interface with the robotic arm's control library, sending commands to move the arm based on the tracked object's coordinates. Account for coordinate transformations between camera and robot coordinates.
4. **Testing and Calibration:** Test the system with the target object in various positions and orientations.  Calibrate the camera and robot arm for accurate positioning.
5. **GUI Development (Optional):** Develop a simple GUI (e.g., using Tkinter or PyQt) to visualize the process.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can affect color detection accuracy.  Consider implementing robust lighting compensation techniques.
- **Coordinate Transformations:** Accurately mapping the camera's coordinate system to the robot's coordinate system is crucial for precise movement.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Techniques:** This project reinforces skills in image processing, color thresholding, and object tracking algorithms.
- **Robotics Control:** It provides practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic arm control, including coordinate transformations and error handling.
