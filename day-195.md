# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Mobile Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic system for real-time object detection and tracking using a mobile robot platform, allowing the robot to autonomously navigate towards and follow a specific target object. This showcases fundamental concepts in computer vision, robotics, and embedded systems, focusing on efficient implementation within a limited timeframe. The significance lies in its applicability to various automation tasks, such as warehouse logistics, search and rescue operations, and surveillance.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), TensorFlow Lite (for object detection), ROS (Robot Operating System - optional, for robot control, otherwise direct motor control via serial/GPIO)
* **Hardware:**  Raspberry Pi (or similar SBC) with camera, a small mobile robot platform (e.g., a wheeled robot kit), object to be tracked.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across frames using OpenCV's tracking algorithms.
- **Robot Navigation:** Control the robot's movement based on the tracked object's position, aiming to keep the object centered in the camera frame.
- **Distance Estimation:** (Optional) Estimate the distance to the object using depth information (if available from camera or additional sensors).
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** (Optional) Implement basic obstacle avoidance using additional sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, potentially ROS) on the Raspberry Pi. Download a pre-trained object detection model optimized for mobile devices.
2. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Implement the object detection pipeline using the chosen model and OpenCV. Integrate an appropriate tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, optical flow).
3. **Robot Control Integration:**  Interface with the robot's motor control system.  Implement a control algorithm (e.g., PID controller) to adjust the robot's movement based on the object's position relative to the center of the camera frame.
4. **Testing and Calibration:** Test the system, fine-tune the control parameters, and calibrate the camera if necessary.
5. **Optional Enhancements:** Integrate distance estimation and/or obstacle avoidance if time permits.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:**  Real-time processing on a resource-constrained platform like a Raspberry Pi can be challenging. Optimize the code and choose efficient algorithms to ensure smooth operation.
- **Robustness:**  The system's performance might be affected by lighting conditions, object occlusions, and variations in object appearance. Consider incorporating error handling and resilience techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience** with real-time computer vision and mobile robotics.
- **Reinforcement** of skills in integrating different software libraries and hardware components.
