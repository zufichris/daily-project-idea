# AI-Powered Real-time Object Classification for a Robot Arm

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic system for a robotic arm to identify and classify objects in real-time using a pre-trained AI model.  The focus will be on integrating a readily available object detection model with a simple robotic arm control interface. This will demonstrate a fundamental aspect of robotic automation â€“ perception and action integration.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch (for pre-trained model loading and inference), a robotic arm library (e.g., a specific library depending on the robotic arm used, such as for Arduino or a commercial arm).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a small, low-cost one is sufficient), a webcam or camera.
- **AI Model:** A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, EfficientDet Lite) downloadable from TensorFlow Hub or PyTorch Hub.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Object Detection:** The system must detect and classify objects within the camera's view in real-time (at least 10 frames per second).
- **Object Classification:** The system must accurately classify detected objects into predefined categories (e.g., "ball," "cube," "cylinder").
- **Robotic Arm Control:** Basic control commands (e.g., move to a specified (x,y) coordinate) must be implemented to allow the robot arm to interact with a detected object.
- **GUI (Optional):** A simple graphical user interface to display the camera feed, object classifications, and robot arm controls.
- **Data Logging (Advanced):** Optionally, log the detected objects, their locations, and the robot's actions for analysis.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained object detection model. Connect the robotic arm and camera.
2. **Integrate Object Detection:** Implement the object detection pipeline using OpenCV and the chosen AI model. This involves loading the model, processing camera frames, and obtaining bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.
3. **Implement Robotic Arm Control:** Write the code to send commands to the robotic arm based on the detected object's location and class. This will likely involve coordinate transformations and inverse kinematics (simplified if using a commercially available robotic arm library).
4. **Combine and Test:** Integrate the object detection and robot arm control modules. Test the system by placing objects in front of the camera and observing the robot's response.
5. **(Optional) Implement GUI or Data Logging:** Add a GUI to visualize the process or enable data logging functionality if time permits.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Object Detection:** The accuracy of the pre-trained model may vary depending on the objects and lighting conditions. Consider using data augmentation or fine-tuning if accuracy is insufficient.
- **Robotic Arm Calibration:**  Ensure accurate calibration of the robot arm to avoid collisions or inaccurate movements. This might involve a simple calibration routine.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of AI model integration:**  This project provides practical experience in deploying and using pre-trained AI models for a real-world application.
- **Gain experience with robot control and sensor integration:** The project enhances practical skills in integrating sensor data with robotic control systems, a crucial aspect of robotics engineering.
