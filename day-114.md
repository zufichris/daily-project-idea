# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using micro-gestures captured by a webcam. The system will leverage machine learning to recognize simple hand gestures, translating them into commands for controlling lights, appliances, or other IoT devices. This is a significant step towards more intuitive and seamless human-computer interaction in smart homes.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow/Keras (machine learning), MediaPipe (gesture recognition)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE, a webcam


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  Capture a live video feed from the webcam using OpenCV.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model using MediaPipe or a custom dataset of pre-recorded gestures (e.g., hand wave for light on/off, fist for volume up/down).
- **Command Translation:** Map recognized gestures to specific smart home device commands (e.g., turning on/off lights, adjusting volume).
- **Device Control:**  Utilize a simple API or existing smart home framework (e.g., Home Assistant API) to send commands to connected devices.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display recognized gestures and corresponding commands on the screen.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple User Support:**  Train the model to recognize gestures from multiple users.
- **Background Subtraction:** Implement background subtraction to improve gesture recognition accuracy in complex environments.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition/Preparation:**  Record a small dataset of micro-gestures (5-10 examples per gesture).  Consider using MediaPipe's pre-trained models for a quicker start.
2. **Model Training:** Train a CNN model (potentially using transfer learning) to classify the recorded gestures. Use a simple model architecture to keep training time short.
3. **Gesture Detection & Command Mapping:** Integrate the trained model with OpenCV to detect gestures in real-time. Map detected gestures to specific commands.
4. **Smart Home Integration:**  Implement the code to send commands to your smart home devices (simulated devices are acceptable).
5. **GUI Development:** Create a basic GUI to display the video feed, recognized gestures, and control options.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Augmentation:**  A small dataset might lead to overfitting.  Data augmentation techniques (e.g., image rotation, scaling) can help mitigate this.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and speed is crucial for real-time application.  Consider optimizing the model architecture and using efficient inference techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  Reinforce the application of OpenCV for real-time video processing and gesture detection.
- **Fundamentals of Machine Learning:** Gain experience in training and implementing a simple CNN model for classification tasks.
