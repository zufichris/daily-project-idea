# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on creating a functional AI opponent within a limited timeframe, showcasing the core principles of reinforcement learning. The significance lies in understanding how to apply RL to a well-defined problem and observe learning progress within a short period.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, optional), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning model), NumPy (for numerical computation).

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -  A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -  A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA) that learns to play the game.
    -  Training loop for the agent to learn optimal strategies.
    -  Visualization of agent performance (win rate, etc.) over training iterations.
    -  Basic game interface (text-based is sufficient for this scope).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:**  Define the game rules and create a function to represent the game state (board).  If using OpenAI Gym, create a custom environment; otherwise, build the game logic directly.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for simplicity).  Implement the agent's logic, including state representation, action selection, reward function, and learning update rule.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a loop that repeatedly plays the game, allowing the agent to learn from its experiences. Track agent performance metrics (e.g., win rate).
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance against a simple random opponent or a human player.  Analyze the learning curve.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If time permits, create a basic plot showing the agent's win rate over training iterations.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for guiding the agent's learning. An improperly designed reward function can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions) is essential for efficient learning.  Experiment with different exploration strategies (e.g., Îµ-greedy).

## Learning Outcomes
-  Understanding the core concepts of reinforcement learning (e.g., states, actions, rewards, Q-values).
-  Practical experience in implementing a simple RL algorithm and applying it to a game environment.
