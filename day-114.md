# Mini-Game AI Opponent using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using a basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm like Q-learning.  The goal is to create a functional, albeit possibly not perfect, AI opponent within a day or two, demonstrating a core concept of RL in a practical setting.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and iterative improvement rather than building a world-class AI.


## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- A suitable game library (e.g., Pygame for visualization, or a custom implementation for simplicity)


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Engine:**  A functional game engine for the chosen game (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
- **RL Agent:**  Implementation of a Q-learning algorithm to train the AI opponent.
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the AI agent against itself or a random opponent.
- **Game Play:**  The ability for a human player to play against the trained AI.
- **Data Persistence:** Optionally, save and load trained Q-tables to avoid retraining from scratch each time.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Incorporate an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation during training.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Implement a simple GUI using Pygame for visualization.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Engine:** Create a basic game engine with functions for making moves, checking for wins/draws, and displaying the game state.
2. **Q-learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm with a suitable state representation (e.g., a flattened game board) and reward function (e.g., +1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for draws).
3. **Training:** Run the training loop, allowing the AI to play against itself (or a random player) for a set number of iterations.
4. **Game Play Integration:** Integrate the trained AI into the game engine, allowing a human player to play against it.
5. **Evaluation (Optional):** Evaluate the AI's performance against a human player or a more sophisticated AI (if time permits).


## Challenges & Considerations
- **State Space Explosion:**  For more complex games, the state space can become very large, potentially slowing down training.  Simplifications or alternative RL methods might be needed.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal learning rates, discount factors, and epsilon values might require experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning).
- Understanding of the concepts of state, action, reward, and policy in RL.
- Experience in rapid prototyping and iterative development in a challenging AI context.
