# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic self-balancing robotic arm controlled via a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.  The goal is to create a system where the arm maintains a stable upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating a fundamental concept in robotics control systems.  This project is focused on the control algorithm implementation and testing, assuming readily available hardware components.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID control implementation), Pygame (for visualization - optional, can be replaced with simpler plotting)
* **Hardware (Assumed Available):**  A small, lightweight robotic arm with at least one degree of freedom (DOF), an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) providing angle and angular velocity data, a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) to interface with the IMU and motor drivers.


## Features & Requirements

- **IMU Data Acquisition:**  Read angle and angular velocity data from the IMU.
- **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller to maintain the arm's upright position.
- **Motor Control:** Send control signals to the arm's motor based on the PID controller's output.
- **Stability Maintenance:** The arm should remain upright despite small perturbations (e.g., gentle taps).
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record IMU data and controller output for analysis.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement automatic gain tuning of the PID controller based on performance metrics.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a setpoint feature allowing users to specify a desired angle for the arm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition:**  Establish communication between the microcontroller and the computer.  Read and verify IMU data (angle and angular velocity) in real-time.
2. **PID Controller Design:** Implement the PID algorithm in Python, defining the proportional (Kp), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains. Start with initial gain values based on literature or intuition.
3. **Control Loop Integration:** Combine the IMU data acquisition and PID controller.  Send the controller's output (motor control signal) to the microcontroller.
4. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the system and iteratively adjust the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal stability and response.  Observe the arm's behavior and fine-tune the gains until satisfactory performance is achieved.
5. **(Optional) Data Visualization and Analysis:** Use Pygame or other plotting tools to visualize the IMU data, controller output, and error signals. Analyze the data to further optimize the controller.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Gain Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments and experimentation. Starting with low gains and gradually increasing them is recommended.
- **Noise in IMU Data:** IMU data often contains noise. Implementing appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) could improve the controller's performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control principles:** This project provides hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and tuning PID controllers, a crucial concept in robotics and control systems.
- **Practical experience with sensor data integration and actuation:** This project enhances skills in integrating sensor data (from the IMU) and controlling actuators (the robotic arm motor).
