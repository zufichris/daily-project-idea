# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures. The system will demonstrate the integration of speech recognition, computer vision, and microcontroller communication for a seamless user experience.  This is significant because it showcases a multi-modal interaction paradigm increasingly demanded in modern smart home technology.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Languages:** Python
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow Lite (for object detection), SpeechRecognition (for speech recognition), PySerial (for microcontroller communication)
* **Hardware:**  Raspberry Pi (or similar microcontroller), a webcam, a smart appliance (e.g., a lamp with a relay-controlled power switch), optionally an Arduino for simplified appliance control.

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Users can turn the appliance ON/OFF using voice commands ("Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan").
- **Gesture Control:**  Users can turn the appliance ON/OFF using predefined hand gestures (e.g., waving hand in front of the camera).
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system provides visual feedback on the appliance's status (ON/OFF) on the screen.
- **Error Handling:** The system gracefully handles cases where voice commands or gestures are not recognized.
- **Appliance Status Monitoring:**  The system monitors the current status of the appliance to ensure consistent operation.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Brightness/Speed Control:** Allow users to adjust the brightness of a lamp or the speed of a fan via voice or gesture commands.
- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Extend the system to control multiple appliances.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Hardware and Software Environment:** Install required libraries, connect the webcam and smart appliance to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Develop the Speech Recognition Module:** Implement a function to capture audio input, transcribe it, and parse commands to determine the action (ON/OFF).
3. **Implement Gesture Recognition:**  Use TensorFlow Lite to train a model for detecting predefined hand gestures.  Use OpenCV to capture and process video from the webcam.
4. **Integrate with Appliance Control:** Send ON/OFF commands (via serial communication or other suitable method) to the microcontroller controlling the appliance based on voice or gesture input.
5. **Develop User Interface:** Create a basic GUI (e.g., using Tkinter or PyQt) to display appliance status and provide feedback to the user.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech and Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with noisy environments and variations in user pronunciations/gestures. Consider implementing confidence thresholds and error handling.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing the processing speed of both voice and gesture recognition to ensure responsiveness.  Consider optimizing model sizes and using efficient algorithms.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multi-modal Interaction Design:** Gain experience in designing and implementing systems that respond to multiple input modalities.
- **Embedded Systems Integration:**  Learn how to integrate software components with hardware for real-world applications.
