# Automated Code Style Enforcement Tool for Python

## Overview

This project aims to create a command-line tool that automatically enforces a specific Python code style (e.g., PEP 8) on a given Python file or directory.  The tool will identify style violations, automatically correct them where possible, and provide a report of remaining issues for manual review.  This is significant because consistent code style enhances readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pycodestyle` (or `flake8`), `autopep8` (or `black`)
- **Tools:** Command-line interface (CLI) framework (e.g., `click`, `typer`), potentially a simple text-based progress indicator.


## Features & Requirements

- **Automated Style Checking:**  Analyze Python code for style violations based on a chosen style guide (PEP 8 as default).
- **Automatic Correction:** Automatically correct easily fixable style violations (e.g., whitespace, line length).
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generate a report listing all identified style violations, categorized by type and severity.
- **Configurable Style Guide:** Allow users to specify the style guide to be enforced (e.g., through command-line arguments).
- **Recursive Directory Traversal:**  Ability to process multiple Python files within a given directory recursively.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integration with a version control system (e.g., Git) to automatically stage corrected files.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Support for custom style rules beyond the standard style guide.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Dependency Management:** Create a new Python project, install necessary libraries (`pycodestyle`, `autopep8`, `click`), and set up the basic CLI structure using `click`.
2. **Code Analysis and Correction:** Implement the core functionality: using `pycodestyle` to identify violations and `autopep8` to automatically correct them.  Handle cases where automatic correction isn't possible.
3. **Report Generation:**  Develop a clear and informative report showing the number of violations, their types, and locations within the code.  Consider using a tabular format for better readability.
4. **Recursive Directory Handling:**  Implement functionality to recursively traverse directories and process all Python files found within.
5. **CLI Enhancements (Optional):** Add command-line arguments for configuring the style guide and other options (e.g., verbosity, output format).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Ambiguous Corrections:** `autopep8` might not always produce the intended outcome for complex style violations.  Careful consideration of edge cases is necessary.  Providing options for manual review of suggested changes will mitigate this.
- **Error Handling:** The tool must gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., invalid file paths, syntax errors in the input code).  Robust error messages are critical for usability.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce CLI Development Skills:**  Practicing building command-line tools strengthens understanding of argument parsing, input/output handling, and user interaction.
- **Mastering Code Style and Linting:**  This project deepens the understanding of code style guidelines and the tools used to enforce them, promoting better coding practices.
