# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, mini-game and implement a rudimentary AI opponent using reinforcement learning. The focus is on a quick implementation using a readily available library, showcasing the power and simplicity of reinforcement learning in game AI.  The game itself will be straightforward to allow for rapid development and focus on the AI implementation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development and rendering)
- Stable Baselines3 (or similar RL library like RLlib)  - for reinforcement learning algorithms

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Game Mechanics:** A simple 2D game, e.g., a single-player version of Pong or a simple maze navigation game.
- **AI Opponent:**  An AI opponent controlled by a reinforcement learning agent.
- **Training Environment:** A training environment that allows the AI to learn through interactions.
- **Game Visualization:** Real-time rendering of the game state with the AI agent's actions.
- **Basic Reward System:** A simple reward system to guide the AI's learning (e.g., points for success, penalties for failure).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Hyperparameter tuning for the RL agent to optimize performance.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implementation of a different reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., DQN vs. PPO).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Development:** Create the basic game using Pygame. Focus on simple graphics and straightforward game mechanics.
2. **Environment Setup:** Design the game environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the RL agent. Define states, actions, and rewards clearly.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization from Stable Baselines3) to control the AI opponent.
4. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop to allow the AI agent to learn through interactions with the game environment.
5. **Visualization & Evaluation:**  Visualize the AI's learning progress and evaluate its performance against a simple baseline (e.g., random actions).

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the AI towards desired behavior can be challenging. Experimentation might be needed to find a suitable reward structure.
- **Training Time:**  Achieving optimal AI performance might require significant training time, even for a simple game.  Prioritizing a quick, functional solution is key for this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementation in a real-world scenario (game AI).
- Understanding of the key components of a reinforcement learning environment (state, action, reward).
- Hands-on experience with Pygame for game development and Stable Baselines3 for reinforcement learning.
