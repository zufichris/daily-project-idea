# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a rudimentary self-balancing robot arm using a single servo motor and a minimal sensor setup. The focus will be on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain the arm's balance against external disturbances.  This is a simplified version of a complex control problem, making it feasible for a short timeframe, yet still offers valuable learning opportunities in control systems engineering.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries mentioned below)
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano (or similar)
* **Servo Motor:** A standard hobby servo motor
* **Sensor:**  MPU6050 6-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for angle and acceleration data.
* **Libraries:**  `PySerial` (for Arduino communication), a suitable Python PID control library (e.g., `simple_pid`).


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balance:** The arm should maintain an upright position when initially placed.
- **Disturbance Rejection:** The arm should resist minor external pushes or taps and return to its upright position.
- **Angle Measurement & Feedback:** Accurate angle measurement from the IMU is crucial for the PID controller.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A functional PID controller adjusts the servo motor to counteract deviations from the desired angle (upright).
- **Serial Communication:** Reliable serial communication between the Arduino (IMU and servo control) and the Python script (PID calculations and data visualization).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Visual feedback using a simple GUI (matplotlib).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implementing a feedforward component to the PID controller for improved responsiveness.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU and servo motor to the Arduino.  Ensure power supply is adequate.
2. **Arduino Programming:** Write Arduino code to read IMU data (angle), send it to the computer via serial, and control the servo motor based on commands received from the computer.
3. **Python PID Controller:** Implement the PID controller in Python. It should receive angle data, calculate control signals, and send them to the Arduino.
4. **Calibration & Tuning:** Calibrate the IMU and tune the PID controller gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal balance. This is an iterative process.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system's response to disturbances and fine-tune the PID parameters for improved performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires careful adjustment. Starting with conservative values and gradually increasing them is recommended.
- **Sensor Noise:** The IMU may produce noisy data. Implementing a simple moving average filter or other noise reduction techniques may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:** Practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller.
- **Embedded Systems Integration:**  Experience in interfacing a microcontroller with sensors and actuators, and communicating with a computer.
