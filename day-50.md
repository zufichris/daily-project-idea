# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, 2D game and implement a basic reinforcement learning agent to play it.  The game will be minimal, allowing focus on the AI implementation.  The significance lies in applying reinforcement learning principles in a tangible, short-term project. This allows for a practical understanding of core RL concepts and algorithm implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning), NumPy
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple Game Engine:** Create a basic 2D game environment using Pygame (e.g., a maze navigation game or a simple platformer).
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Implement a Q-learning agent to learn optimal actions within the game environment.
- **Reward System:** Define a clear reward system within the game to guide the agent's learning (e.g., reaching a goal, avoiding obstacles).
- **Training and Evaluation:** Train the agent and evaluate its performance through metrics like average reward or completion time.
- **Visualization:**  Visualize the agent's progress and learning process within the game.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for improved performance in more complex games.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to control training parameters or view performance statistics.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Design and implement the core game mechanics using Pygame. Focus on a simple yet engaging game.
2. **Environment Definition:** Define the game environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) suitable for reinforcement learning.  This includes defining states, actions, rewards, and transitions.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm or DQN. Choose a suitable hyperparameter configuration for the learning process.
4. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop to run the agent in the game environment, allowing it to learn through trial and error.
5. **Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluate the agent's performance and visualize its learning curve and gameplay.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the reinforcement learning algorithm can be challenging and time-consuming.  Start with sensible defaults and adjust iteratively.
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent toward desired behavior can be tricky. Consider different reward schemes to optimize performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain hands-on experience with Q-learning or DQN implementation.
- **Game Development with Pygame:**  Develop basic skills in game development using Python and Pygame.
