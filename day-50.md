# TinyML-Powered Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype for a gesture-based smart home control system using a microcontroller with TinyML capabilities.  The system will recognize a small set of predefined hand gestures captured by a low-resolution camera and trigger corresponding actions, such as turning lights on/off or adjusting volume.  This demonstrates the feasibility of embedding sophisticated machine learning models directly into resource-constrained devices for edge computing applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with onboard sensor and sufficient memory)
* **Programming Language:** C++ with Arduino framework
* **Machine Learning Library:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
* **Camera:** OV7670 camera module (or similar low-resolution camera)
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE
* **Dataset:**  A small, custom dataset of hand gestures (can be created quickly).


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:**  Capture images from the camera module.
- **Gesture Classification:** Classify captured images into predefined gestures (e.g., "wave," "thumbs up," "fist").
- **Action Triggering:** Execute pre-programmed actions based on classified gestures (e.g., controlling smart lights, playing/pausing music).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process gestures and trigger actions with minimal latency.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy a trained TensorFlow Lite Micro model onto the microcontroller.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
-  Calibration routine to account for varying lighting conditions.
-  User interface for selecting gestures and assigning actions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Dataset Creation:** Collect a small dataset of images representing the chosen gestures. Aim for 50-100 images per gesture.
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow Lite Model Maker or a similar tool. Quantize the model for optimal performance on the microcontroller.
3. **Model Deployment:** Convert the trained model into a TensorFlow Lite Micro format and deploy it to the microcontroller.
4. **Integration with Hardware:** Integrate the camera module with the microcontroller and implement the image acquisition and processing pipeline.
5. **Action Implementation:** Implement the logic to trigger actions based on the gesture classification results (e.g., using Bluetooth LE to communicate with smart home devices).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy with a small dataset might be challenging.  Consider using data augmentation techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing model accuracy and real-time processing speed on a resource-constrained device requires careful optimization.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience with TinyML model development, deployment, and optimization.
- Hands-on understanding of integrating machine learning models into embedded systems.
