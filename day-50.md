# Minimax AI for Tic-Tac-Toe with Visualization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Minimax AI agent for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, incorporating a visual representation of the game state and the AI's decision-making process.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental AI algorithm and its application in a simple yet engaging game, offering a clear visualization of the algorithm's search tree.  This is easily expandable for further learning.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (optional, for board representation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Logic:** Implement the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe, handling player turns and win/draw conditions.
- **Minimax AI:** Develop an AI agent using the Minimax algorithm to play optimally against a human player.
- **Visualization:**  Display the game board graphically using Pygame, highlighting the AI's chosen moves.
- **User Interface:** Allow the human player to interact with the game board using mouse clicks.
- **Win/Loss/Draw Detection:** Accurately determine the game outcome and display it to the user.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize the Minimax algorithm's performance.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add a difficulty setting that adjusts the search depth of the Minimax algorithm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board & Logic:** Create a data structure (e.g., a list or NumPy array) to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board and implement functions for making moves, checking for wins, and determining draws.
2. **Minimax Implementation:** Implement the Minimax algorithm recursively, evaluating game states and selecting the move with the highest score (or lowest for the minimizing player).
3. **Pygame Integration:** Use Pygame to create a visual representation of the game board and handle user input (mouse clicks).
4. **Game Loop:** Combine the game logic, AI, and visualization components into a main game loop that handles player turns and updates the display.
5. **Win/Loss/Draw Display:** Display the outcome of the game (win, loss, or draw) clearly to the user.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Minimax Implementation Complexity:**  Understanding and correctly implementing the recursive Minimax algorithm can be challenging. Thorough testing is crucial.
- **Pygame Integration:**  Integrating the game logic with the Pygame visual representation requires careful management of events and updates.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of AI concepts:** This project reinforces understanding of the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental concept in game AI and search algorithms.
- **Practical application of Pygame:** This project provides practical experience in using Pygame for game development, including handling user input, game logic, and visual representation.
