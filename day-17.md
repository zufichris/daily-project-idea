# Automated Code Style Enforcement Bot

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple bot that automatically enforces a consistent code style within a given codebase (e.g., a GitHub repository). The bot will analyze newly pushed commits and identify style violations according to a predefined style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).  This is significant because maintaining consistent code style improves readability, collaboration, and maintainability.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pylint`, `flake8` (or similar linters), `requests` (for interacting with GitHub API), `GitHub API v3`.
- **Tools:**  GitHub account, suitable text editor or IDE.


## Features & Requirements

- **Automated Style Check:** Analyze pushed commits for style violations using a chosen linter.
- **GitHub Integration:**  Connect to a GitHub repository via the GitHub API.
- **Violation Reporting:**  Post comments on pull requests indicating lines with style violations.
- **Configurable Style Guide:** Allow for easy switching between different linters and style guides.
- **Severity Filtering:**  Allow configuration to only report violations above a specified severity level.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Automated code formatting (using tools like `black` or `autopep8`).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Integration with a project management tool (e.g., Jira) to create tickets for severe style violations.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Configuration:**  Set up a Python environment, install necessary libraries, and configure the chosen linter and style guide. Obtain a GitHub Personal Access Token.
2. **GitHub API Interaction:**  Write code to fetch commits and pull request data from the GitHub API.
3. **Linting and Analysis:**  Implement code to analyze commits using the chosen linter and identify style violations.
4. **Violation Reporting:**  Develop the logic to post comments on pull requests with details of the violations.
5. **Testing and Deployment:** Test the bot thoroughly on a test repository and deploy it to the target repository (e.g., as a GitHub Action).

## Challenges & Considerations

- **GitHub API Rate Limits:**  Managing API requests to avoid exceeding rate limits.  Implementing appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms is crucial.
- **False Positives:**  Some linters might report false positives.  Careful configuration and potentially manual review of reported violations may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of API Interaction:**  Gain practical experience interacting with a RESTful API (GitHub API).
- **Improved understanding of Code Style Enforcement:**  Deepen understanding of code style guidelines and the tools used to enforce them.
