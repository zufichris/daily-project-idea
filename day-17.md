# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition via a webcam.  This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and machine learning in a home automation context, focusing on a streamlined and efficient implementation within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite (optional for model optimization)
- **Hardware:** Webcam, Smart Home Appliance (e.g., a smart bulb controllable via API), Computer with Python environment.
- **Optional:**  Raspberry Pi for a more portable and embedded solution.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Hand Detection:**  Accurately detect and track a user's hand in the webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize predefined gestures (e.g., wave for on/off, fist for brightness/speed adjustment).
- **Appliance Control:** Send commands to the smart home appliance based on the recognized gesture.
- **Calibration:**  Allow for initial calibration of the hand position and gesture thresholds.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the recognized gesture and corresponding appliance state on the screen.


- **Advanced Feature 1:** Incorporate multiple user profiles with personalized gesture mappings.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a simple machine learning model for gesture recognition, instead of relying solely on MediaPipe's pre-trained models.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Dependencies:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe). Configure access to the smart home appliance API (if required).
2. **Hand Detection & Tracking:** Implement hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution. Display the webcam feed with hand landmarks overlaid.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Define a set of simple gestures and create logic to recognize them based on hand landmark positions and relative movements.
4. **Appliance Control Integration:** Integrate the gesture recognition with the smart home appliance API to send commands (e.g., turn on/off, adjust brightness).
5. **GUI & Feedback:** Create a simple graphical user interface to display the recognized gesture and the current state of the appliance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Robustness against variations in lighting, hand position, and background clutter can be challenging in a short timeframe.  Simplifying gestures and using clear hand poses will mitigate this.
- **API Integration:**  Different smart home appliances use varying APIs.  Ensure compatibility and efficient command transmission.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of computer vision:** Hands-on experience with real-time image processing and hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Integration of different technologies:** Combining computer vision, machine learning (potentially), and smart home APIs to create a functional system.
