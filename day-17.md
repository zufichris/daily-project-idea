# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and implementing a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it.  The focus is on rapid prototyping using a lightweight RL algorithm to demonstrate the core concepts within a short timeframe. The significance lies in showcasing the power of RL in creating adaptive AI agents for simple games, which serves as a building block for more complex applications.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for game development), TensorFlow/Keras (or a simpler RL library like Stable Baselines3) for reinforcement learning.
- Tools:  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a grid-based maze navigation or a simple platformer).
    - An RL agent that learns to navigate or play the game through trial and error.
    - Basic reward system to guide the agent's learning (e.g., reward for reaching a goal, penalty for collisions).
    - Visualization of the game and the agent's performance.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a different RL algorithm (e.g., DQN instead of a simpler approach).
    - Adding a simple user interface for controlling game parameters.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Development:** Create a basic 2D game environment using Pygame. This should involve defining the game's rules, rendering the game visually, and handling user input (if needed for testing).
2. **RL Agent Design:**  Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA). Define the agent's state space, action space, and reward function based on the game.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop where the agent interacts with the environment, receives rewards, and updates its policy based on the chosen RL algorithm.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance by running it on the game environment without training and observing its success rate.
5. **Visualization and Refinement:** Visualize the agent's actions and learning process.  Iteratively refine the reward function or RL algorithm to improve performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Shaping:** Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Experimentation and iterative refinement are crucial.
- **Computational Resources:** Training an RL agent can be computationally intensive. For a quick prototype, consider simplifying the game environment or using a less computationally expensive algorithm.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and understanding a basic RL algorithm.
- Game AI Development:  Practical experience in building and integrating an AI agent into a game environment.
