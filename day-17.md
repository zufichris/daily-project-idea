# Minimalist Robotic Arm Path Planning with Collision Avoidance

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified path planning algorithm for a robotic arm with collision avoidance, suitable for a minimalist 2D or 3D environment.  The goal is to efficiently generate a collision-free path from a starting to a target position, prioritizing simplicity and computational efficiency over sophisticated path optimization.  This is significant for rapid prototyping and educational purposes, demonstrating core concepts in robotics without extensive setup.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization), potentially Pygame or similar for simple GUI (optional)
* **Robotics Simulation (Optional):**  PyBullet or a similar physics engine for a more realistic simulation.  If skipped, a simplified 2D representation can be used.


## Features & Requirements

- **Path Generation:**  The algorithm should generate a sequence of waypoints for the robotic arm to follow, avoiding collisions with obstacles.  A simple algorithm like A* or a variation will suffice.
- **Collision Detection:** Implement a basic collision detection system, checking if the arm's links intersect with any obstacles in the environment.  Simple bounding box checks will suffice for the day's scope.
- **Obstacle Representation:** Define obstacles in the environment using simple geometric shapes (circles, squares, etc.).
- **Visualization:** Visualize the robot arm, obstacles, and planned path using Matplotlib.
- **Basic Arm Kinematics:**  Represent the robotic arm with at least 2 links (2 degrees of freedom), modeling its position and orientation.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated collision detection method (e.g., polygon collision detection).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integrate with a simple robotics simulator (PyBullet) for a more realistic simulation.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the robot arm's geometry (link lengths, etc.), obstacle positions and shapes, start and target positions.
2. **Path Planning Algorithm:** Implement a simple pathfinding algorithm (A* is recommended for its ease of implementation and good performance for this scope)  to find a collision-free path.
3. **Collision Detection:**  Implement the collision detection system to check for intersections between the robotic arm links and obstacles.
4. **Visualization:**  Visualize the environment, obstacles, robot arm, and generated path using Matplotlib.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the algorithm with different obstacle configurations and refine it as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Efficiency:**  For larger environments or more complex robot configurations, the path planning algorithm may become computationally expensive.  Focus on efficient data structures and algorithm design to mitigate this.
- **Collision Detection Complexity:**  Accurate collision detection can be computationally expensive.  Prioritize simple yet effective methods for the scope of this daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce path planning algorithms:** This project provides hands-on experience with path planning algorithms and their implementation.
- **Understanding of basic robotics concepts:** This project helps develop a foundational understanding of robot kinematics and collision avoidance techniques.
