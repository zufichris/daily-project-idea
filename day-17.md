# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary smart home appliance control system using a Raspberry Pi and a readily available webcam.  The system will allow users to control a single appliance (e.g., a lamp) via voice commands and simple hand gestures. This provides a simplified, yet functional prototype for more complex smart home integrations, focusing on efficient prototyping within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), PyAudio (audio input), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), RPi.GPIO (GPIO control)
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Webcam, Relay Module, Lamp (or other controllable appliance)


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:** Turn the lamp ON/OFF using voice commands ("Turn on the lamp", "Turn off the lamp").
- **Gesture Control:** Turn the lamp ON/OFF using predefined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for ON, closed fist for OFF).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual feedback (e.g., LED on the Raspberry Pi) reflecting the lamp's current state.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for voice recognition and gesture detection failures.
- **GPIO Control:**  Safely interface with the relay module to switch the lamp ON/OFF.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Brightness control via voice or gesture (requires PWM control).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Multiple appliance support (requires additional relay modules and modifications to the code).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the webcam, relay module, and lamp to the Raspberry Pi.  Ensure proper wiring and power supply.
2. **Software Setup:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, PyAudio, SpeechRecognition, RPi.GPIO).
3. **Voice Recognition:** Implement voice command recognition using SpeechRecognition.  Train the model to recognize specific commands.
4. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement gesture recognition using OpenCV.  Define and train the model to recognize the predefined gestures.
5. **Integration & Control:** Integrate the voice and gesture recognition modules to control the relay module and, consequently, the lamp.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Hand gesture recognition can be sensitive to lighting and background conditions.  Consider using a simpler, more robust gesture for initial implementation.
- **Real-time Processing:** Balancing real-time processing of audio and video streams can be challenging.  Prioritize efficient code and consider simplifying features if necessary to meet the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of real-time image and audio processing:** This project provides practical experience with handling and processing real-time data streams using OpenCV and PyAudio.
- **Gain experience with embedded systems and GPIO control:** Working with the Raspberry Pi and GPIO pins will improve understanding of embedded system concepts and interfacing with external hardware.
