# Automated Bug Triage System Prototype

## Overview
This project aims to prototype a simple automated bug triage system that categorizes incoming bug reports based on keywords and predefined rules.  This is a crucial step in software development, saving time and resources by prioritizing critical issues.  This prototype will focus on a limited scope to be achievable within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Regular Expressions
- SQLite (or similar lightweight database)
- A simple text-based UI (or a quick web UI using Flask/FastAPI for a more advanced version)


## Features & Requirements
- **Keyword-based categorization:**  The system should categorize bug reports into predefined categories (e.g., "UI Bug," "Performance Issue," "Security Vulnerability") based on the presence of specific keywords.
- **Regular expression matching:**  The system should use regular expressions to identify specific patterns in bug reports (e.g., error codes, version numbers).
- **Priority assignment:** Based on category and/or keywords, assign a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to each bug report.
- **Data storage:**  Store categorized and prioritized bug reports in a simple database.
- **Basic Reporting:** Generate a simple summary of the number of bugs in each category.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a rudimentary sentiment analysis to identify frustrated users reporting bugs.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Integrate with a simple bug tracking system API (e.g., a mock API for testing).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preparation:** Create a small dataset of sample bug reports with relevant keywords and categories. Define keywords and regular expressions for each category.  This could be a simple CSV file.
2. **Categorization Engine:** Develop the core Python logic to analyze bug reports using NLTK for keyword extraction and regular expressions for pattern matching. Assign categories and priorities based on the results.
3. **Database Integration:**  Implement database storage to persist the categorized and prioritized bug reports.
4. **User Interface:** Create a simple text-based interface (or a minimal web interface if time permits) to input new bug reports and view the categorized data and summary reports.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with the sample data and refine the keyword lists and regular expressions for better accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Ambiguous language in bug reports:** Natural language processing is inherently challenging; some bug reports may be difficult to categorize automatically.  Using a robust keyword set and regular expressions to mitigate this is crucial.
- **Scalability:** The prototype's simplicity makes it less scalable.  Consider the limitations of using a lightweight database for larger datasets.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce practical application of NLP techniques (keyword extraction, regular expressions).
- Gain experience in building a simple data processing pipeline involving text analysis, database interaction, and a basic user interface.
