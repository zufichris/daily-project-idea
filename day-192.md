# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The focus will be on rapid prototyping and experimentation with different RL algorithms.  The significance lies in understanding and implementing a core concept of AI in a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (for rapid iteration)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -  An RL agent capable of learning through trial and error.
    -  Training loop with clear performance metrics (e.g., win rate).
    -  Visualization of the agent's learning progress.
    -  Basic agent vs. agent gameplay.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Implementation of a second, different RL algorithm for comparison.
    -  Incorporating a simple human-vs-AI mode.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment using Gym or a custom implementation in Python. Focus on a simple, well-defined state space and action space.
2. **Agent Development:** Implement a Q-learning or SARSA agent.  Choose a pre-built implementation from a library or write a basic one from scratch.
3. **Training Loop:** Design a training loop that iteratively updates the agent's policy based on rewards received from the environment.
4. **Evaluation and Visualization:**  Track the agent's performance (e.g., win rate) over time and visualize its learning curve.
5. **Optional: Algorithm Comparison or Human Interaction:** If time permits, implement a second RL algorithm or a basic human interaction mode.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Carefully designing a reward function that encourages optimal behavior is crucial for effective learning.  Poorly designed rewards can lead to suboptimal strategies.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using actions known to yield good rewards) is essential for efficient learning.  Experiment with different exploration strategies (e.g., Îµ-greedy).


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project provides hands-on experience with core RL concepts like state, action, reward, policy, and value functions.
- **Rapid Prototyping:**  The daily challenge format encourages efficient coding, debugging, and iterative development, reinforcing best practices for rapid prototyping in software engineering.
