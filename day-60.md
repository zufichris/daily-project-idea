# Automated Code Style Enforcement Bot for GitHub

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple GitHub bot that automatically enforces a consistent code style across a repository.  The bot will comment on pull requests (PRs) highlighting style violations detected by a chosen linter. This promotes code readability, maintainability, and collaboration, leading to higher quality codebases.  The focus will be on a minimal viable product (MVP) that can be extended later.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- `github3.py` library (for GitHub API interaction)
- `flake8` (or `pylint`, `mypy` - choose one linter based on language preference)
- A GitHub personal access token (PAT) for API access.


## Features & Requirements

- **Automated Style Check:** The bot automatically comments on new PRs, listing any style violations detected by the chosen linter.
- **Configurable Linter:**  The bot should be configurable to use different linters (e.g., switch between `flake8` and `pylint`).
- **PR Commenting:** The bot posts a clear and concise comment on PRs detailing the lines with violations.
- **Ignore Files/Patterns:** The bot should allow ignoring specific files or patterns to avoid unnecessary comments.
- **Threshold Configuration:** The bot can be configured to only comment if a certain threshold of violations is exceeded.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Automatic PR rejection for severe style violations.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Integration with a code formatting tool for automated fixes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create a Python project, install necessary libraries (`github3.py`, chosen linter), and obtain a GitHub PAT.
2. **Linter Integration:**  Write a function that runs the chosen linter on the changed files within a PR and parses the output to identify violations.
3. **GitHub API Interaction:** Use `github3.py` to fetch PR information (changed files), run the linter, and post comments on the PR using the GitHub API.
4. **Configuration:** Implement a configuration mechanism (e.g., a configuration file) to allow customization of the linter, ignore patterns, and violation threshold.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the bot (e.g., using GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD service) to run automatically on new PRs.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **API Rate Limits:**  The GitHub API has rate limits; efficient coding is essential to avoid exceeding these limits.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial to prevent the bot from crashing due to unexpected input or API errors.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of practical GitHub API usage and interaction with a popular version control platform.
- Gain experience in automating code quality processes and integrating linters into a workflow.
