# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, mini-game AI agent using reinforcement learning techniques. The game will be a simplified version of a classic game (e.g., Pong, Snake), allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different reinforcement learning algorithms.  The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL within a constrained timeframe, highlighting the core principles and potential for more complex applications.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Reinforcement Learning Library: Stable Baselines3
- Game Engine/Library: Pygame (for simplicity and speed)
- Version Control: Git


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable, simplified version of a classic game (e.g., Pong with only one paddle).
    - An AI agent trained using a chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
    - Basic reward system designed to guide the agent towards winning the game.
    - Ability to visualize the agent's learning process (e.g., plotting rewards over time).
    - Ability to save and load trained models.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing different RL algorithms for comparison (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).
    - Incorporating a simple user interface for game interaction and parameter adjustment.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Setup:** Create a basic Pygame implementation of the chosen simplified game.  Focus on core game mechanics and clear reward definition (e.g., +1 for a point, -1 for losing a point).
2. **Environment Wrapper:** Create a wrapper around the Pygame game to integrate it with the Stable Baselines3 library. This will standardize the interaction between the RL agent and the game.
3. **Agent Training:** Choose an RL algorithm (PPO is recommended for its stability) and train the agent for a set number of iterations. Monitor the reward to assess learning progress.
4. **Evaluation and Refinement:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance and adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, number of steps, etc.) as needed to improve performance.
5. **Visualization and Saving:** Visualize the learning curve and save the trained model for later use or comparison.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Shaping:** Designing a clear and effective reward function that accurately guides the agent's learning is crucial.  Poorly designed rewards can lead to suboptimal or unexpected behavior.
- **Computational Resources:** Training RL agents can be computationally intensive.  Balancing the complexity of the model with available resources is important within the daily timeframe.  Consider reducing the game complexity or training duration if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement learning principles:  This project reinforces the understanding of core concepts like reward functions, policy gradients, and the training loop in RL.
- Practical application of RL libraries:  Hands-on experience with a popular RL library like Stable Baselines3, improving familiarity with its functionalities and API.
