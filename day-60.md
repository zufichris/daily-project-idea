# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a system that uses a computer vision model to detect and track a specific object in real-time, feeding the location data to a robotic arm to enable precise grasping and manipulation.  The significance lies in showcasing the integration of computer vision and robotics for automated tasks, ideal for a wide array of applications from warehouse automation to assisted living. The scope will be limited to a single object for a 1-2 day timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
* **Robotics Library:** ROS (Robot Operating System), or a simpler library depending on the robotic arm used (e.g., PySerial for direct serial communication).
* **Machine Learning Model:** Pre-trained YOLOv5 (or similar lightweight object detection model)
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple one), a webcam, and a computer with sufficient processing power.


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red cube) within the webcam's field of view using YOLOv5.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's coordinates across frames using OpenCV's tracking algorithms.
- **Robotic Arm Control:** Transmit the object's coordinates to the robotic arm to guide its movement.
- **Grasping Action:**  Implement a basic grasping action once the object is within the robotic arm's reach (this may be simplified based on arm capabilities).
- **Data Visualization:** Display the object's bounding box and tracked trajectory on the webcam feed.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implement a more sophisticated grasping strategy considering object orientation.
    - Add error handling and robustness to deal with object occlusion or unexpected movements.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries, connect the webcam and robotic arm, and configure the ROS environment (if used). Load the pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:**  Implement the object detection and tracking pipeline using OpenCV.  Focus on efficient processing for real-time performance.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Convert the object's pixel coordinates from the camera frame to the robotic arm's coordinate system. This might involve calibration if precise accuracy is required. (Simplification: use relative coordinates if calibration is too complex).
4. **Robotic Arm Control:** Send the calculated coordinates to the robotic arm using appropriate communication protocols (e.g., ROS topics, serial communication).
5. **Grasping & Feedback:**  Implement the grasping action.  Optional: incorporate visual feedback (checking if the object is grasped successfully)


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Coordinate Transformation:** Accurately mapping camera coordinates to robot arm coordinates can be challenging and require calibration.  This step can be simplified by focusing on relative coordinates for this limited time frame.
- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing accuracy and speed in object detection and tracking is crucial for real-time operation.  Choosing a lightweight model and optimizing code is important.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Integration of Computer Vision and Robotics:** Gain practical experience in integrating computer vision algorithms with robotic control systems.
- **Real-time System Development:**  Develop skills in designing and implementing real-time systems that respond to dynamic inputs.
