# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four) using reinforcement learning (RL). The focus will be on implementing a streamlined RL algorithm and showcasing the learning process within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in understanding the fundamental principles of RL and applying them to a concrete problem.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for RL implementation)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- A simple game engine or library (e.g., Pygame for visualization, or a custom implementation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (e.g., a text-based or graphical Tic-Tac-Toe).
    - An RL agent (using Q-learning or SARSA) that learns optimal strategies through self-play.
    - A mechanism to train the agent and evaluate its performance (win rate).
    - Basic logging and visualization of the training process (e.g., win rate over epochs).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implementing a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network - DQN).
    - Exploring different hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor) and their impact on performance.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Environment:** Create a simple game environment with functions for making moves, checking for wins, and determining game states.  Use a suitable library or implement from scratch.
2. **RL Agent:** Implement a Q-learning or SARSA agent. Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
3. **Training Loop:** Write a training loop that iteratively allows the agent to play against itself, updating its Q-values based on the received rewards.  Include a mechanism to track performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the trained agent against a simple random agent or a human player.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  Visualize the training progress (e.g., plot win rate over time) and, if using a graphical game environment, display the game itself.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm might require experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and iterate based on observations.
- **Convergence:**  Ensuring the agent converges to a reasonably good strategy within the limited time frame might require simplifying the game or using a less computationally expensive RL algorithm.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of reinforcement learning concepts like Q-learning, state-action spaces, reward functions, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
- Practical experience in implementing and training an RL agent in a simple environment.
