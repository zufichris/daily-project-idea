# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic self-balancing robot control system using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The robot will consist of a microcontroller, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), and two motors. The goal is to implement a PID controller to maintain the robot's upright position, demonstrating a fundamental control system concept within a short timeframe. This project focuses on the control algorithm implementation and tuning, rather than complex robot construction.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (pre-assembled preferred for time constraints).
* **IMU:** MPU6050 (pre-wired to the microcontroller).
* **Motors:** Two DC motors with motor drivers (L298N or similar).
* **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE).
* **Libraries:**  MPU6050 library for IMU readings.

## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain its upright position when disturbed.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID algorithm should control the motors to correct for imbalances.
- **IMU Data Acquisition:** Accurate reading and processing of IMU data (angle and gyro readings).
- **Motor Control:** Precise control of motor speeds based on the PID output.
- **Calibration:** Simple calibration routine for initial setup of the IMU and motor control.

- **Advanced Features:**  Adding a Bluetooth module for remote control.
- **Optional Feature:** Implementing a Kalman filter for improved IMU data filtering.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Calibration:** Wire the components, load necessary libraries, and calibrate the IMU to get accurate readings.
2. **IMU Data Acquisition and Processing:** Write code to read angle and gyro data from the IMU. Implement a complementary filter to combine gyro and accelerometer data for better accuracy.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller with adjustable gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).  Start with simple proportional control, then gradually add integral and derivative terms.
4. **Motor Control Implementation:** Map the PID output to the motor speeds, ensuring appropriate direction and speed control.
5. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the robot's balancing capabilities and fine-tune the PID gains for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains requires iterative testing and adjustment.  Starting with low gain values and incrementally increasing them is crucial to avoid instability.
- **IMU Noise:** Dealing with noise from the IMU is crucial.  Using a complementary filter or Kalman filter can significantly reduce this.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control concepts:** Understanding the theory and practical implementation of a PID controller is a core learning outcome.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:** This project strengthens skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and actuator control within the context of a real-world control problem.
