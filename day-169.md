# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple AI agent that learns to play a mini-game using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the core concepts of reinforcement learning within a constrained timeframe. The mini-game will be a simplified version of a classic game, allowing for quick implementation and experimentation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for game development and visualization)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple, deterministic mini-game environment (e.g., a simplified version of Pong or Snake).
    - An AI agent that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function.
    - An implementation of a Q-learning algorithm (or a simplified variation).
    - Basic training loop to improve agent performance over time.
    - Visualization of the game and the agent's actions.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Incorporating an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
    - Implementing a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Environment:** Create a basic Pygame environment for the chosen mini-game.  Focus on minimal features to keep the scope manageable.
2. **Agent Architecture:** Design a simple neural network (e.g., a feedforward network) using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch to represent the Q-function.
3. **Q-Learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm, including reward updates and action selection.
4. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updates the Q-function, and evaluates the agent's performance.
5. **Visualization:** Add basic visualization to show the game state and the agent's actions during training.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Careful consideration of rewards and penalties is crucial for successful training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the right balance between learning rate, exploration rate, and network architecture requires experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning).
- Understanding of how to design and implement a simple AI agent using neural networks.
- Hands-on experience with Pygame for game development and visualization.
