# Automated Bug Report Summarizer

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a tool that automatically summarizes bug reports from a specified source (e.g., a GitHub repository or a Jira instance). The summarization will focus on extracting key information like the title, severity, steps to reproduce, and expected vs. actual behavior, presenting it in a concise and easily digestible format.  This is significant because it can significantly reduce the time engineers spend triaging and prioritizing bugs.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `requests` (for API interaction), `Beautiful Soup` (for HTML parsing if scraping), `transformers` (for Natural Language Processing - NLP summarization),  `langchain` (optional, for advanced chain-of-thought prompting).
- **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm),  a terminal or command prompt.  Access to a bug tracking system API (e.g., GitHub API, Jira API) is required.

## Features & Requirements

- **Data Acquisition:** Fetch bug report data from a chosen source (GitHub Issues or Jira).
- **Data Parsing:** Extract relevant fields (title, description, severity, steps to reproduce, etc.) from the raw data.
- **Text Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of bug reports using NLP techniques.
- **Output Formatting:** Present the summaries in a clear and structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a formatted text report).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage issues like API rate limits or data inconsistencies.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Sentiment analysis to gauge the urgency or frustration level expressed in bug reports.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Clustering similar bug reports based on their summaries to identify potential patterns or duplicates.


## Implementation Steps

1. **API Setup & Data Fetching:**  Establish connection to the chosen API (GitHub or Jira). Write code to retrieve a set of bug reports using the API's features (pagination might be necessary for large datasets).
2. **Data Parsing & Cleaning:** Parse the retrieved data, extracting key fields. Clean the text data to remove irrelevant information (e.g., HTML tags, irrelevant comments).
3. **Summarization Engine:** Utilize a pre-trained summarization model from the `transformers` library (e.g., a BART or T5 model) to generate concise summaries for each bug report.
4. **Output Generation:** Format the summaries and other extracted information into the chosen output format (JSON, CSV, etc.).
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the tool with a small sample of bug reports and refine the data extraction and summarization logic as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **API Rate Limits:**  Many APIs have rate limits, so efficient data fetching and caching strategies are crucial.
- **Data Inconsistency:** Bug report formats can be inconsistent across different platforms or even within the same platform, requiring robust parsing and error handling.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of API interaction and data parsing techniques.
- Practical experience with NLP techniques for text summarization and its application in software development workflows.
