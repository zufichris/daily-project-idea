# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified intelligent traffic light system using a reinforcement learning approach.  The goal is to optimize traffic flow at a single intersection by dynamically adjusting traffic light timings based on simulated vehicle arrival rates.  This provides a practical demonstration of reinforcement learning in a real-world context, achievable within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Gym (OpenAI Gym or a similar RL environment), Stable Baselines3 (or other RL algorithm library)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (or similar IDE)


## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Simulation:** Simulate vehicle arrivals at the intersection with adjustable parameters (arrival rate, vehicle type distribution).
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a traffic light controller using a reinforcement learning agent (e.g., a Deep Q-Network or Proximal Policy Optimization).
- **Reward Function:** Define a reward function that incentivizes minimizing wait times and maximizing throughput.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track key metrics such as average wait time, throughput, and number of stopped vehicles.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the simulation and the agent's learning progress using Matplotlib.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporate different vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses, emergency vehicles) with varying priorities.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Implement a more sophisticated intersection model (e.g., multiple lanes, turning movements).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple traffic simulation environment using Python and NumPy. Define the state space (e.g., number of vehicles in each lane), action space (traffic light timings), and reward function.
2. **Agent Training:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) from Stable Baselines3 and train the agent to optimize the reward function.  Focus on a relatively small training dataset to fit within the time constraint.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance using the defined metrics.  Experiment with different hyperparameters if necessary.
4. **Visualization:**  Create plots showing the agent's learning curve, traffic flow patterns, and performance metrics over time.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** If time permits, implement one of the advanced features (e.g., different vehicle types).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that balances conflicting objectives (e.g., minimizing wait times for all vehicles) can be challenging.  Experimentation and iteration are key.
- **Computational Cost:** Training a reinforcement learning agent can be computationally intensive.  Consider simplifying the environment or using a less computationally expensive algorithm if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:**  Gain practical experience in implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.
- **Traffic Simulation:** Develop skills in creating and evaluating a discrete event simulation, which is relevant to various fields beyond traffic control.
