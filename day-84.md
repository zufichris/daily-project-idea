# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, self-balancing robotic arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller.  The arm will utilize a PID control algorithm to maintain balance despite external disturbances. This project demonstrates fundamental control system principles within a tangible robotic application, suitable for a rapid prototyping exercise.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano or similar (ESP32 can be used for increased processing power).
* **Servo Motor:** A standard hobby servo with sufficient torque.
* **Accelerometer/Gyroscope (IMU):**  An MPU6050 or similar IMU for feedback.
* **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE (C++).
* **Libraries:** Servo.h, Wire.h (for I2C communication with IMU).
* **Tools:** Soldering iron, breadboard, jumper wires, 3D printer (optional, for a custom arm design).


## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The arm should maintain an upright position using the PID controller.
- **IMU Integration:**  Accurately read angle and angular velocity data from the IMU.
- **PID Control Implementation:** Implement a PID control loop to adjust the servo angle based on IMU readings.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Display the current angle and setpoint on a serial monitor.
- **Basic Arm Structure:** A simple arm structure can be built using readily available materials.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - **Setpoint Control:** Allow the user to set a target angle for the arm.
    - **Robustness to Disturbances:**  Testing resilience to external pushes or weight changes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU and servo motor to the microcontroller.  Calibrate the IMU and servo.
2. **IMU Data Acquisition:** Write code to read acceleration and gyroscope data from the IMU.  Implement complementary filter or Kalman filter for improved angle estimation (optional, but recommended).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID algorithm to calculate the servo's correction angle based on the error between the current angle and the desired angle (upright position).
4. **Servo Control:** Use the calculated correction angle to adjust the servo motor's position.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the arm's stability and tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **IMU Noise:**  Filtering IMU data effectively is crucial for accurate angle estimation.  Experiment with different filter techniques.
- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains requires iterative testing and adjustment.  Start with low gains and gradually increase them while observing the arm's response.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Implementation:**  Gain practical experience in designing and implementing a PID controller.
- **Embedded Systems Development:**  Enhance skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time control systems.
