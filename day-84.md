# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using a combination of voice commands and hand gestures.  The system will leverage readily available hardware and software components to demonstrate a multi-modal interface for enhanced user interaction. The significance lies in exploring the integration of different interaction modalities for a more intuitive and accessible smart home experience.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyAudio (for audio input), OpenCV (for computer vision), TensorFlow Lite (for gesture recognition), SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text).
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (or similar single-board computer), USB microphone, USB webcam.
* **Software:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, Thonny).  Pre-trained TensorFlow Lite models for hand gesture recognition are recommended.

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Increase brightness."
- **Gesture Control:** The system should recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., wave for on/off, hand up/down for brightness/speed control).
- **Appliance Integration:**  The system needs to interface with a specific smart appliance (e.g., via its API or through a direct connection to its control circuitry - simplifying this to a simulated appliance is acceptable for a 1-2 day project).
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide visual or auditory feedback to confirm commands.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle invalid commands or recognition failures.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multi-user Support:**  Identify users based on voice or facial recognition.
- **Contextual Awareness:**  The system could adjust commands based on time of day or other environmental factors.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries, connect the hardware, and test the microphone and webcam.
2. **Develop the voice control module:** Implement speech-to-text using SpeechRecognition, process the recognized commands, and translate them into appliance control actions.
3. **Develop the gesture recognition module:** Load a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for hand gesture recognition, capture webcam frames, process them to detect gestures, and translate the recognized gestures into appliance control actions.
4. **Integrate voice and gesture control:** Combine both modules to allow for either voice or gesture-based control.
5. **Implement appliance control and feedback:** Connect to the smart appliance and send control commands, then display feedback to the user.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of speech and gesture recognition:**  Real-world environments can introduce noise and variations that may affect recognition accuracy.  Consider using robust error handling and possibly exploring techniques to improve accuracy (e.g., voice activity detection, pre-processing for gesture detection).
- **Hardware limitations:**  The processing power of the Raspberry Pi might limit real-time performance, particularly with complex gesture recognition models. Consider simplifying the model or optimizing the code to improve efficiency.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multi-modal interaction design:** This project reinforces the principles of designing user interfaces that leverage multiple input methods for improved usability and accessibility.
- **Integration of different software libraries:** This project provides practical experience in integrating various libraries (speech recognition, computer vision, machine learning) for a complex application.
