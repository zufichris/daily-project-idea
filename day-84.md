# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview
This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection, incorporating AI-driven traffic light control to optimize traffic flow. The simulation will focus on a single intersection with multiple lanes and will prioritize minimizing average wait times for vehicles.  This project is suitable for a daily challenge as it allows for a functional prototype with room for expansion.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computations), a simple queue data structure.
- Tools: A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Vehicle Generation:**  Simulate vehicles randomly appearing at the intersection's entry points with varying speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light system that cycles through green, yellow, and red signals.
- **Vehicle Movement:** Simulate vehicle movement across the intersection, adhering to traffic signals and avoiding collisions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track average wait times for vehicles at each lane.
- **Visualization:** Display the simulation in a simple graphical interface using Pygame.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a simple AI algorithm (e.g., a rule-based system or a very basic Q-learning approach) to dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on real-time traffic density.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Add vehicle types (cars, trucks, emergency vehicles) with different movement behaviors and priorities.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Basic Structure:** Create the Pygame window, define vehicle classes (position, speed, etc.), and set up the basic traffic light cycle.
2. **Vehicle Generation and Movement:** Implement vehicle generation at random intervals and movement logic, ensuring they stop at red lights.
3. **Traffic Light Control (Basic):** Implement a fixed-time traffic light cycle.
4. **Performance Tracking:** Implement a mechanism to track and display average wait times.
5. **Visualization Enhancement (Optional):** Improve the visual representation of vehicles and traffic lights.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Collision Detection:**  Ensuring vehicles don't collide requires careful management of their positions and speeds.  A simple bounding box collision detection method can be sufficient for a basic prototype.
- **AI Implementation (Optional):**  If attempting the optional AI feature, starting with a rule-based system (e.g., prioritizing the lane with the longest queue) is recommended before moving to more complex reinforcement learning techniques.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce object-oriented programming:** Design and implement classes for vehicles and traffic lights.
- **Practice event-driven programming:**  Handle user input and real-time updates within the Pygame framework.
