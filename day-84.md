# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a lightweight, real-time micro-gesture recognition model.  The system will interpret simple hand gestures captured by a webcam to trigger specific actions within a simulated smart home environment. This is significant because it explores a more intuitive and accessible alternative to traditional voice or touch-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model deployment)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, Computer (sufficient processing power)
* **Software:** Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Capture:** Capture and process webcam feed for hand gesture detection.
- **Gesture Classification:**  Recognize predefined gestures (e.g., wave for lights on/off, thumbs-up for temperature increase, thumbs-down for decrease).
- **Simulated Smart Home Response:** Simulate actions based on recognized gestures (print to console, modify virtual environment variables).
- **User Calibration (Optional):** Allow the system to adapt to individual user's hand size and movement style.
- **GUI (Optional):** Develop a basic GUI to display the recognized gesture and corresponding smart home action.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, connect the webcam, and test the basic webcam feed using OpenCV.
2. **Gesture Detection & Feature Extraction:** Utilize MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect hand landmarks and extract relevant features (distances, angles).  Focus on 2-3 easily distinguishable gestures initially.
3. **Gesture Classification (Simple Model):** Implement a simple classification algorithm (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, simple decision tree) based on the extracted features.
4. **Smart Home Simulation:** Create a basic simulation representing smart home devices (lights, thermostat).  Connect the classifier output to trigger changes in this simulation.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various hand gestures and adjust parameters (e.g., thresholds, model parameters) to improve accuracy and responsiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to Noise:**  Handling variations in lighting conditions, hand position, and background clutter will be challenging.  Careful feature selection and potentially adding image preprocessing techniques will be crucial.
- **Real-time Performance:** Ensuring smooth, lag-free operation in real-time will require optimization of the algorithm and potentially leveraging hardware acceleration (GPU).

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  Gain hands-on experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and pose estimation.
- **Development of a Simple Machine Learning Model:**  Strengthen understanding of classification algorithms and their application in a practical context.
