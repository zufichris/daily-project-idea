#  Miniature Robot Obstacle Avoidance with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a miniature robot capable of autonomously navigating a simple obstacle course using a lightweight machine learning model for object detection.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating basic computer vision and robotics integration. This is significant as it demonstrates core concepts applicable to larger-scale autonomous navigation systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico (or similar)
* **Robotics Framework:** CircuitPython (for Pico) or a similar lightweight framework.
* **Machine Learning Library:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
* **Sensors:**  Small ultrasonic sensor(s) or a low-resolution camera module.
* **Motors:** Two small DC motors with motor driver.
* **Chassis:** A small, readily available robot chassis kit.

## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Detection:** The robot should detect obstacles within a certain range using the chosen sensor.
- **Motor Control:** The robot should be able to move forward, backward, and turn using its motors.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Upon detecting an obstacle, the robot should alter its course to avoid it.
- **Simple Navigation:** The robot should be able to navigate a simple pre-defined path, even with obstacles.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record sensor readings and motor commands for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Assemble the robot chassis, connect the sensors and motors to the microcontroller, and install the necessary libraries.
2. **Sensor Integration:** Write code to read data from the ultrasonic sensor (or capture images from the camera).
3. **Basic Motor Control:** Implement functions to control the robot's movement (forward, backward, turning).
4. **Obstacle Avoidance Logic:** Develop a simple algorithm based on sensor readings to trigger avoidance maneuvers.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the robot on a simple obstacle course and refine the algorithm for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:** Ultrasonic sensors can be prone to noise; implementing filtering techniques to improve accuracy may be necessary.
- **Computational Constraints:** Microcontrollers have limited processing power; optimizing the machine learning model and algorithm is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Reinforces skills in microcontroller programming and interfacing with peripherals.
- **Basic Robotics and Computer Vision:** Develops practical experience integrating sensors, actuators, and basic machine learning for robotic control.
