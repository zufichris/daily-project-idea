# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi and a readily available USB camera. The system will identify and track specific objects within the camera's field of view, providing valuable insights into object movement and behavior. This is a miniaturized version of a larger system that could be used in surveillance, robotics, or automated systems.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB webcam, power supply.
* **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (for model inference), potentially a lightweight object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD).


## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  The system should accurately detect predefined objects (e.g., a red ball, a person) within the camera's view.
- **Object Tracking:** The system must track the detected object's position frame-by-frame, providing continuous location data (x, y coordinates).
- **Real-time Performance:** The processing and tracking should occur in real-time, with minimal latency.
- **Visual Output:** The system should display the video feed with bounding boxes around the tracked object(s).
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the object's trajectory (x,y coordinates over time) to a file.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a user interface for selecting tracked objects or adjusting detection parameters.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integrate with a robotic arm for basic object manipulation (requires additional hardware).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary software (Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) on the Raspberry Pi.  Ensure the webcam is correctly connected and recognized.
2. **Model Selection/Download:** Choose a pre-trained lightweight object detection model compatible with TensorFlow Lite. Download and prepare it for use on the Raspberry Pi.
3. **Object Detection & Tracking Implementation:** Write a Python script using OpenCV to capture video frames, run inference using the chosen model, and implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using bounding box centroid).
4. **Visual Output:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes highlighting the tracked objects.  Overlay tracking data (e.g., coordinates) if desired.
5. **Data Logging (Optional):** Integrate code to write the object's position data to a file (e.g., CSV).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Power:** The Raspberry Pi's processing power might limit the speed and accuracy of object detection and tracking, especially with complex models.  Consider using a smaller, faster model to improve performance.
- **Model Accuracy:**  The accuracy of object detection will depend on the quality of the chosen model and the lighting/image quality.  Experimentation with different models may be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of real-time image processing:** This project strengthens practical skills in capturing, processing, and analyzing video streams in real-time.
- **Practical application of machine learning models:**  Hands-on experience integrating and deploying a pre-trained model for a specific application, understanding the constraints and limitations in resource-constrained environments.
