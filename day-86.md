# AI-Powered Smart Home Lighting Controller Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic prototype of an AI-powered smart home lighting controller that adjusts lighting based on ambient light levels and user presence. This is a practical application of computer vision and machine learning, demonstrating the integration of these technologies into a real-world system.  The prototype will focus on a single room and can be expanded later.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), TensorFlow Lite (machine learning inference), RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi interaction, if using)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi (for edge computing), LEDs or compatible smart bulbs, ambient light sensor.
* **Software:**  A suitable IDE like VS Code or PyCharm.

## Features & Requirements

- **Ambient Light Detection:**  The system detects the ambient light level using a sensor or camera.
- **Occupancy Detection:**  The system detects the presence of people in the room using motion detection or object recognition (simpler implementation might use a PIR sensor).
- **Automatic Lighting Adjustment:**  Based on light levels and occupancy, the system adjusts the brightness of the connected lights.
- **User-defined Light Profiles:**  The user can define preferred lighting settings for different times of day or activities.
- **Basic User Interface:** A simple command-line interface or a basic GUI for setting profiles and viewing sensor data.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Facial Recognition:**  The system could identify individuals and adjust lighting based on their preferences.
- **Integration with Smart Home Platform:**  Connect the controller to a platform like Home Assistant for broader integration.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Sensor Integration:** Set up the development environment, install necessary libraries, and connect/configure any hardware sensors (light sensor, PIR sensor, etc.).  If using a Raspberry Pi, ensure the GPIO pins are correctly wired.
2. **Ambient Light and Occupancy Detection:** Implement algorithms using OpenCV (or sensor data) to detect ambient light levels and occupancy. This might involve basic thresholding for a simple approach.
3. **Lighting Control Logic:**  Develop the core logic to adjust lighting brightness based on the detected light level and occupancy status. This will involve mapping sensor readings to brightness levels.
4. **User Interface (Basic):** Create a simple interface (CLI or basic GUI) for users to view sensor data and set preferred light profiles.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system under various lighting conditions and occupancy scenarios. Refine the algorithms and parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accurate Light Level Detection:** Achieving precise and consistent light level detection across different lighting conditions can be challenging. Calibration and appropriate algorithms are crucial.
- **Robust Occupancy Detection:**  False positives or negatives in occupancy detection can be problematic.  Careful consideration of algorithm choice and potential environmental factors is important.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of computer vision and machine learning techniques:** This project reinforces skills in image processing, sensor data interpretation, and applying ML models for real-time decision-making.
- **Experience with embedded systems (optional):** If using a Raspberry Pi, this project provides hands-on experience with interfacing hardware and software, and managing resource constraints.
