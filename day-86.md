# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Mobile Robot

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic real-time object detection and tracking system for a mobile robot (simulated or physical).  The goal is to enable the robot to identify and follow a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within its visual field, demonstrating fundamental computer vision and robotics concepts.  The project's significance lies in its applicability to various robotics tasks, such as autonomous navigation and object manipulation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
* **Framework (Optional):** Robot Operating System (ROS) â€“ for integration with a physical robot.  A simulator (like Gazebo) can be substituted for a physical robot.
* **Hardware (Optional):** A mobile robot platform with a camera, or a suitable camera for a desktop setup.

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** Detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using color filtering and thresholding.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across consecutive frames using techniques like Kalman filtering or simple centroid tracking.
- **Robot Control (Optional):** If using a physical robot or simulator, implement basic control commands (e.g., move forward, turn) to steer the robot towards the object.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the camera feed with bounding boxes around the detected object and tracking information (e.g., object coordinates).
- **Performance Metrics:**  Measure the object detection and tracking accuracy and speed (frames per second).

**Advanced Features:**
- Implement a more robust object detection method (e.g., using pre-trained YOLO or SSD models).
- Incorporate obstacle avoidance to ensure safe navigation while tracking the object.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) and set up the camera feed (either from a physical robot/camera or a simulated environment).
2. **Object Detection:** Implement color filtering and thresholding to isolate the target object from the background.
3. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple centroid tracker or Kalman filter to track the object's position across frames.
4. **(Optional) Robot Control:** Integrate with the robot's control system to translate the object's position into robot movement commands.
5. **Visual Feedback & Evaluation:** Display the processed video with bounding boxes and tracking information; record performance metrics.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly impact color-based object detection.  Consider using techniques like adaptive thresholding or more robust object detection methods.
- **Occlusion:** If the object is partially or fully occluded, the tracking might fail. Implementing a more sophisticated tracking algorithm or using a different detection method might improve robustness.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement of image processing techniques (color filtering, thresholding).
- Practical experience with object detection and tracking algorithms (Kalman filter or simple centroid tracking).  Understanding their trade-offs.
