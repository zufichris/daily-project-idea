#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Real-time Image Processing

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a miniature drone capable of basic autonomous obstacle avoidance using real-time image processing. The goal is to create a functional prototype that can navigate a simple obstacle course within a limited timeframe (1-2 days). This project emphasizes efficient algorithm implementation and rapid prototyping techniques.  The significance lies in demonstrating the practical application of computer vision and embedded systems in a compact, accessible format.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries as detailed below)
* **Framework:** OpenCV (for image processing)
* **Library:** NumPy (for numerical computation)
* **Hardware:**  A small, pre-built drone with camera (e.g., DJI Tello or similar), a laptop/computer for processing.
* **Optional:** A ROS (Robot Operating System) environment for more advanced control (if time allows).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Obstacle Detection:** The drone should identify obstacles (e.g., simple objects like boxes or cones) in its field of view.
- **Distance Estimation:** The system should estimate the distance to detected obstacles to avoid collisions.
- **Basic Navigation:**  The drone should alter its trajectory to avoid detected obstacles based on distance.
- **Control Interface:** A simple user interface (e.g., terminal commands) for starting and stopping the autonomous navigation.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the drone's flight path and obstacle detection data for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Set up the drone camera feed, calibrate the camera (if necessary), and implement image preprocessing (e.g., noise reduction, color thresholding) to isolate obstacles from the background.
2. **Obstacle Detection:** Implement an object detection algorithm (e.g., simple contour detection or a pre-trained model like YOLOv5 for a more advanced approach, possibly simplified to detect only a specific color).
3. **Distance Estimation:** Use features like perspective transformation or known object sizes to estimate distances to detected obstacles.
4. **Navigation Control:** Implement basic control logic to alter the drone's movement based on the detected obstacles and their distances.  This could involve simple steering commands.
5. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the image processing, distance estimation, and control modules, then test the system on a small obstacle course.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:** Real-time processing on a limited-resource platform (the drone's onboard processor or even a laptop depending on the chosen drone) might be challenging.  Consider algorithm optimization techniques.
- **Accuracy of Distance Estimation:**  Simple methods might lack precision.  Sophisticated depth sensors or more advanced image processing techniques could be considered if time permits, though may increase project complexity.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with real-time image processing:** This project reinforces understanding of image processing pipelines, object detection techniques, and their application in robotics.
- **Integration of computer vision and embedded systems:**  The project highlights the challenges and strategies involved in combining computer vision algorithms with robotic control systems.
