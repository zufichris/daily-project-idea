# Self-Balancing Robot PID Controller Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated or physical self-balancing two-wheeled robot.  The goal is to achieve stable balancing and controlled movement using a simple PID algorithm, demonstrating a fundamental control system concept in robotics.  This is a valuable exercise in understanding the interplay between control theory and practical implementation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID control and potentially simulation), Pygame (for visualization â€“ optional, but highly recommended)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino or similar microcontroller, motor drivers, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), robot chassis.  A pre-built balancing robot kit can simplify hardware setup.


## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain its upright position when disturbed.
- **PID Controller Implementation:**  A functioning PID controller should be implemented and tuned.
- **Setpoint Control (Optional):**  Allow the user to set a target angle (beyond just maintaining vertical).
- **Data Logging (Advanced):** Record sensor data and controller output for analysis.
- **Visualization (Advanced):**  Display robot state (angle, velocity, etc.) graphically using Pygame or a similar library.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Simulation/Hardware Connection:** If using simulation, set up a simple physics model (e.g., using Pygame). If using hardware, connect the IMU, motors, and microcontroller.
2. **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Read angle and angular velocity data from the IMU (or simulated equivalent).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID algorithm.  Start with simple proportional control and iteratively add integral and derivative terms.
4. **Tuning:** Experiment with PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to optimize stability and responsiveness. Use trial and error or more advanced tuning techniques like Ziegler-Nichols.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the controller under various conditions (e.g., disturbances, different setpoints). Refine PID gains as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustment. Understanding the impact of each gain (Kp, Ki, Kd) is crucial.
- **Sensor Noise:**  Real-world IMU data is noisy.  Consider implementing filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) to improve stability.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of PID control algorithms and their parameters.
- **Control System Design:**  It provides practical experience in designing and implementing a basic control system for a dynamic system.
