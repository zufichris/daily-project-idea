# Real-time Object Recognition and Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a system that uses a Raspberry Pi and a camera to perform real-time object recognition and tracking. The system will identify a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view and track its movement, displaying its coordinates and potentially other relevant data on the screen. This project is significant as it showcases fundamental computer vision techniques applicable in various fields, including robotics, surveillance, and autonomous systems.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (with camera module), Monitor
* **Optional:** TensorFlow Lite (for improved object recognition speed and accuracy)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:**  The system should capture video from the Raspberry Pi camera continuously.
- **Object Detection:** The system should accurately detect a pre-defined object within the video stream.  Simple color-based detection can be used initially.
- **Object Tracking:** The system should track the detected object's position (x,y coordinates) and display them on the screen.
- **Coordinate Display:** Real-time display of the object's coordinates (x, y) on the screen overlayed on the video.
- **Data Logging (Optional):**  Record the object's trajectory (x, y coordinates over time).

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Implement more robust object recognition using a pre-trained model (e.g., from TensorFlow Lite) instead of simple color-based detection.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Integrate a simple motor control mechanism (if a robotic arm or platform is available) to make the system follow the detected object.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) on the Raspberry Pi. Configure the camera module and test video capture.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a simple color thresholding algorithm to detect the pre-defined object. This involves converting the video frames to HSV color space and filtering based on hue, saturation, and value ranges.
3. **Object Tracking:**  Use OpenCV's `cv2.minEnclosingCircle` or similar functions to find the center of the detected object and track its movement frame-by-frame. Display the coordinates on the screen using `cv2.putText`.
4. **Data Logging (Optional):** If implementing data logging, write the (x,y) coordinates to a file at regular intervals.
5. **Refinement (Optional):**  If time permits, integrate a pre-trained model for improved object detection or add the motor control functionality for object following.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Object occlusion:**  The system might struggle if the object is temporarily obscured.  Solutions include using more robust object recognition methods or employing Kalman filtering to predict object position during occlusion.
- **Lighting conditions:** Changes in lighting might affect the accuracy of color-based object detection.  Consider using more advanced techniques like adaptive thresholding or working in a controlled lighting environment.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of image processing and computer vision fundamentals.
- Gain practical experience in using OpenCV for real-time video processing and object tracking on a resource-constrained device like a Raspberry Pi.
