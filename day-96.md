# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic self-balancing robot control system using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The goal is to create a simple robot that can maintain its upright position, demonstrating a fundamental control algorithm commonly used in robotics and automation.  This project emphasizes practical application and tuning of a PID controller within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries like NumPy and Pygame for visualization, or equivalent for your preferred hardware interface)
* **Microcontroller (Optional but Recommended):** Arduino Uno or similar (for physical implementation); otherwise, simulation can be used.
* **Sensors (Optional but Recommended):** MPU6050 IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for angle and angular velocity readings.
* **Actuators (Optional but Recommended):** Two servo motors for balancing.
* **Software:**  A suitable IDE (like Arduino IDE or VS Code with Python extension).

## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain its upright position when disturbed.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A functional PID controller should be implemented to regulate the robot's balance.
- **Angle Reading and Feedback:** Accurate angle reading from the IMU (or simulated angle) should be fed back to the controller.
- **Actuator Control:** Servo motors (or simulated actuators) should respond to the controller's output, adjusting the robot's position.
- **Basic Visualization:**  A simple visualization (e.g., using Pygame or a similar library) showing the robot's angle and motor commands.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Calibration routine for IMU; implementation of different PID tuning algorithms (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Adding a user interface for real-time PID gain adjustment.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Simulation:** If using physical hardware, connect the IMU and servo motors.  Otherwise, create a simulated robot environment with angle and motor control capabilities.
2. **IMU Reading (or Simulation):** Implement the code to read angle and angular velocity data from the IMU (or generate simulated data).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement a PID controller with adjustable gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).
4. **Actuator Control:**  Use the PID controller's output to control the servo motors (or simulated actuators), adjusting their positions to maintain balance.
5. **Visualization & Testing:** Implement visualization to display the robot's angle and motor commands. Test and tune the PID gains to optimize the robot's stability.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments.  Starting with low gains and gradually increasing them is recommended.
- **Sensor Noise:** IMU readings can be noisy. Filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) might be necessary to improve accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Controller Design and Implementation:** Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning PID controllers.
- **Embedded Systems Programming (Optional):** If using physical hardware, this will reinforce embedded systems programming skills and hardware interfacing techniques.
