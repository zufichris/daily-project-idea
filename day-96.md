# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning.  The game's complexity can be adjusted to fit the time constraints, allowing for a functional prototype or a significant advancement in a short timeframe.  This project focuses on demonstrating the core concepts of reinforcement learning in a practical application.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Stable Baselines3 (or similar RL library like Ray RLlib)
- NumPy

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Create a simple 2D grid-based game environment (e.g., navigating a maze, collecting items).
    - Implement a basic reward system (e.g., reward for reaching a goal, penalty for collisions).
    - Train a reinforcement learning agent (using a suitable algorithm like PPO or DQN) to play the game.
    - Visualize the agent's learning progress and performance.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implement multiple agent types or levels of difficulty.
    - Add more complex game mechanics (e.g., enemies, dynamic obstacles).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement the game environment using Gym or a custom environment.  Focus on simplicity initially, a 5x5 grid is sufficient.
2. **Agent Selection and Training:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO recommended for its ease of use and good performance) and train the agent using Stable Baselines3.  Set reasonable training parameters to avoid overly long training times. Monitor the learning curves.
3. **Evaluation and Refinement:** Evaluate the agent's performance in the game. Adjust hyperparameters or the reward function based on the agent's behavior to improve performance.
4. **Visualization:** Integrate visualization to track the agent's progress, its path in the game, and the reward obtained over time.
5. **Documentation:** Write concise documentation explaining the environment, agent, and training process.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Overfitting:** The agent might overfit to the specific training environment. Addressing this might require creating multiple variations of the game environment for testing.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm can be time-consuming. Prioritize quick experimentation and iterative improvement.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Gain practical experience in implementing and training reinforcement learning agents. This project strengthens understanding of reward functions, policy gradients, and agent-environment interaction.
- **Gym/Stable Baselines3 Proficiency:**  Develop practical skills using these libraries for building and training RL agents. This will involve manipulating environments, agents, and parameters within the framework.
