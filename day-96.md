# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Robotic Arm Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple prototype for controlling a robotic arm using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures (e.g., open hand, clenched fist, pointing finger) and map them to corresponding robotic arm movements (e.g., open gripper, close gripper, rotate wrist). This project focuses on a lightweight, real-time solution suitable for rapid prototyping.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking), pySerial (for serial communication with the robotic arm, if applicable)
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A USB webcam, a robotic arm (e.g., a small, hobbyist-level arm with serial control), a serial-to-USB adapter.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurate and responsive hand tracking using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognition of at least three distinct hand gestures.
- **Robotic Arm Control:**  Mapping recognized gestures to specific arm movements (at least gripper control).
- **User Interface:** A simple visual representation of the recognized gesture and corresponding arm action.
- **Calibration:**  Ability to calibrate gesture recognition to the user's hand.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporating additional gestures for more complex movements.
- **Optional Feature:**  Implementation of a machine learning model for improved gesture recognition accuracy and robustness.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, pySerial if needed). Set up the webcam and robotic arm (if available).
2. **Hand Tracking and Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe hand tracking to detect hand landmarks in real time. Define thresholds and logic to recognize the chosen gestures based on landmark positions.
3. **Control Mapping:**  Map recognized gestures to specific commands for the robotic arm (e.g., "open hand" -> "open gripper," "fist" -> "close gripper"). If using a robotic arm, ensure serial communication is properly configured.
4. **UI Development:** Create a simple user interface (e.g., using OpenCV's window display) to visualize the detected hand gesture and the corresponding robotic arm command.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly, adjusting thresholds and logic as needed to ensure accurate gesture recognition and reliable robotic arm control.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Hand tracking can be affected by lighting conditions and hand occlusion.  Careful consideration of thresholding and potentially noise filtering will be needed.
- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing processing speed and accuracy is crucial for real-time operation. Optimizing code and potentially using hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU) might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Computer Vision Techniques:**  Practical application of hand tracking and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Understanding of Real-time System Design:** Gain experience in building a system that needs to operate efficiently in real-time with responsiveness constraints.
