# Robotic Arm Calibration with Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to create a program that automatically calibrates the arm's end-effector position using a camera and a known target. This is crucial for ensuring accurate movement and precision in robotic applications.  A successful prototype demonstrates practical skills in integrating computer vision and robotic control systems.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, PySerial depending on the specific arm), and potentially a library for coordinate transformations (e.g., transformations).
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple one like a hobbyist arm will suffice), a USB camera, and a calibration target (e.g., a printed checkerboard pattern).


## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:**  Calibrates the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) using a checkerboard pattern.
- **Target Detection:** Detects the checkerboard pattern in the camera's image using OpenCV's functions.
- **Position Estimation:** Estimates the 3D position of the checkerboard in the camera's coordinate system.
- **Robotic Arm Control:**  Commands the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the estimated position of the checkerboard.
- **Error Minimization:** (Optional, but challenging for a 2-day timeframe) Implements a simple iterative feedback loop to refine the position accuracy.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Account for camera and robotic arm pose uncertainty.
- **Optional Feature:** Implement a user interface for easier interaction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera()` function to obtain the camera's intrinsic parameters.  This involves capturing several images of the checkerboard from different angles.
2. **Target Detection & Position Estimation:** Use OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners()` and `solvePnP()` to detect the checkerboard and estimate its 3D position relative to the camera.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Transform the checkerboard's position from the camera's coordinate system to the robot's coordinate system.  This requires knowing the transformation matrix between the two coordinate systems (which may need to be manually determined).
4. **Robotic Arm Control:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move its end-effector to the calculated position.
5. **Verification & Refinement (Optional):** Capture a new image after the arm moves and measure the error. Iterate steps 2-4 to refine the position if necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Coordinate Transformation:** Accurately determining the transformation matrix between the camera and robot coordinate systems can be challenging.  This might require careful measurement or a more sophisticated approach involving a known object placed in both coordinate systems.
- **Accuracy Limitations:**  The accuracy of the calibration will depend on the quality of the camera, the accuracy of the robot's control system, and the precision of the coordinate transformation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Techniques:**  Reinforces understanding of camera calibration, feature detection, and 3D pose estimation.
- **Robotics and Control:**  Provides hands-on experience with integrating computer vision data into a robotic control system, highlighting the challenges of coordinate transformations and error handling in robotics.
