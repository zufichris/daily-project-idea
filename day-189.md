#  Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with Webcam Feed

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet functional real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The system will identify and track a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view, displaying its location and classification on the video feed. This demonstrates core concepts in computer vision and offers a practical application of object detection and tracking algorithms.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a suitable development environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video frames from a webcam using OpenCV.
- **Object Detection:** Detect the predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in each frame using color thresholding or a pre-trained object detection model (YOLOv5, MobileNet SSD).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object across frames using techniques like optical flow or a Kalman filter.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object on the video feed, displaying its coordinates.
- **Classification Confidence:** (Optional) Display the classification confidence score for the detected object.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Initialization:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy).  Initialize the webcam and create a video capture object.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement object detection using either color thresholding (simpler for a single-color object) or load a pre-trained model (more robust and versatile).
3. **Object Tracking:** Choose a tracking algorithm (optical flow or Kalman filter) and integrate it with the detection module to track the object's position across frames.
4. **Visualization:**  Overlay bounding boxes and other relevant information (coordinates, confidence score) onto the video stream.
5. **Loop and Display:** Create a main loop to continuously capture frames, detect, track, and display the results in real-time.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially with complex object detection models.  Consider using optimized models or reducing frame rate if necessary.
- **Object Occlusion:** Dealing with situations where the object is temporarily obscured requires robust tracking algorithms capable of handling temporary loss of the target.  A Kalman filter might be useful here.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Practical application of computer vision techniques:** This project reinforces understanding of object detection, tracking, and real-time video processing.
- **Experience with OpenCV and deep learning frameworks:** Hands-on experience with these libraries builds practical skills in image processing and computer vision.
