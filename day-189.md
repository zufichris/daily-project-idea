# Robotic Arm Precision Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a quick and efficient calibration method for a robotic arm using computer vision.  Precise robotic arm control is crucial in various applications, and this project focuses on improving accuracy through automated calibration leveraging readily available tools and techniques.  The core focus will be on a single degree of freedom for simplicity within the time constraint.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm control library (depending on the specific arm used -  e.g., ROS for more complex robots, or manufacturer-specific libraries).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm with at least one degree of freedom, a camera (webcam sufficient), a calibration target (e.g., a chessboard).

## Features & Requirements
- **Target Detection:** Accurately detect the calibration target in the camera's field of view using OpenCV's feature detection algorithms.
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the target relative to the camera.
- **Arm Position Control:**  Command the robotic arm to move to a specific target position based on the pose estimation.
- **Error Calculation:**  Compute the difference between the commanded and actual end-effector position (this requires sensor feedback from the robot arm).
- **Calibration Adjustment (Optional):** Develop a basic calibration adjustment algorithm based on the calculated error.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a simple iterative calibration loop to refine the accuracy.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Explore using different camera models and lens distortion correction to improve the accuracy of pose estimation.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Target Detection:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. Implement target detection using OpenCV's feature detection (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB) and find the chessboard corners.
2. **Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV's `solvePnP` function to estimate the pose of the calibration target.
3. **Arm Control and Position Feedback:** Send commands to the robotic arm to move to calculated positions based on the estimated pose. Obtain feedback from the arm's position sensors.
4. **Error Calculation:** Compute the difference between commanded and actual arm position.  This may involve coordinate transformations based on the robot arm's kinematic model.
5. **(Optional) Calibration Adjustment:** If sufficient time remains, implement a simple algorithm to adjust the arm's control parameters based on the calculated errors.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Pose Estimation:**  The accuracy of the calibration heavily depends on the accuracy of the pose estimation.  Lighting conditions, camera calibration, and target detection can all affect this.
- **Robot Arm Control:** Understanding and properly interfacing with the robot arm's control system will be crucial.  The complexity will depend on the specific robotic arm used.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces understanding of computer vision techniques for pose estimation and object detection.
- Develops practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic arm control for precision tasks.
