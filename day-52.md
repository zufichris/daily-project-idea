# Self-Optimizing Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified traffic light simulation that can self-optimize its timing based on simulated traffic flow.  The goal is not to create a fully realistic city-scale simulation, but rather a smaller, controlled environment where the optimization algorithms can be tested and demonstrated effectively within a short timeframe.  This allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different optimization techniques.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for visualization), potentially SciPy (for optimization algorithms if time allows).
- **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Traffic Generation:**  Simulate vehicles entering the intersection from multiple directions with adjustable arrival rates.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a basic traffic light controller with adjustable cycle times for each phase (e.g., North-South, East-West).
- **Performance Measurement:** Track metrics such as average waiting time, total stopped time, and throughput.
- **Optimization Algorithm (Basic):** Implement a simple optimization algorithm (e.g., a rule-based system adjusting timings based on queue length).
- **Visualization:** Create a visual representation of the intersection and traffic flow using Matplotlib.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated optimization algorithm (e.g., a genetic algorithm or reinforcement learning approach).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Add different vehicle types with varying speeds and priorities.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Simulation Setup:** Create classes to represent vehicles, traffic lights, and the intersection. Implement basic traffic generation and movement without optimization.
2. **Performance Measurement:** Add code to track and display key performance metrics (average waiting time, etc.).
3. **Rule-Based Optimization:** Implement a simple rule-based system that adjusts traffic light timings based on queue length thresholds.
4. **Visualization:**  Implement visualization to show traffic flow and traffic light states.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Run the simulation with various parameters and adjust the rule-based system to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Balancing the complexity of the optimization algorithm with the time constraints of the daily challenge.  Starting with a simple approach and iteratively improving is crucial.
- **Simulation Accuracy:**  The simulation is simplified; factors like vehicle acceleration, turning movements, and pedestrian traffic are omitted for brevity.  Focusing on core optimization principles is paramount.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of simulation techniques:**  This project provides hands-on experience in building and evaluating a discrete event simulation.
- **Practical application of optimization algorithms:**  Experimenting with different optimization strategies enhances the understanding of their strengths and weaknesses within a constrained context.
