# AI-Powered Bug Report Triage System Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to build a basic prototype of an AI-powered system that can triage bug reports based on severity and priority.  This is significant because it can automate a time-consuming and often subjective process in software development, freeing up developers to focus on fixing bugs rather than categorizing them.  The focus will be on a minimal viable product that demonstrates core functionality.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  spaCy (for NLP), scikit-learn (for machine learning - specifically, a simple classifier), Flask (for a basic web interface - optional).
* **Tools:**  A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), Python interpreter.  Optionally, a local web server.

## Features & Requirements

- **Bug Report Input:**  The system should accept bug reports as text input (either manually entered or via a file upload).
* **Severity Classification:**  The system should classify bug reports into severity levels (e.g., critical, major, minor, trivial) using a pre-trained or quickly trained machine learning model.
* **Priority Assignment:**  The system should assign a priority level (e.g., high, medium, low) based on the severity and possibly other factors (e.g., frequency of occurrence â€“ if data is available).
* **Output Display:** The system should display the classified bug report with its assigned severity and priority.
* **Basic Data Persistence:** Store processed bug reports (at least for the session).


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Integrate with a bug tracking system API (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) for direct report creation and update.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple user interface using Flask or a similar framework.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation:** Gather a small dataset of sample bug reports (even 20-30 well-labelled examples can be enough for a basic prototype) with pre-assigned severity and priority labels.
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple text classification model (e.g., using scikit-learn's Naive Bayes or a simple Logistic Regression) on the prepared dataset to classify bug reports based on severity.
3. **Severity & Priority Assignment Logic:**  Implement the logic to assign priority based on the predicted severity.  A simple rule-based system is sufficient for the prototype.
4. **Input and Output Handling:** Create a basic function to take bug report input (from console or file), run the model prediction, and display the results.
5. **(Optional) UI Development:** If time permits, create a basic web interface using Flask to allow for easier input and output.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Scarcity:**  A small dataset might lead to a less accurate model.  Focus on selecting high-quality, representative examples.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model and training parameters efficiently requires experience. Start with a simple, fast-to-train model like Naive Bayes.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques:** The project provides hands-on experience with text classification.
- **Gain experience in building a simple machine learning pipeline:** From data preparation to model training and deployment, the project covers the essential stages of a machine learning project.
