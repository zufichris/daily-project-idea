# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimalist game using reinforcement learning.  The game will be easily definable and the AI's learning process will be observable within a short timeframe. This demonstrates core reinforcement learning concepts and provides a practical application within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow)
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation and visualization)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -  A simple 2D grid-based game environment (e.g., a maze navigation task or a simple tile-matching game).
    -  A reinforcement learning agent (using Q-learning or a similar algorithm) that learns to navigate the environment and achieve a defined goal (e.g., reach a target location, maximize score).
    -  Basic visualization of the environment and the agent's actions.
    -  Logging of agent performance metrics (e.g., reward, steps taken).
    -  Ability to save and load the trained agent.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    -  Integration with a GUI for improved user interaction.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment using Gym or create a custom environment in Python.  This involves specifying the state space, action space, reward function, and termination conditions.
2. **Agent Development:** Implement the reinforcement learning agent using the chosen algorithm (Q-learning for simplicity). This involves defining the Q-table (or neural network for DQN) and the update rule.
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop that repeatedly runs the agent in the environment, allowing it to learn through trial and error.  Monitor the agent's performance and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
4. **Visualization & Evaluation:** Implement basic visualization to observe the agent's behavior and progress. Evaluate the agent's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Save & Load:** Implement functionality to save and load the trained agent, allowing for resuming training or testing later.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.) for the reinforcement learning algorithm might require experimentation.  Start with simple values and adjust iteratively.
- **Environment Complexity:** Balancing the simplicity of the environment with the complexity required for meaningful learning is crucial.  An overly simple environment may lead to trivial solutions, while an overly complex one might not allow for significant progress within the timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes
- Gain practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning or DQN).
- Develop skills in designing and implementing simple game AI using Python and relevant libraries.
- Understand the importance of hyperparameter tuning and its impact on reinforcement learning performance.
