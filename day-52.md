# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a tiny machine learning (TinyML) based gesture recognition system that can control simple smart home devices. The system will leverage a microcontroller with onboard machine learning capabilities to recognize a small set of predefined gestures captured by an onboard accelerometer or a simple camera module.  This demonstrates a practical application of TinyML for resource-constrained devices and showcases the potential for low-power, edge-based smart home solutions.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with onboard machine learning capabilities)
* **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE with TensorFlow Lite Micro libraries
* **Sensor:**  Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) from the Nano 33 BLE Sense or a low-resolution camera module (optional for more advanced version).
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
* **Development Environment:** Arduino IDE

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Acquisition:**  Capture accelerometer data (or image data) representing predefined gestures (e.g., waving hand, hand clap, fist).
- **Model Training:** Train a TensorFlow Lite Micro model using a suitable dataset of gesture data.  Pre-trained models can be utilized for faster prototyping.
- **Gesture Classification:** Classify incoming sensor data using the trained model.
- **Smart Home Control:**  Integrate with a simple smart home device (e.g., turning on/off an LED, controlling a small servo motor).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Perform gesture recognition and control actions in real-time with minimal latency.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Gesture Recognition:** Expand the system to recognize more complex gestures.
- **Wireless Communication:**  Transmit the recognized gestures to a central control system via BLE.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect accelerometer or image data for 3-4 distinct gestures.  Preprocess data (e.g., filtering, normalization).
2. **Model Training:** Train a TensorFlow Lite Micro model using the collected data.  Utilize a simple model architecture suitable for the microcontroller's resources (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, a small convolutional neural network if using camera).  Consider using a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it.
3. **Model Deployment:** Compile and deploy the trained model to the microcontroller.
4. **Integration with Smart Home Device:**  Implement the control logic based on the recognized gestures. This might involve controlling GPIO pins to activate devices.
5. **Testing & Refinement:**  Thoroughly test the system with various gestures and iterate based on the accuracy and performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Resource Constraints:** Microcontrollers have limited processing power and memory. Model complexity needs careful consideration.  Simplifying the model or using quantization techniques can address this.
- **Data Acquisition:** Obtaining a sufficiently large and representative dataset for training can be challenging with limited time.  Augmentation techniques could help expand the dataset.

## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Development:** Practical experience in developing and deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices.
- **Sensor Integration:**  Gain experience in integrating sensors and utilizing their data for real-time applications.
