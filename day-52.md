# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent using reinforcement learning to play a minimalist game. The game will be a custom-designed environment, focusing on a manageable state space and action set to allow for significant progress within a short timeframe. This project showcases reinforcement learning principles in a practical context.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Stable Baselines3 (or another RL library like TensorFlow Agents)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D grid-based game environment with a clear objective (e.g., navigate to a target, collect items).
    - An AI agent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
    - Basic reward system providing feedback to the agent.
    - Visualization of the agent's performance and learning process.
    - Ability to save and load trained models.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Implementing different RL algorithms for comparison.
    - Adding more complex game mechanics or environment features.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Design & Implement the Game Environment:** Create a simple game environment using OpenAI Gym or a custom class. Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Choose and Configure an RL Algorithm:** Select an appropriate RL algorithm from Stable Baselines3 (e.g., PPO). Set hyperparameters like learning rate, discount factor, and number of training steps.
3. **Train the AI Agent:** Run the training process, monitoring the agent's performance.  Experiment with hyperparameters to optimize performance.
4. **Evaluate and Visualize Results:** Assess the trained agent's performance. Plot learning curves (reward vs. training steps) to visualize the learning progress.
5. **Save and Load the Model:** Save the trained model for later use and loading to continue training or testing.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm can be time-consuming. Experimentation and iterative adjustment are key.
- **Reward Function Design:** Carefully designing a reward function that guides the agent towards the desired behavior is crucial for successful training. An improperly designed reward function can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience in implementing and applying reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Understanding of key RL concepts like state space, action space, reward functions, and policy optimization.
- Proficiency in using RL libraries like Stable Baselines3 and OpenAI Gym.
