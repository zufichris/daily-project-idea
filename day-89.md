# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a minimal game using reinforcement learning (RL).  The game will be a custom-designed, text-based environment, reducing the complexity and allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different RL algorithms.  The significance lies in demonstrating a practical application of RL in a concise timeframe and showcasing the core concepts behind training an AI agent.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Gym (OpenAI Gym), Stable Baselines3 (or similar RL library)
* **IDE:** Any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:** A simple text-based game with a clear objective (e.g., reaching a target location within a grid, collecting items).
- **RL Agent:** An agent trained using a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization).
- **Training Loop:** Implementation of a training loop to iteratively improve the agent's performance.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics to track the agent's progress during training (e.g., average reward, success rate).
- **Visualization (optional):**  Simple visualization of the game state and agent's actions.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementation of different RL algorithms for comparison.
- **Advanced Features:**  Integration with a simple GUI for a more user-friendly experience (using Pygame or similar).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Design Game Environment:** Create a Python class defining the game rules, state representation, and reward function.
2. **Choose RL Algorithm:** Select a suitable RL algorithm from Stable Baselines3 (e.g., PPO, A2C) and instantiate it.
3. **Implement Training Loop:** Write a loop that repeatedly runs the game, updates the agent's policy based on the rewards received, and tracks performance metrics.
4. **Train the Agent:** Run the training loop for a sufficient number of iterations (depending on the algorithm and game complexity).
5. **Evaluate Performance:** Analyze the collected metrics to assess the agent's learning progress and effectiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:**  Creating a reward function that effectively guides the agent towards the desired behavior can be challenging.  Experimentation and iteration will be necessary.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm can significantly impact performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:**  Gain hands-on experience with core RL concepts like reward functions, policies, and value functions.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Become proficient in using RL libraries like Stable Baselines3 for agent training and evaluation.
