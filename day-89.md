# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures performed in front of a camera to trigger specific smart home actions, like turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or pausing music. This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and machine learning in a concise timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras (optional for advanced feature)
* **Tools:** Webcam, Jupyter Notebook/IDE

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Capture:**  Capture and process video frames from a webcam in real-time.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize predefined micro-gestures (e.g., hand open/close, finger point).
- **Smart Home Action Triggering:**  Map recognized gestures to specific smart home actions (simulated for this prototype).
- **User Interface:**  Simple display showing the recognized gesture and triggered action.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where gestures are not clearly recognized.


- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Implement a simple training mechanism to personalize gesture recognition based on user data.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Integrate with a real smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant) to control actual devices.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe). Set up a test environment with a webcam and Jupyter Notebook/IDE.
2. **Gesture Capture & Preprocessing:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to capture hand landmarks from the webcam feed.  Preprocess the data (e.g., normalize coordinates).
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Develop a simple logic (e.g., distance between landmarks) to classify predefined gestures.  For a more advanced approach, a simple machine learning model (TensorFlow/Keras) can be trained.
4. **Action Triggering:**  Implement a mapping between recognized gestures and simulated smart home actions (print statements to console initially).
5. **UI Development:** Create a basic visual display (e.g., using OpenCV's window) to show the recognized gesture and triggered action.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing speed and accuracy can be challenging.  Careful consideration of image processing and gesture recognition algorithms is crucial.
- **Gesture Variability:**  Dealing with variations in hand size, lighting conditions, and user performance requires robust preprocessing and classification techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Gain experience with real-time video processing, hand landmark detection, and feature extraction.
- **Prototyping and Iteration:** Develop practical skills in rapidly prototyping and iterating on a project with limited resources and time constraints.
