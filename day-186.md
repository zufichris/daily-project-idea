# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet functional real-time object detection and tracking system using a webcam, leveraging the power of WebRTC for browser-based implementation.  The significance lies in demonstrating the feasibility of integrating complex computer vision tasks directly within a web application, opening possibilities for interactive applications in areas like augmented reality and remote monitoring.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries below) and JavaScript (for WebRTC integration).
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (Python), TensorFlow Lite (for object detection - pre-trained model), WebRTC JavaScript API.
* **Tools:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code), a webcam, and a web browser.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect a predefined set of objects (e.g., person, car, bicycle) from webcam feed using a lightweight, pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model.
- **Object Tracking:** Track detected objects across frames, providing continuous identification and bounding box updates.
- **WebRTC Streaming:** Stream the webcam feed and the overlaid detection results to a web browser in real-time.
- **Display Overlays:** Display bounding boxes and object labels directly on the video stream in the browser.
- **Frame Rate Optimization:** Aim for a reasonably high frame rate (at least 10 FPS) to ensure smooth operation.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Server-Side Processing:** Implement a server to handle the object detection, allowing for client-side offloading.
- **Multiple Object Tracking:**  Adapt the system to handle multiple objects simultaneously.



## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) and configure a WebRTC server (simple one might suffice for this).
2. **Object Detection Pipeline:** Integrate a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model into an OpenCV pipeline for real-time object detection.
3. **WebRTC Integration:** Implement WebRTC client and server to stream webcam feed along with bounding boxes and object labels from Python to the browser.
4. **Browser-side Display:** Create a simple HTML/JavaScript application to receive and display the WebRTC stream with the overlaid detection results.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different objects and lighting conditions. Optimize frame rate through model selection or hardware acceleration.



## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:** Balancing real-time processing speed with accuracy and minimizing latency. The model selection is crucial here. A lightweight model is essential for near real-time performance.
- **WebRTC Implementation:**  Dealing with potential network issues and browser compatibility.  Focus on a simpler WebRTC implementation.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Hands-on experience with integrating computer vision techniques into a live application.
- **WebRTC Integration:**  Understanding and implementing real-time video streaming using WebRTC.
