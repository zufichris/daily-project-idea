# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a rudimentary self-balancing robotic arm using a single servo motor and a microcontroller.  The focus will be on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain the arm's balance against external disturbances.  This provides a practical, hands-on exercise in control systems engineering within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano or similar
- Servo Motor:  Standard hobby servo (e.g., SG90)
- Accelerometer/Gyroscope (IMU): MPU6050 or similar
- Programming Language: C++ (Arduino IDE)
- Software Libraries:  Arduino Servo library, MPU6050 library
- Hardware: Breadboard, jumper wires, power supply


## Features & Requirements
- **Basic Balance:** The arm should maintain an upright position using the PID controller.
- **Response to Disturbances:** The system should react and recover from small external pushes or taps.
- **Angle Measurement:** Accurate reading of the arm's angle from the IMU sensor.
- **PID Tuning:**  Implementation of a PID controller with adjustable gains (P, I, D).
- **Real-time Feedback:** The arm's angle and control signal should be displayed serially (e.g., to the serial monitor).

- **Advanced Features:**  Adding a visual feedback mechanism (e.g., an LED indicating balance status).
- **Optional Feature:**  Implementation of a simple user interface to adjust PID gains in real time.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the servo motor, IMU, and power supply to the microcontroller according to the datasheets.
2. **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the IMU to obtain accurate angle readings.
3. **PID Implementation:** Write the C++ code to read IMU data, implement the PID algorithm, and send control signals to the servo motor.
4. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the arm's balance and tune the PID gains (P, I, D) to optimize performance and stability.
5. **Data Visualization:**  Display the arm's angle and control signal in the serial monitor for analysis and debugging.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gain values can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with low gain values and gradually increase them while observing the system's response.
- **Sensor Noise:** IMU data may be noisy, requiring filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) to improve accuracy.


## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control:** This project reinforces understanding of PID controllers and their implementation in a real-world system.
- **Sensor Integration:**  It strengthens skills in integrating sensor data into control algorithms and managing sensor noise.
