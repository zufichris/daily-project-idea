# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a standard webcam. The system will translate simple hand gestures into commands to control smart devices (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume). This is significant because it provides a hands-free and intuitive interaction method for smart home environments, particularly beneficial for individuals with limited mobility.  The focus will be on building a functional prototype, not a fully polished product.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition),  PyAutoGUI (for simulating keyboard/mouse input)
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a suitable development environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Detection:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., open hand, closed fist, pointing finger) with reasonable accuracy.
- **Command Mapping:** Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home command (e.g., open hand = "turn lights on", closed fist = "turn lights off", pointing finger = "increase volume").
- **Real-time Processing:** Process the webcam feed in real-time to provide a responsive user experience.
- **Output to Smart Home System:** Simulate sending commands to a smart home system using PyAutoGUI (e.g., simulating key presses or mouse clicks to control a virtual smart home interface or even a simplified local simulation).
- **Basic User Interface (Optional):** A simple window displaying the recognized gesture and the corresponding command.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a calibration process to adjust gesture recognition sensitivity based on the user and lighting conditions.  Explore alternative input methods like a depth camera for improved robustness.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment and Libraries:** Install Python and the necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI).
2. **Implement Gesture Recognition:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track hand gestures from the webcam feed.
3. **Map Gestures to Commands:** Create a mapping between recognized gestures and corresponding smart home control commands.  Implement the command execution using PyAutoGUI.
4. **Build the User Interface (Optional):** Create a basic GUI to display the recognized gestures and the executed commands using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and lighting conditions, making adjustments to the gesture recognition parameters as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Hand gesture recognition can be sensitive to lighting, background clutter, and hand positioning. Addressing this requires careful tuning of MediaPipe parameters and potentially employing image preprocessing techniques.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy with real-time processing can be challenging.  Optimization techniques might be needed to ensure smooth performance.


## Learning Outcomes

This project reinforces practical skills in computer vision, specifically utilizing MediaPipe for real-time gesture recognition, and the application of those skills to build an interactive system.  It also provides experience with working with external libraries and integrating them effectively to achieve a specific outcome.  The optional GUI development enhances UI/UX design concepts and application.
