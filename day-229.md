# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will focus on simple, intuitive gestures to control basic smart home functionalities, such as turning lights on/off or adjusting volume. This offers a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional voice or app-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), PyAutoGUI (GUI automation)
* **Hardware:** Webcam, (optional) Raspberry Pi for deployment.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  The system should accurately detect predefined hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up/down, wave, fist) from a webcam feed in real-time.
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Detected gestures should trigger pre-defined actions, such as turning lights on/off or adjusting the volume of a connected device.  (Simulate with on-screen actions for a quick prototype)
- **User Calibration:**  Allow for quick user calibration to adjust the model's sensitivity to individual hand sizes and movement styles.
- **GUI:**  A simple GUI to display the recognized gestures and allow for configuration of the gesture-action mappings.
- **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.

**Advanced Features (Optional):**

- **Multiple User Support:**  Ability to differentiate between multiple users based on their hand shapes/sizes.
- **Gesture Training:**  Allow for users to train new gestures through a simple training process.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment & Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI).
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe's hand tracking model. Focus on a subset of 2-3 distinct gestures.
3. **Action Mapping:** Create a mapping between detected gestures and desired smart home actions (e.g., thumbs up = turn light on, thumbs down = turn light off).  Simulate actions using PyAutoGUI for this prototype.
4. **GUI Development:** Create a simple GUI (using Tkinter or similar) to display the recognized gestures and allow users to configure the gesture-action mappings.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system with various lighting conditions and hand movements, adjusting parameters as needed to improve accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition, especially with varying lighting and hand positions, can be challenging. Consider using pre-processing techniques to improve image quality.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Processing the webcam feed in real-time requires efficient code and potentially optimization techniques to maintain a smooth frame rate.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of computer vision techniques:**  Gain hands-on experience with real-time image processing and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Developing a responsive and intuitive user interface:**  Learn to design and implement a simple yet effective GUI for controlling a complex system.
