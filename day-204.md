# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately determine the end-effector's (the robotic arm's "hand") position and orientation in 3D space using a camera and image processing techniques.  This is crucial for precise robotic manipulation tasks.  The scope will be limited to a single point calibration, focusing on accuracy and speed of implementation within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), NumPy (for numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, specific manufacturer's library if available).
* **Hardware:**  A robotic arm (even a simulated one will suffice), a calibrated camera (or simulated camera feed), a checkerboard or other calibration target.


## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:**  Determine intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters (focal length, principal point, camera pose relative to the robot's base). This can be simplified by assuming known camera parameters for this rapid prototype.
- **Target Detection:** Detect the calibration target (e.g., checkerboard) in the camera image using OpenCV's feature detection and matching algorithms.
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the calibration target relative to the camera.
- **Robot Arm Position Control:**  Command the robotic arm to move to a pre-defined set of positions (can be simplified to a single position for this project).
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Transform the camera coordinates of the target to the robot's coordinate system.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement iterative refinement of the calibration using multiple calibration points.
- **Optional Feature:**  Visualize the calibration results using a 3D plot.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries, connect to the robotic arm and camera, and load the calibration target image.  If using a simulator, set up the simulation environment.
2. **Target Detection & Pose Estimation:** Use OpenCV to detect the calibration target and estimate its pose using functions like `cv2.findChessboardCorners` and `cv2.solvePnP`.
3. **Robot Arm Control:**  Move the robotic arm to a known position. Capture an image.
4. **Coordinate Transformation:**  Transform the target's coordinates from the camera frame to the robot's base frame.  This might require a pre-defined transformation matrix or could be a simplification based on a known relative position.
5. **Calibration Validation (Optional):** Move the robot to a few additional points and verify the accuracy of the calibration.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Pose Estimation:**  Accurate pose estimation is crucial, and noise in the image can significantly affect the results. Consider using robust methods and filtering techniques.
- **Coordinate System Transformations:**  Correctly transforming coordinates between camera and robot frames requires careful attention to coordinate systems and transformation matrices.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:**  Specifically, camera calibration, feature detection, and pose estimation.
- **Gain experience with robotic arm control and coordinate transformations:**  Understanding the interplay between computer vision and robotics.
