# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to design and implement a simple self-balancing robotic arm using a single servo motor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The goal is to demonstrate a basic implementation of PID control for stabilizing the arm in an upright position, despite external disturbances. This project is suitable for showcasing a practical application of control systems in robotics within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework/Library:**  Pygame (for visualization, optional),  `smbus` or similar I2C library (for IMU communication)
- **Hardware:**  Arduino Nano (or similar microcontroller), Servo Motor, MPU6050 IMU (or similar), Breadboard, Jumper wires, Power Supply.
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements
- **IMU Data Acquisition:** Read and process accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050.
- **PID Control Implementation:**  Design and implement a PID controller to stabilize the arm based on the IMU data.
- **Servo Motor Control:**  Use the PID controller output to drive the servo motor, adjusting its position to maintain balance.
- **Basic Stabilization:** Maintain the arm upright against minor external disturbances (e.g., gently tapping the base).
- **Data Visualization (Optional):** Display the sensor data and controller output in real-time using Pygame.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a simple user interface to adjust PID gains in real time. Implement a setpoint adjustment to control target arm angle.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU, Servo motor, and Arduino according to datasheets. Verify connections by testing sensor output and servo motor movement.
2. **IMU Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Write Arduino code to read raw data from the IMU and perform basic calibration (optional, but recommended for accuracy).  Send processed data (angle and angular velocity) to the computer via serial communication.
3. **PID Controller Implementation (Python):** Implement a PID controller algorithm in Python to receive sensor data, calculate control signals, and send commands to the servo.
4. **Servo Control (Arduino):** Write Arduino code to receive commands from Python and control the servo motor based on received data.
5. **Testing & Tuning:** Test the system, adjust PID gains to achieve optimal stability and responsiveness.  This requires iterative testing and fine-tuning.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Calibration:**  Accurate IMU calibration is crucial for stable performance.  Consider using a calibration routine to compensate for sensor biases and drifts.
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative experimentation.  Techniques like Ziegler-Nichols method can be used to expedite this process.


## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Control:**  Gain practical experience in implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental control algorithm in robotics and automation.
- **Embedded Systems Integration:** Strengthen understanding of interfacing embedded systems (Arduino) with higher-level programming languages (Python) for real-time control applications.
