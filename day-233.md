# TinyML-Powered Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a tiny machine learning (TinyML) based gesture recognition system controlling a smart home device (e.g., a smart lamp).  The system uses a microcontroller with onboard machine learning capabilities to recognize simple hand gestures, eliminating the need for cloud connectivity and improving privacy and responsiveness.  This is a significant advancement over traditional methods requiring substantial processing power.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with built-in sensor and ML capabilities).
* **Programming Language:** Arduino C++
* **Machine Learning Library:** TensorFlow Lite Micro
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE
* **Sensor Data Acquisition:**  Inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope.
* **Optional:** A small servo motor to demonstrate control of a physical device.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Acquisition:** Capture accelerometer and gyroscope data from hand gestures (e.g., wave, clap, fist).
- **Model Training:** Train a simple TensorFlow Lite Micro model to classify these gestures.  Pre-trained models can be adapted for rapid prototyping.
- **Real-time Classification:**  Use the trained model on the microcontroller to classify incoming sensor data in real-time.
- **Output Control:** Trigger a specific action based on the classified gesture (e.g., turning a smart lamp on/off).
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Log gesture data for further model improvement.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect accelerometer and gyroscope data for each gesture. Preprocess this data (e.g., smoothing, windowing).
2. **Model Training:** Use a simple model architecture (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors or a small convolutional neural network) within TensorFlow Lite Micro to train a classification model on the collected data.  Explore existing models for immediate use.
3. **Model Deployment:** Convert and deploy the trained model to the microcontroller.
4. **Real-time Inference:** Implement the real-time gesture recognition on the microcontroller, using the deployed model to classify incoming sensor data.
5. **Control Integration:** Integrate the classification output with a smart home device simulator (or actual hardware, if available) to control its state.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:** Ensuring sufficient and varied data for accurate model training. This might require careful data augmentation techniques.
- **Model Optimization:** Balancing model accuracy and resource constraints (memory and processing power) on the microcontroller. Model quantization and pruning techniques might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML workflow:** Gain hands-on experience with the entire TinyML pipeline, from data collection to deployment and real-time inference.
- **Embedded systems programming:** Enhance skills in embedded systems programming and interfacing with sensors and actuators on a microcontroller.
