# Robotic Arm Calibration with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified machine learning model for calibrating a robotic arm's end-effector position.  Precise calibration is crucial for robotic accuracy, and this project will focus on creating a quick calibration routine using a small dataset, suitable for rapid prototyping and testing within a day or two.  The goal is to improve the accuracy of the arm's movements without requiring extensive manual calibration processes.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Scikit-learn (for regression models), possibly OpenCV (for image processing if using visual feedback)
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm with accessible positional data (e.g., Arduino-controlled arm, simulated robotic arm environment),  a measuring device (e.g., ruler, laser rangefinder - optional for higher accuracy).

## Features & Requirements

- **Data Acquisition:** Collect a small dataset of target positions and corresponding robotic arm joint angles.
- **Model Training:** Train a simple regression model (e.g., linear regression, support vector regression) to predict end-effector position from joint angles.
- **Calibration Function:** Create a function that uses the trained model to predict joint angles needed to reach a desired end-effector position.
- **Accuracy Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's accuracy using a separate test dataset or by comparing predicted and actual positions.
- **Basic User Interface:** (Optional) Create a simple command-line interface to input target coordinates and receive predicted joint angles.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Manually move the robotic arm to several known positions, recording the target (x, y, z) coordinates and corresponding joint angles for each position. Aim for at least 20-30 data points.
2. **Model Training:** Use Scikit-learn to train a regression model (e.g., LinearRegression) on the collected dataset.  The joint angles will be the input features, and the (x, y, z) coordinates will be the target variables.
3. **Calibration Function Development:** Write a function that takes desired (x, y, z) coordinates as input and uses the trained model to predict the required joint angles.
4. **Accuracy Testing:** Test the calibration function by comparing the predicted positions with actual positions achieved by the robot arm for new target coordinates not included in the training dataset.
5. **(Optional) UI Integration:** If time allows, create a simple user interface (e.g., a command-line program) that allows users to specify target coordinates and view the predicted joint angles.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:** Inaccurate data collection can significantly impact model performance. Careful measurement is crucial.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the appropriate regression model depends on the complexity of the robotic arm's kinematics.  Simple models like linear regression might suffice for a simple arm, while more complex models might be needed for more articulated arms.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforces practical application of machine learning algorithms:** This project provides hands-on experience in using regression models for real-world problem solving.
- **Develops understanding of robotic arm calibration:**  The project enhances understanding of the fundamental concepts behind robotic arm control and calibration techniques.
