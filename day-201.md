# Mini-Game AI Agent with Self-Play Learning

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a miniature game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, utilizing self-play reinforcement learning. The agent will learn optimal strategies through repeated self-play, demonstrating a basic implementation of a powerful AI technique.  The focus will be on a functional prototype demonstrating the learning process, not on achieving superhuman performance.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game visualization, optional)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- Reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3, a lightweight option might be preferable for a short timeframe)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Game Engine:  Implementation of the chosen game's rules and logic.
    - AI Agent:  A reinforcement learning agent capable of playing the game.
    - Self-Play Learning: The agent plays against itself, updating its strategy based on the outcomes.
    - Simple Win/Loss Tracking: Basic metrics to track the agent's progress.
    - Basic Visualization:  Optional:  Visual representation of the game state (using Pygame).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different learning parameters to improve performance.
    - More sophisticated reward function: Going beyond simple win/loss to incorporate metrics like efficiency of moves.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Engine Implementation:** Create a class representing the game board and its rules (e.g., checking for wins, valid moves).
2. **Agent Implementation:** Define the AI agent using a chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler method).  Focus on a minimal viable implementation.
3. **Self-Play Loop:** Implement a loop where the agent plays against itself many times, updating its strategy based on the outcomes of each game.
4. **Visualization (Optional):** Integrate Pygame to visualize the game and the agent's learning process.
5. **Evaluation:** After a sufficient number of self-play iterations, test the agent's performance against a simple rule-based opponent or a human.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm that balances complexity and feasibility for a short development time is crucial. A simpler algorithm like Q-learning might be more suitable.
- **Computational Cost:** Self-play can be computationally expensive, especially for more complex games.  Limiting the number of iterations or using efficient data structures might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:  Practical experience in implementing a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Agent-based Programming:  Developing and testing an autonomous agent that learns through experience.
