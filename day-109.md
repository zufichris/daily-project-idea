# AI-Powered Image Captioning for Robotic Object Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simple AI system that generates descriptive captions for images captured by a simulated robot arm or a webcam. The goal is to enhance a robot's object recognition capabilities by providing contextual descriptions beyond simple object identification. This allows for more nuanced interaction with the environment.  A successful prototype will demonstrate the integration of image processing, machine learning, and text generation for robotic applications.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (image processing), TensorFlow/PyTorch (machine learning), Transformers (text generation)
* **Pre-trained Models:** A pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) and a pre-trained captioning model (e.g., from the Hugging Face model hub)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition:** Capture images from a webcam or a simulated robot arm's camera.
- **Object Detection:** Identify and locate objects within the captured image using a pre-trained object detection model.
- **Caption Generation:** Generate a descriptive caption for the detected objects using a pre-trained captioning model.
- **Output Display:** Display the image with bounding boxes around detected objects and the generated caption overlaid.
- **Data Logging (optional):** Log image data, detection results, and generated captions for later analysis.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Spatial relationships between objects in the caption (e.g., "A red ball is on top of a blue box").
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Real-time captioning with a low latency.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries and download pre-trained models.  Set up image acquisition from webcam or simulated robot arm.
2. **Object Detection:** Integrate the object detection model to process images and identify objects with bounding boxes.
3. **Caption Generation:**  Use the captioning model to generate captions based on the detected objects and their coordinates.
4. **Output Integration:** Combine the image, bounding boxes, and generated caption for display.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various images and refine the parameters for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate pre-trained models that balance accuracy and inference speed is crucial.  Overly complex models may be too slow for real-time processing.
- **Contextual Understanding:**  Achieving accurate and descriptive captions that capture the spatial relationships and context of objects might require further model fine-tuning or a more sophisticated approach.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of image processing pipelines:** Combining object detection and caption generation into a unified system.
- **Gain experience integrating pre-trained AI models:** Learn how to effectively leverage pre-trained models for a specific robotic application.
