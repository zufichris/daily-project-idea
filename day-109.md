# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple system for calibrating the end-effector position of a robotic arm using a computer vision approach.  The goal is to accurately determine the arm's position in 3D space without relying on its internal encoders, which might be inaccurate or unavailable. This is crucial for tasks requiring precise positioning, such as pick-and-place operations. A simplified prototype using a simulated robotic arm can be easily built and tested within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- A robotic arm simulator (e.g., PyBullet, V-REP)  *OR* a physical robotic arm with appropriate drivers.
- A simple color marker (e.g., a red ball) for vision tracking.

## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Calibration:**  Calibrate the camera intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) using a standard chessboard calibration pattern.
- **Marker Detection:** Detect the position of the color marker (red ball) in the camera image using OpenCV's color filtering and blob detection functions.
- **3D Position Estimation:** Estimate the 3D position of the marker in the camera coordinate system using perspective projection and camera calibration parameters.
- **Inverse Kinematics (Optional):** If a physical or simulated robotic arm is available, use inverse kinematics to calculate the joint angles needed to move the arm's end-effector to a target position.
- **Error Calculation and Visualization:**  Compare the estimated 3D position with the known (simulated or measured) position of the end-effector and calculate the error. Visualize this error in a clear manner.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the virtual or physical camera using OpenCV's `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function with a chessboard pattern.
2. **Marker Detection and 3D Position Estimation:** Implement color filtering and blob detection to find the marker in the camera image. Use the camera's intrinsic parameters and marker's pixel coordinates to compute its 3D position.
3. **Robotic Arm Control (Optional):** If using a simulated or physical robotic arm, implement inverse kinematics to calculate and send the required joint angles to move the end-effector to the estimated 3D position of the marker.
4. **Error Calculation:** Compare the estimated position with the ground truth position (either from simulation or through direct measurement). Calculate the error in terms of Euclidean distance.
5. **Visualization:** Display the camera image, the detected marker, the estimated 3D position, and the error metric.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of 3D Position Estimation:** The accuracy depends heavily on camera calibration, lighting conditions, and the quality of marker detection. Robust methods for marker tracking and outlier rejection are crucial.
- **Inverse Kinematics (Optional):** Solving inverse kinematics can be computationally expensive and might require iterative algorithms.  Consider using pre-existing libraries or simplified models if available.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques, specifically camera calibration, object detection, and 3D position estimation from 2D images.
- Gain practical experience integrating computer vision with robotics, understanding the challenges of sensor-based control and calibration procedures.
