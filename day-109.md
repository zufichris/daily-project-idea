# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning).  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts, not creating a polished game. The game will be a simplified version of a classic game, like Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Snake.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Pygame (for game development)
- NumPy (for numerical computation)
- A suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable 2D game with a simple visual interface.
    - An AI opponent using Q-learning to make decisions.
    - A basic reward system for the AI (e.g., +1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for a draw).
    - Ability to display the AI's Q-values (optional visual representation).
    - Ability to save and load the trained AI model.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for the AI.
    -  A simple GUI to adjust learning parameters (learning rate, discount factor).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Design and implement the basic game logic and visual representation using Pygame.  Focus on a minimal, functional game.
2. **Q-learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm.  Define the state space, action space, and reward function for the game.
3. **AI Training:** Train the AI by letting it play against itself many times. Save the trained Q-table.
4. **Human vs. AI:** Implement functionality to allow a human player to play against the trained AI.
5. **(Optional) GUI Enhancements:**  Add a basic GUI for parameter adjustment if time permits.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **State Space Representation:**  Efficiently representing the game state to avoid a prohibitively large Q-table.  Consider state aggregation or feature engineering.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding appropriate values for the learning rate and discount factor may require some experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with implementing Q-learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm.
-  Gain familiarity with using Pygame for rapid game development.
-  Improved understanding of state space representation and reward function design in RL.
