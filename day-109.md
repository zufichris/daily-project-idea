# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the core principles of RL, rather than building a highly sophisticated agent. The chosen game will be easily definable and computationally inexpensive, allowing for significant progress within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- A suitable game environment (e.g., a simple custom environment or a readily available library like Gym's simple environments)

## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Game Environment:** Create a minimalistic game (e.g., a grid-based navigation game with a goal state and obstacles).
- **Agent Implementation:** Develop a Q-learning agent that learns through trial and error to reach the goal.
- **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that allows the agent to interact with the environment, receive rewards, and update its Q-values.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Track the agent's progress (e.g., steps to reach the goal) over training iterations.
- **Visualization (Optional):** Display the game environment and the agent's actions during training or testing.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Game Environment:**  Design a simple game environment (e.g., a 5x5 grid) with clear rules, reward structure (e.g., +1 for reaching the goal, -0.1 for each step), and start/goal states.
2. **Implement the Q-learning Agent:** Create the core Q-learning algorithm using a chosen deep learning framework. Initialize the Q-table or neural network.
3. **Train the Agent:**  Run the training loop, letting the agent interact with the environment and update its Q-values.  Monitor its performance.
4. **Evaluate the Agent:** Test the trained agent's performance by running multiple episodes and averaging its score.
5. **Optional Visualization:** Add visualization to see the agent's path and learning progress.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal learning rate, discount factor, and exploration/exploitation parameters may require experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and iterate.
- **Environment Complexity:** Balancing the simplicity of the environment with the challenge of the learning task is crucial.  A too-simple environment might lead to trivial solutions.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning principles (e.g., Q-learning).
- Experience in designing and implementing a simple game environment.
- Understanding of hyperparameter tuning in the context of RL.
