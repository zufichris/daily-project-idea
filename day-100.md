# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures to trigger pre-defined actions, demonstrating a hands-free and intuitive interaction method. This is significant as it explores a more natural and accessible form of human-computer interaction for smart home environments.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (pose estimation), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for model optimization and deployment)
- **Tools:**  Webcam, Jupyter Notebook or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), potentially a Raspberry Pi for deployment (optional).


## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., hand wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for volume increase, thumbs down for volume decrease).
- **Action Triggering:**  Execute predefined actions based on recognized gestures (e.g., controlling smart lights, adjusting volume on a connected speaker).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **User Calibration (Optional):** Allow for calibration to adjust gesture recognition thresholds based on individual hand size and movement styles.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle situations where gestures are not clearly recognized.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Capture a dataset of the chosen micro-gestures using the webcam.  Preprocess the images (resizing, noise reduction).
2. **Feature Extraction:** Utilize MediaPipe to extract key points from hand poses in each frame.  These points will be the features for gesture classification.
3. **Model Training (Optional):** If time allows, train a simple machine learning model (e.g., a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier or a small neural network) to classify gestures based on extracted features.  Otherwise, use a rule-based approach based on relative positions of keypoints.
4. **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** Integrate the trained model (or rule-based system) into a real-time loop that processes the webcam feed and triggers actions.
5. **Action Execution:**  Implement the action triggering mechanism (e.g., using existing smart home APIs or simulating actions).


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Changes in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Consider using techniques for robust lighting compensation.
- **Background Noise:**  Clutter or movement in the background can interfere with accurate hand detection.  Explore background subtraction techniques.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience in image processing, feature extraction, and gesture recognition techniques.
- **Real-time System Development:**  Develop a system that processes data in real-time, understanding the trade-offs between accuracy and speed.
