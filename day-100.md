# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using a combination of voice commands and hand gestures.  This combines two popular interaction modalities to provide a more intuitive and flexible control mechanism.  The focus will be on a functional prototype rather than a polished user interface.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  PyAudio (for audio input), OpenCV (for computer vision/gesture recognition), a suitable library for your chosen smart appliance API (e.g.,  Home Assistant API, Philips Hue API).
* **Hardware:** A microphone, a webcam (or similar computer vision device),  and the target smart appliance.
* **Optional:**  A Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer for a more portable solution.


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Set lamp to 50% brightness."
- **Gesture Control:**  Simple gestures like a hand wave for on/off, and a hand raise for brightness increase/decrease.
- **Appliance Integration:**  Seamless integration with a chosen smart appliance's API.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle invalid voice commands or unrecognized gestures.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  Provide visual or auditory feedback on the system's actions.

- **Advanced Features:**  Gesture-based control of multiple appliances, voice command queuing.
- **Optional Feature:**  Speech-to-text engine selection (e.g., Google Speech Recognition vs. other options) for comparison.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the chosen smart appliance API.
2. **Voice command processing:** Implement voice recognition using PyAudio and a suitable speech-to-text engine.  Map voice commands to appliance control actions.
3. **Gesture recognition:** Implement basic gesture recognition using OpenCV.  Train a simple model to recognize pre-defined gestures.
4. **Integration:** Connect voice and gesture recognition modules to control the smart appliance via its API.
5. **Testing and refinement:** Test the system with various voice commands and gestures, and refine the recognition algorithms as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Ensuring robust gesture recognition in varying lighting conditions and hand positions will be challenging.  Consider using a simpler gesture set initially.
- **API Limitations:**  The chosen smart appliance API might have limitations on the types of control commands supported.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce skills in integrating multiple libraries:** This project requires integrating audio processing, computer vision, and API interaction libraries.
- **Practical experience with real-time system development:** Building a system that responds to live inputs (voice and gestures) provides valuable experience in real-time programming.
