# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, playable game (e.g., a simplified version of Pong or Snake) and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn optimal strategies within a day or two. This showcases RL principles in a tangible application.  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrable learning within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame (game development), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (RL framework), NumPy (numerical computation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A functional, playable 2D game with simple rules and intuitive controls (human player input).
    - An RL agent that interacts with the game environment.
    -  Basic reward system to guide the agent's learning (e.g., points for winning, penalties for losing).
    - Training loop for the RL agent to learn optimal actions through trial and error.
    - Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting rewards over time).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Saving and loading of trained agent models.
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., DQN instead of a simple Q-learning).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Development:** Create a minimal playable game using Pygame. Focus on core mechanics and a simple visual representation.
2. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the RL agent.  This includes defining states, actions, rewards, and transitions.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) and implement it using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
4. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop to run the agent in the environment, updating its policy based on received rewards.
5. **Visualization and Evaluation:** Plot the agentâ€™s reward over time to monitor learning progress and observe its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) for the RL algorithm may require experimentation within the limited timeframe.  Starting with default values and iteratively adjusting is recommended.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A well-designed reward function is crucial for effective learning.  A poorly designed reward function can lead to unexpected or suboptimal agent behavior.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning principles.
- Experience with RL frameworks (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
-  Improved understanding of MDPs and their role in RL.
