# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with Webcam

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed.  The system will detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and classify it. This provides a practical demonstration of computer vision techniques within a constrained timeframe.  The significance lies in the application of fundamental CV concepts and their rapid prototyping.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (for optional classification), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:**  Identify and locate a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in the webcam feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Continuously track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Display a bounding box around the tracked object on the video feed.
- **Coordinate Logging:** Log the object's (x, y) coordinates in real-time (optional: to a file).
- **Object Classification (Advanced):** Classify the tracked object using a pre-trained model (optional).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras if needed). Set up the webcam feed using OpenCV.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement color filtering or a simpler object detection algorithm (e.g., using HSV color spaces) to identify the target object.
3. **Object Tracking:** Utilize OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`, `cv2.TrackerKCF`) to maintain continuous tracking of the detected object.
4. **Bounding Box & Logging:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object and log its coordinates.
5. **Classification (Optional):** Integrate a pre-trained model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub) to classify the tracked object if time allows.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing might be challenging with complex algorithms or low-powered hardware.  Consider using optimized algorithms and potentially reducing image resolution.
- **Object Occlusion:** The tracker might lose the object if it becomes fully or partially occluded. Implementing robust tracking techniques to handle occlusions would be an improvement (beyond the scope of a single day's work).

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of:** OpenCV's functionalities for image processing, object detection, and video analysis.
- **Gain practical experience with:** real-time computer vision applications, including tracking algorithms and potentially object classification using pre-trained models.
