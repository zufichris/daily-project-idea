# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using Reinforcement Learning (RL).  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating the core principles of RL within a constrained timeframe.  The significance lies in understanding how RL algorithms can learn optimal strategies in a deterministic environment.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, if not using a pre-built one), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for RL model), NumPy (for numerical computation).


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  A basic Q-learning or SARSA agent to learn optimal game strategies.
- **Training Loop:**  A process to train the agent against a random opponent or itself.
- **Evaluation:**  A function to evaluate the agent's performance against a random opponent or a pre-programmed strategy.
- **Visualization (Optional):** Display the game state and agent's actions during training and evaluation.


- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more sophisticated RL algorithm like Deep Q-Network (DQN) if time permits.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better interaction.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Choose a game (Tic-Tac-Toe is simpler) and create the game environment.  This can be as simple as a class with functions for making moves, checking for wins, and determining game states.  If using OpenAI Gym, leverage pre-built environments.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent. Define the state space, action space, and reward function. This will involve updating Q-values based on observed rewards and transitions.
3. **Training:**  Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, allowing the agent to learn through interactions.  Track the agent's performance over time.
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the trained agent's performance by playing against a random opponent or a deterministic strategy (e.g., always choosing the center square in Tic-Tac-Toe).
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If time allows, create a simple visualization to display the game's progression and the agent's learning process.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Time Constraints:**  The biggest challenge will be managing the time effectively. Prioritize core features and avoid getting bogged down in advanced features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, exploration rate, etc.) for the RL algorithm might require experimentation. Start with reasonable default values and iterate based on initial results.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Practical application of fundamental RL concepts (e.g., Q-learning, state-action space, reward function).
- **Python Programming:**  Strengthening Python skills for data manipulation, algorithm implementation, and library usage.
