# Minimalist Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Overview

This project focuses on building a minimalist inverse kinematics (IK) solver for a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).  The solver will take a target (x, y, z) coordinate as input and output the corresponding joint angles required to reach that point. This is a foundational problem in robotics, and a simplified version can be prototyped and tested within a day or two.  The significance lies in understanding and implementing core robotic manipulation concepts efficiently.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy (for numerical computation), SciPy (for optimization if needed), Matplotlib (for visualization â€“ optional)


## Features & Requirements

- **Forward Kinematics Calculation:**  Implement forward kinematics to calculate the end-effector position given joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics Solver (Iterative Approach):**  Develop a numerical iterative solver (e.g., using gradient descent or Newton-Raphson) to find joint angles corresponding to a given target position.
- **Input Handling:**  Create a simple interface (command line or basic GUI) to accept target (x, y, z) coordinates as input.
- **Output Presentation:** Display the calculated joint angles.
- **Visualization (Optional):**  Visualize the robotic arm and its movement using Matplotlib.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a closed-form solution for inverse kinematics if the arm's geometry allows it (e.g., a specific configuration like a planar 3-DOF arm).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Add obstacle avoidance functionality (simplified approach, e.g., checking for collision with a simple bounding box).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Robot Kinematics:** Define the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters or a similar representation for the 3-DOF robotic arm.  Choose a simple arm geometry to simplify calculations.
2. **Implement Forward Kinematics:** Write a function to calculate the end-effector position based on the DH parameters and joint angles.  Thoroughly test this function.
3. **Implement Inverse Kinematics Solver:** Implement an iterative method (e.g., gradient descent) to find the joint angles that minimize the distance between the calculated end-effector position and the target position.
4. **Create Input/Output Interface:** Build a simple interface (command line or basic GUI) to get target coordinates and display the calculated joint angles.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the solver with various target positions and refine the parameters (e.g., step size, tolerance) of the iterative solver for optimal performance.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Convergence Issues:** The iterative IK solver might not converge for all target positions, especially if the target is unreachable due to joint limits or arm geometry.  Strategies like adjusting the step size or using a different optimization algorithm might be needed.
- **Singularity Handling:**  Certain arm configurations might lead to singularities (where the Jacobian matrix becomes singular), causing numerical instability.  Handling these situations might require advanced techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of robotic kinematics:** This project strengthens the understanding of forward and inverse kinematics, key concepts in robotics.
- **Practical experience with numerical optimization:** Implementing and tuning an iterative solver provides practical experience with numerical optimization techniques.
