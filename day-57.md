# Automated Code Style Enforcement Bot

## Overview

This project involves building a simple bot that automatically enforces code style guidelines within a specified Git repository. The bot will analyze newly pushed commits, identify style violations using a pre-configured linter, and leave comments directly on the pull request detailing the issues.  This automates a crucial part of the code review process, improving code quality and consistency.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework/Library:**  `GitHub API v3`, `pylint` (or similar linter like `flake8`), `requests`
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub account (or similar Git platform)

## Features & Requirements

- **Commit Analysis:** The bot analyzes each new commit pushed to a specified branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
- **Style Violation Detection:** It uses `pylint` (or chosen linter) to identify style violations in the changed code.
- **Pull Request Commenting:** It posts comments on the associated pull request highlighting the line numbers and descriptions of the identified violations.
- **Configuration:** The bot should be configurable via a simple configuration file to specify the repository, target branch, and linter settings.
- **Threshold Control:** The bot can be configured to ignore a certain number of minor violations.

- **Advanced Feature:**  Integration with a CI/CD pipeline for automated style checking before merging.
- **Optional Feature:**  Generating a summary report of code style violations across the repository.


## Implementation Steps

1. **GitHub API Authentication:**  Set up authentication with the GitHub API using a personal access token.
2. **Commit Hook Setup (optional but recommended):** Configure a GitHub Actions workflow or a local Git hook to trigger the bot on every push to the specified branch.
3. **Code Analysis and Violation Detection:** Implement the core logic using `pylint` to parse the changed code within a commit and identify violations.
4. **Pull Request Commenting:** Utilize the GitHub API to post comments on the pull request, referencing the specific lines containing style violations.
5. **Configuration and Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and create a configuration file for customizable parameters.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Rate Limiting:** The GitHub API has rate limits.  Efficiently managing requests and handling potential rate limit exceeding errors is crucial.
- **False Positives:** Linters can sometimes flag legitimate code as violations.  Fine-tuning the linter configuration might be necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **API Interaction:**  Experience with interacting with a RESTful API (GitHub API).
- **Automated Testing:** Understanding and potentially implementing simple testing for parts of the bot's functionality.
