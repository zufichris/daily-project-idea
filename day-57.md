# Self-Balancing Robot Arm Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple self-balancing robotic arm controlled using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.  The goal is to create a system where a small robotic arm, potentially simulated initially, maintains a stable upright position despite disturbances. This project showcases the application of PID control, a fundamental concept in robotics and control systems, in a tangible way.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for simulation/visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation)
- **Optional:**  A microcontroller (Arduino or similar) and servo motors for physical implementation.


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position despite simulated or real-world disturbances (e.g., simulated wind gusts, physical pushes).
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to adjust the arm's position based on error feedback.
- **Real-time Feedback:**  The system should provide real-time visual feedback of the arm's position and control signals (in simulation or via connected hardware).
- **Tuning Interface:**  A simple interface (command line or GUI) to adjust PID gains (P, I, D) for optimal performance.
- **Basic Disturbance Simulation:**  Simulation of small, random disturbances to test the robustness of the controller (if not using physical hardware).

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementation with physical hardware and sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope).
- **Advanced Features:**  Adding a trajectory following component, allowing the user to specify target angles for the arm.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Simulation Setup (or Hardware Connection):** If using simulation, set up a basic Pygame window to visualize the robotic arm. If using hardware, connect the microcontroller and servo motors, ensuring correct wiring and library installation.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Develop the core PID controller algorithm in Python.  Start with basic proportional control, then add integral and derivative terms iteratively.
3. **Feedback Loop Integration:** Integrate the PID controller with the simulation/hardware. The controller should receive feedback (angle/position) and calculate appropriate control signals to adjust the arm's position.
4. **Tuning and Testing:** Experiment with different PID gains to find optimal settings for stable self-balancing. Test the system's response to simulated or real-world disturbances.
5. **Visualization/Data Logging (Optional):**  Log control signals and arm position over time for analysis and visualization.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and often requires iterative adjustments.  Consider starting with simple proportional control and gradually adding integral and derivative terms.
- **Hardware Synchronization (if using physical hardware):**  Ensure proper timing and synchronization between the microcontroller and the computer's control loop.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Controller Design and Implementation:**  Gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller.
- **Real-time Control Systems:**  Understand the fundamental principles of real-time feedback control and its application in robotics.
