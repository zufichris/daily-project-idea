# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, yet engaging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to create a functional AI opponent that can learn and improve its strategy within a short timeframe. This project demonstrates a practical application of reinforcement learning in a constrained environment.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3
- Libraries:  Gym (for environment creation, optional), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for reinforcement learning model), NumPy
- IDE:  VS Code, PyCharm, or similar.


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - A reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning or a simpler algorithm.
    - Training functionality allowing the AI to play against itself to learn optimal strategies.
    - A user interface (CLI is sufficient for this scope) to interact with the game and AI.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    - Visualization of the Q-table or policy during training.
    - Implementing a different reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., SARSA).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment:**  Define the game rules and create a function to represent the game board and game logic (checking for wins, draws, etc.). For simplicity, utilize existing libraries like Gym if time permits, otherwise create a custom implementation.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent. This involves initializing the Q-table, defining the reward function, and implementing the Q-learning update rule.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop where the agent plays many games against itself, updating its Q-table after each game.  Use a suitable number of training iterations based on available time.
4. **User Interface:** Build a basic command-line interface to allow a human player to play against the trained AI agent.
5. **Testing and Evaluation:** Play several games against the AI to assess its performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Convergence Time:** Q-learning's convergence speed depends on hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate). Experimentation and adjustment might be necessary to achieve reasonable performance within the timeframe.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:**  Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using the best known actions) is crucial for effective learning. Finding a good balance might require experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts.
- Understanding of Q-learning algorithm and its implementation.
- Experience in designing and implementing simple AI agents.
