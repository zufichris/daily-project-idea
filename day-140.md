#  Miniature Robot Obstacle Avoidance with Real-time Feedback

## Overview

This project aims to build a simplified obstacle avoidance system for a miniature robot (e.g., a small wheeled robot with an onboard microcontroller) using ultrasonic sensors and real-time feedback displayed on a connected computer. The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental robotics concept within a limited timeframe, focusing on efficient sensor integration and data visualization.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:**  A miniature wheeled robot (e.g., Arduino-based), ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and a computer with a serial port (USB).
* **Software:** Arduino IDE (C++), Processing (Java) or a similar visualization library (e.g., Python with matplotlib or Pygame).

## Features & Requirements

- **Ultrasonic Sensing:** The robot should accurately measure distances to obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implement basic obstacle avoidance logic: stop when an obstacle is detected within a defined threshold.
- **Motor Control:** Control the robot's motors to move forward and turn based on sensor readings.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display the sensor readings and robot's state (e.g., moving forward, turning) on a computer screen in real-time.
- **Distance Threshold Setting:** Allow user adjustment of the obstacle detection distance through a simple interface.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a more sophisticated avoidance algorithm (e.g., wall-following).
- **Optional Feature:**  Add visual feedback on the robot itself (e.g., using LEDs).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the robot's microcontroller (Arduino) and ensure motors are correctly wired.
2. **Sensor Reading & Data Processing:** Write an Arduino program to read sensor data, perform distance calculations, and trigger motor control based on pre-defined thresholds.
3. **Serial Communication:** Configure serial communication between the Arduino and the computer to transmit sensor data.
4. **Data Visualization:** Create a Processing or Python script to receive serial data, and visualize it as a graph of distance over time and display robot's status.
5. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the Arduino and visualization program, test the obstacle avoidance functionality, and refine thresholds as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:** Ultrasonic sensors can be susceptible to noise, requiring filtering or averaging techniques for reliable data.
- **Motor Control Precision:** Precise motor control might require calibration or fine-tuning depending on the robotâ€™s motor drivers.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Embedded Systems Programming:** Reinforces practical skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and motor control.
- **Real-time Data Processing & Visualization:** Develops expertise in handling real-time data streams and creating informative visualizations.
