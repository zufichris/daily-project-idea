# Automated Code Style Checker with Customizable Rules

## Overview

This project aims to create a command-line tool that automatically checks code style against a user-defined set of rules.  The tool will focus on speed and customizability, allowing rapid prototyping and iteration of style guidelines. This is significant because it allows for consistent code quality across projects and teams without requiring extensive manual review.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python (for its rapid prototyping capabilities and extensive libraries)
- **Libraries:** `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Tree parsing), `argparse` (for command-line argument parsing), `yaml` (for configuration file handling).
- **Tools:** A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) and a terminal.

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:** Allow users to define custom style rules via a YAML configuration file (e.g., maximum line length, indentation style, naming conventions).
- **Code Parsing:** Parse the source code (Python, initially) using the `ast` module to analyze its structure.
- **Rule Enforcement:** Check the parsed code against the defined rules and report violations.
- **Output Formatting:** Provide clear and concise output indicating the type, location, and description of each style violation.
- **Configurable Severity:** Allow users to define severity levels for each rule (warning, error).


- **Advanced Feature:** Support for multiple programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, C++).
- **Optional Feature:**  Integration with a code formatter to automatically correct style violations.


## Implementation Steps

1. **YAML Configuration:**  Design the structure of the YAML configuration file and implement the parsing logic using the `yaml` library.  Create a sample configuration file.
2. **AST Parsing:** Implement code parsing using the `ast` module. Focus on extracting relevant information (line numbers, variable names, function definitions) required for rule checking.
3. **Rule Enforcement:**  Implement functions to check code against the rules defined in the YAML configuration. This will involve traversing the AST and comparing it to the rule criteria.
4. **Output Generation:** Design the output format (e.g., JSON, plain text) and implement the logic to generate the reports.
5. **Command-Line Interface:** Use `argparse` to create a user-friendly command-line interface for specifying the code file and the configuration file.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling complex AST structures:** Parsing complex code constructs can be challenging and may require more sophisticated AST traversal techniques.  Start with simple rules and gradually increase complexity.
- **Error handling:**  Robust error handling is crucial to manage situations where the input code is invalid or the configuration file is improperly formatted. Implement comprehensive try-except blocks.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of ASTs:**  This project strengthens understanding of Abstract Syntax Trees and how they can be used for code analysis.
- **Improve skills in configuration file management and command-line tool development:** This provides practical experience in designing and implementing configurable tools.
