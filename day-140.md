# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet engaging, 2D game and implement a basic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play it. The game will be designed to be easily implemented and allow for rapid experimentation with different RL algorithms. This provides a practical demonstration of RL concepts within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Game Development Library: Pygame
- Reinforcement Learning Library: Stable Baselines3 or a similar library

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a maze navigation or simple platformer).
    - An RL agent that learns to play the game through trial and error.
    - Basic reward system (e.g., reward for reaching a goal, penalty for collisions).
    - Visualization of the game and agent's actions.
    - Data logging to track agent's performance.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Different RL algorithms (e.g., DQN, PPO).
    - Hyperparameter tuning.
    - A simple graphical user interface for controlling game parameters.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Design & Implementation:** Create a basic 2D game using Pygame.  Focus on simplicity â€“ a small maze or a simple platform with a few obstacles is sufficient.
2. **Environment Wrapper:** Create a wrapper around the Pygame game to integrate it with the chosen RL library. This wrapper should handle actions, observations, and rewards.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Choose a simple RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from Stable Baselines3) and implement it to control the game agent.
4. **Training & Evaluation:** Train the agent using the defined reward system. Monitor performance by logging relevant metrics.
5. **Visualization & Analysis:** Visualize the agent's learning process and analyze the logged data.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Crafting an effective reward function that encourages optimal behavior is crucial.  Poorly designed rewards may lead to suboptimal or unexpected agent behavior. Iterative refinement might be necessary.
- **Computational Resources:** Training RL agents can be computationally intensive. Simpler game environments and RL algorithms are crucial for staying within the time constraints.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms.
- Experience with game development using Pygame and integrating it with an RL library.
- Understanding of the challenges involved in designing effective reward functions for RL agents.
