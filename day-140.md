# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple computer vision system to calibrate the end-effector position of a robotic arm.  Accurate calibration is crucial for precise robotic manipulation, and this project will demonstrate a practical approach using readily available tools. The goal is to develop a system that can automatically adjust the robotic arm's internal position model based on visual feedback, correcting for any positional errors. This is a simplified version focusing on a single point calibration.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), NumPy (for numerical computation), a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, specific manufacturer's SDK).
- **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple, low-cost one will suffice), a camera (webcam or similar), a calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard).


## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera to obtain intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients).
- **Target Detection:** Detect the calibration target in the camera image using OpenCV's feature detection functionalities.
- **Position Estimation:** Estimate the 3D position of the calibration target in the camera coordinate system using known target dimensions and camera parameters.
- **Arm Position Correction:** Compare the estimated target position with the robotic arm's reported position and calculate the necessary correction.
- **Feedback Loop (Optional):** Implement a simple feedback loop to iteratively refine the arm's position until it matches the estimated target position.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function to calibrate the camera using images of the calibration target from different viewpoints.
2. **Target Detection & Pose Estimation:** Detect the calibration target in a new image using `findChessboardCorners` and then use `solvePnP` to estimate its pose (position and orientation).
3. **Robotic Arm Control:**  Use the robotic arm's control interface to move the end-effector to a known initial position.  Obtain the arm's reported position.
4. **Position Comparison & Correction:** Compare the estimated target position (from step 2) with the reported arm position. Calculate the difference and adjust the arm's position accordingly. This step may require a transformation between the camera coordinate system and the robot's coordinate system.
5. **(Optional) Iteration & Refinement:** Repeat steps 2-4 several times to iteratively refine the arm's position until it converges to the desired accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Coordinate System Transformations:** Accurately transforming coordinates between the camera and robot coordinate systems can be challenging and requires careful consideration of rotations and translations.
- **Noise and Uncertainty:**  Camera calibration and pose estimation are prone to noise and uncertainties. Robust error handling and filtering techniques are necessary.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Hands-on experience with camera calibration, feature detection, and pose estimation using OpenCV.
- **Robotics Control Integration:** Practical experience in integrating computer vision with robotic arm control, bridging the gap between perception and action.
