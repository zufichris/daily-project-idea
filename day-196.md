# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of pre-defined micro-gestures, offering a hands-free and intuitive interaction method compared to voice commands or touch interfaces. This is particularly useful in situations where voice commands are inappropriate or hands are occupied.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), a suitable Machine Learning library (Scikit-learn or TensorFlow Lite for simpler models).
* **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with sufficient processing power.  A pre-existing smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API) could be integrated for advanced features (optional).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurately track hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, a specific hand wave) for controlling different smart home appliances.
- **Device Control:**  Trigger predefined actions (e.g., turn on/off lights, adjust volume) based on recognized gestures.
- **User Interface:**  A simple visual representation of the recognized gestures and the corresponding smart home commands.
- **Calibration:**  A short calibration routine to account for individual hand sizes and lighting conditions.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Integration with a smart home API to control actual devices.
- A more robust gesture recognition model using a larger training dataset.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Hand Tracking:** Install necessary libraries and set up the webcam feed using OpenCV. Integrate MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to obtain hand landmark coordinates.
2. **Gesture Definition and Feature Extraction:** Define three to five distinct micro-gestures.  Extract relevant features from the hand landmark data (e.g., distances between landmarks, angles of joints).
3. **Model Training (Simple):** Use a simple machine learning algorithm (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine) to train a model that maps feature vectors to gestures.  A small dataset of gesture examples can be collected manually for training.
4. **Real-time Gesture Recognition and Control:**  Integrate the trained model into the real-time processing pipeline. When a gesture is recognized, trigger the corresponding action (initially simulated, then via API if integrated).
5. **UI Development:** Create a basic interface using a library like Tkinter or PyQt to visualize the hand tracking, recognized gestures, and control outputs.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with minimal training data might be challenging.  Careful feature selection and model choice are crucial.
- **Robustness to variations in lighting and hand positioning:** The system's performance might be affected by changes in lighting or inconsistent hand positioning. Techniques like image preprocessing (e.g., noise reduction, contrast enhancement) can help mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical skills in computer vision:**  Gain hands-on experience with libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time video processing and hand tracking.
- **Develop skills in basic machine learning for classification tasks:**  Understand the process of feature extraction, model selection, training, and evaluation in a practical context.
