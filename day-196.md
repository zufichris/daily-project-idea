# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple, yet challenging, AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL).  The goal is to implement a basic RL algorithm and observe its learning progress within a short timeframe. This project emphasizes a practical application of RL principles, demonstrating its power in creating intelligent agents for simple games.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenAI Gym (or a custom environment), TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -   Implementation of a chosen game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -   Training of a RL agent using Q-learning or SARSA.
    -   Agent plays against itself to learn optimal strategies.
    -   Visualization of the agent's learning curve (e.g., win rate over time).
    -   Agent plays against a human opponent.
- **Advanced Features:**
    -   Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm like Deep Q-Network (DQN).
    -   Incorporating an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment using OpenAI Gym or a custom Python class.  Define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:**  Implement the chosen RL algorithm (Q-learning, SARSA, or DQN). Define the Q-table (for simpler algorithms) or neural network (for DQN).
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop where the agent plays against itself numerous times, updating its Q-values or network weights based on the rewards received.
4. **Evaluation:**  After training, evaluate the agent's performance against a human opponent or a pre-defined optimal strategy.
5. **Visualization:** Plot the learning curve (e.g., win rate, average reward) to showcase the agent's learning progress.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for the agent to learn effectively.  A poorly designed reward function may lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Computational Cost:**  Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can be computationally expensive.  For a daily challenge, focusing on simpler algorithms like Q-learning might be more practical.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Concepts:** This project reinforces understanding of fundamental RL concepts such as Q-learning, SARSA, exploration-exploitation trade-off, and reward functions.
- **Python Programming & Libraries:**  The project provides practical experience using Python and libraries like OpenAI Gym and TensorFlow/Keras for RL implementation.
