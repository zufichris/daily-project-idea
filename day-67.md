# Intelligent Traffic Light Simulator

## Overview

This project aims to create a simplified simulation of a traffic intersection controlled by an intelligent traffic light system. The simulation will prioritize minimizing wait times and optimizing traffic flow based on real-time vehicle detection (simulated). This project is significant as it allows for rapid prototyping and testing of different traffic control algorithms without the need for real-world infrastructure.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for numerical computation), random (for simulating vehicle arrival)
* **Tools:**  A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Vehicle Generation:**  The simulator should randomly generate vehicles at specified entry points with varying speeds.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Implement a simple traffic light system with configurable cycle times.
- **Vehicle Detection:** Simulate vehicle detection using random number generation to represent sensor data.
- **Traffic Flow Optimization (Basic):** Implement a basic algorithm (e.g., fixed-time control) to manage traffic light cycles.
- **Visualization:** Display the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light status graphically using Pygame.

- **Advanced Features:** Adaptive traffic light control (adjusting cycle times based on vehicle density), multiple intersection simulation.
- **Optional Feature:**  Export simulation data (vehicle wait times, throughput) for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create the Pygame window and initialize necessary variables (vehicle speed, traffic light states, etc.).
2. **Vehicle Generation & Movement:** Implement vehicle generation at entry points and update their positions based on speed and direction.
3. **Traffic Light Control (Basic):**  Implement a simple timer-based traffic light switching mechanism.
4. **Vehicle Detection & Traffic Light Adjustment (Basic):** Implement simulated sensor data and adjust traffic light timing based on the detected vehicle numbers (very basic algorithm initially).
5. **Visualization:** Render the intersection, vehicles, and traffic light status on the Pygame window.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Design:**  Designing an efficient and fair traffic light control algorithm that minimizes waiting time can be complex, especially within the limited time frame. Starting with a simple algorithm and gradually improving it is recommended.
- **Visualization Performance:**  Managing the visualization of many vehicles simultaneously might affect performance. Consider optimizing rendering techniques if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Algorithm Design and Implementation:** This project reinforces the skills needed to design, implement, and test algorithms, particularly within the context of real-time systems.
- **Simulation and Modeling:**  Building and running a simulation teaches practical skills in modeling real-world systems and testing various control strategies.
