# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview

This project focuses on building a real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV.  The goal is to develop a simple application that can identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball, a person) within a live video feed from a webcam. This project demonstrates core computer vision concepts within a manageable timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam or video file, a suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).  Optional:  TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for pre-trained object classification models.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:**  Acquire video frames from a webcam or video file.
- **Object Detection:** Identify a pre-defined object (e.g., by color) within each frame.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across consecutive frames using techniques like optical flow or simple bounding box tracking.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the video feed with a bounding box around the tracked object.
- **Performance Monitoring (Optional):** Measure the frames per second (FPS) to assess the system's efficiency.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a more robust object tracking algorithm (e.g., using a Kalman filter for smoother tracking).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integrate a pre-trained object classification model (e.g., YOLO, MobileNet) for object identification instead of color-based detection.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Video Capture:** Set up the OpenCV environment, initialize the webcam, and capture video frames.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a simple object detection algorithm based on color thresholding or other suitable method (depending on the chosen object).
3. **Object Tracking:**  Employ a tracking method (e.g., simple bounding box tracking) to follow the object's movement across frames.
4. **Visual Output:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object on each frame and display the resulting video.
5. **Performance Evaluation (Optional):** Calculate and display the FPS to assess the system's real-time performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Object Occlusion:** Handling situations where the object is temporarily hidden from view.  Solutions might involve using more sophisticated tracking algorithms or predicting the object's position.
- **Lighting Variations:**  Changes in lighting conditions can affect the accuracy of color-based object detection.  Consider using techniques to normalize or compensate for lighting changes.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of OpenCV:** This project provides hands-on experience with OpenCV functions for video processing, object detection, and visualization.
- **Practical application of computer vision concepts:**  The project demonstrates real-world applications of object tracking and detection, strengthening the understanding of these core computer vision techniques.
