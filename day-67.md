# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI Feedback

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype of a tool that automatically enforces coding style guidelines using a combination of static analysis and AI-powered feedback. The tool will analyze code, detect style violations, and provide intelligent suggestions for improvement, going beyond simple rule checks to offer context-aware recommendations.  This is significant because consistent code style improves readability, maintainability, and collaboration within development teams.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Static Analysis Tool:** Pylint (or similar for other languages)
* **AI/ML Library:**  Transformers (Hugging Face) or a smaller, task-specific model for style feedback
* **IDE Integration (Optional):**  VS Code extension API


## Features & Requirements

- **Static Analysis:**  Integrate Pylint to identify violations of PEP 8 (or equivalent style guides).
- **Violation Reporting:**  Generate a clear report listing all style violations with line numbers and descriptions.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Use a pre-trained model (or a fine-tuned one if time permits) to provide contextual suggestions for improvement beyond simple rule fixes.  For example, suggesting more descriptive variable names or restructuring code for better readability.
- **Severity Levels:** Categorize violations based on severity (warning, error, critical) to prioritize fixes.
- **Code Formatting (Optional):** Automatically format code to adhere to the chosen style guide (using tools like `black`).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (Python, Pylint, Transformers).
2. **Integrate Pylint:** Write a script to parse code and run Pylint, extracting violation details.
3. **AI Feedback Integration:** Integrate a pre-trained model (or create a small custom one using a smaller dataset if time permits) to process code snippets and provide intelligent suggestions.
4. **Report Generation:** Create a user-friendly report summarizing violations and AI-generated recommendations.
5. **(Optional) IDE Integration:** Begin building a basic VS Code extension to integrate the tool directly into the IDE.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **AI Model Selection:** Choosing the right pre-trained model or training a small effective model within the time constraint.  A smaller, focused model will be more practical for a 1-2 day project.
- **Handling Large Codebases:**  The performance of the static analysis and AI feedback might become slow with very large codebases.  Focus on a smaller, manageable sample for the prototype.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of static analysis:** Gain hands-on experience with code analysis tools and understanding their limitations.
- **Integration of AI/ML in software development:** Learn how to leverage pre-trained models or build small, focused models to enhance software tools.  This will improve understanding of model selection and limitations within a given scope.
