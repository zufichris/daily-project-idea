# Self-Balancing Robotic Platform: PID Control Implementation

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to stabilize a simulated or real-world self-balancing robotic platform (e.g., a Segway-like robot).  The goal is to create a robust controller that maintains balance despite external disturbances.  This is a fundamental challenge in robotics, showcasing classic control theory principles in a practical setting.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID controller), Pygame (for simulation, optional),  RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi hardware control, optional)
- **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit - e.g., MPU6050), motor drivers, small motors.
- **Simulation Environment (Optional):** Pygame for visualization.

## Features & Requirements
- **1. IMU Data Acquisition:**  Read angle and angular velocity data from a simulated or real IMU.
- **2. PID Controller Implementation:** Design and implement a PID controller to adjust motor speeds based on the IMU readings.
- **3. Motor Control:**  Send appropriate control signals to simulated or real motors to maintain balance.
- **4.  Balance Maintenance:** The robot should maintain an upright position despite small external pushes or disturbances.
- **5.  Data Logging (Optional):** Log IMU data and control signals for analysis.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:**  Set up the environment (libraries, hardware connections if using a physical robot).  Create a simulated environment (optional) using Pygame to visualize the robot and its movements.
2. **IMU Data Acquisition:**  Write code to read and process angle and angular velocity data from the IMU (either simulated or real).
3. **PID Controller Design:**  Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve stable balancing.  Start with a simple proportional controller and gradually add integral and derivative terms.
4. **Motor Control Implementation:** Write code to translate the controller output into motor control signals.  This may involve mapping the controller output to motor speeds and directions.
5. **Testing and Tuning:** Test the controller by applying external disturbances (simulated or real). Tune the PID gains iteratively to optimize performance for stability and responsiveness.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments and experimentation.  Start with a simple proportional controller and add integral and derivative terms incrementally.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world IMU data is often noisy. Implementing filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) might be necessary to improve controller performance.

## Learning Outcomes
- **PID Controller Design and Implementation:** This project reinforces the understanding and practical application of PID control algorithms, a cornerstone of control systems engineering.
- **Sensor Integration and Data Processing:** Gain experience in integrating sensor data into a control system and handling real-world sensor noise.
