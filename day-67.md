# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The focus will be on creating a functional AI within a short timeframe, highlighting the core principles of reinforcement learning.  This project is significant because it demonstrates a practical application of a complex AI technique in a manageable context.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- A game library (e.g., Pygame for visualization, or a custom implementation)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -   A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    -   An AI opponent trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).
    -   Basic game logic including win/loss/draw detection.
    -   A simple user interface (CLI or basic GUI).
    -   Training and evaluation modes for the AI.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -   Hyperparameter tuning for the reinforcement learning algorithm.
    -   Saving and loading trained AI models.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the Game Environment:** Create the game logic and basic user interface.  This could be a simple text-based interface for speed.
2. **Implement the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:** Choose a suitable algorithm (Q-learning is recommended for its simplicity) and implement it.
3. **Train the AI:** Run the training process, letting the AI play against itself numerous times to learn optimal strategies.  Limit training iterations to ensure completion within the timeframe.
4. **Evaluate the AI:** Play against the trained AI to assess its performance.
5. **(Optional) Refine and Improve:**  If time allows, tune hyperparameters or add optional features.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  Reinforcement learning can be computationally intensive.  Simplifying the game environment or limiting training iterations is crucial for a short timeframe.
- **Algorithm Selection:**  Choosing the right algorithm and setting appropriate parameters is vital for successful training within the time constraint.  Q-learning's simplicity makes it a good choice for this project.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementation.
- Understanding the process of training an AI agent through self-play.
- Reinforcement of fundamental programming skills and efficient code development within time constraints.
