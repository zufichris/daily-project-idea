#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using reinforcement learning (RL).  The goal is to train a small RL agent to navigate a simulated environment with obstacles, learning to avoid collisions effectively. This is a scaled-down version of a complex problem, making it feasible for a 1-2 day challenge.  The focus will be on demonstrating core RL concepts and achieving basic obstacle avoidance.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **RL Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar like Ray RLlib)
* **Simulation Environment:** PyBullet (simple physics engine for rapid prototyping)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing training progress)

## Features & Requirements

- **Environment Setup:** Create a simple 2D or 3D environment in PyBullet with randomly placed obstacles.
- **Agent Design:** Define a simple agent with actions (e.g., move forward, turn left/right) and observations (e.g., distances to nearest obstacles).
- **RL Training:** Train an RL agent (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) using the chosen library to learn an obstacle avoidance policy.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's performance by measuring its success rate in navigating the environment without collisions.
- **Data Logging:**  Record key metrics during training (e.g., reward, collision rate) for analysis.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a reward shaping mechanism to guide the learning process more effectively.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Integrate a simple camera-based obstacle detection (using simulated camera data within PyBullet).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the environment in PyBullet, including drone model, obstacle placement, and reward function (e.g., rewarding progress and penalizing collisions).
2. **Agent Definition:** Create the RL agent using Stable Baselines3, specifying the action space, observation space, and hyperparameters.
3. **Training:** Run the RL training loop, monitoring progress and saving the trained model periodically. Experiment with different hyperparameters if needed.
4. **Evaluation:** Load the trained model and evaluate its performance in a new, unseen environment with different obstacle configurations.
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  Visualize the training process and agent performance using Matplotlib.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can be challenging and may require experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust gradually.
- **Reward Function Design:**  A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or unexpected agent behavior.  Carefully consider how to incentivize desired actions and penalize undesired ones.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with RL algorithms (e.g., PPO), including agent design, environment setup, training, and evaluation.
- **Simulation and Prototyping:**  Learn how to use PyBullet for rapid prototyping of robotics systems and simulations.
