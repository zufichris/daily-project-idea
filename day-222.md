# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and tuning a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a simulated self-balancing two-wheeled robot.  The goal is to create a stable system that maintains an upright position despite disturbances. This is a fundamental problem in robotics and control systems, offering a practical application for PID tuning skills.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for PID controller), Matplotlib (for visualization)
- **Simulation Environment:**  Pygame (for simple visual representation) or a more advanced physics engine like PyBullet (optional, adds complexity).


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Balance:** The robot should maintain an upright position when initially balanced.
- **Disturbance Recovery:** The robot should recover from small disturbances (e.g., simulated pushes).
- **Real-time Control:** The control loop should run at a reasonable rate (e.g., 60 Hz) to provide responsive feedback.
- **PID Tuning Interface:**  A simple interface (console-based or GUI) to adjust PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Record angle, angular velocity, motor commands for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Robot Model:** Create a simplified 2D model of the robot using vectors/matrices representing its state (angle, angular velocity).  A simple representation is sufficient for a day's project.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID controller algorithm using NumPy. This involves calculating the error, proportional, integral, and derivative terms, and computing the control signal for the motors.
3. **Simulation Loop:** Create a main loop that updates the robot's state based on the PID output, simulates disturbances, and renders the robot's position (using Pygame or similar).
4. **PID Tuning:** Experiment with different Kp, Ki, and Kd values to find optimal settings for stability and responsiveness.  Observe the robot's behavior and adjust accordingly.
5. **(Optional) Data Visualization:** Plot the robot's angle, angular velocity, and motor commands over time using Matplotlib to analyze the controller's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative adjustments. Starting with low gain values and gradually increasing them is recommended.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation affects the controller's performance.  A simplified model is acceptable for a short project, but more advanced simulations might require more time.

## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:**  Reinforce understanding of the PID control algorithm and its parameters.
- **System Modeling & Simulation:** Develop skills in creating simplified models of dynamic systems and simulating their behavior.
