# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple AI agent that learns to play a basic game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Nim) using reinforcement learning. The focus is on rapid prototyping and observing the learning process within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental concept of AI in a tangible and easily understandable way.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  OpenAI Gym (for environment creation, if applicable), TensorFlow/Keras (for reinforcement learning model), NumPy (for numerical computation).
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (either built-in or using OpenAI Gym).
    -  A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning or a simpler approach).
    -  Training loop to allow the agent to learn through playing many games.
    -  Basic visualization of the agent's performance (e.g., win rate over time).
    -  Ability to save and load the trained agent's model.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network).
    -  Integration with a graphical user interface for better visualization.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game rules and create the game environment.  If using OpenAI Gym, select a suitable environment; otherwise, implement a simple game logic in Python.
2. **Agent Design:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (start with Q-learning for simplicity) and implement the agent's logic to interact with the environment.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that allows the agent to play numerous games, updating its policy based on rewards received.
4. **Performance Evaluation:**  Track the agent's performance (e.g., win rate) over time and visualize the learning curve.
5. **Model Saving and Loading:** Implement functionality to save the trained agent's model for later use or further experimentation.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:** Choosing an overly complex algorithm might hinder progress within the given timeframe. Starting with a simpler algorithm and gradually increasing complexity is recommended.
- **Reward Function Design:** Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for effective learning. An improperly designed reward function can lead to unexpected or suboptimal behavior.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., states, actions, rewards, policy).
- Practical experience in implementing and evaluating a simple reinforcement learning agent.
