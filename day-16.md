# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a gesture-recognition system using a low-power microcontroller and a machine learning model trained for a small set of gestures. The system will control a simulated smart home device (e.g., turning lights on/off).  This demonstrates the feasibility of TinyML for resource-constrained environments and provides a practical application of embedded machine learning.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python (for model training and data preprocessing), C++ (for microcontroller firmware).
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (featuring onboard sensors and sufficient processing power).
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro.
* **Sensor:** Onboard accelerometer and gyroscope of the chosen microcontroller.
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE.
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, appropriate Arduino libraries for sensor interaction.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:** The system should accurately capture and preprocess accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- **Model Training:** A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) or a simpler model should be trained to classify a predefined set of gestures (e.g., waving, fist, open hand).
- **Real-time Classification:** The trained model should be deployed on the microcontroller for real-time gesture classification.
- **Smart Home Simulation:**  A basic simulation (e.g., printing to console or using a virtual LED) should respond to the classified gesture.
- **Data Visualization (optional):**  A simple visualization of the sensor data and model output can be added for debugging purposes.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect accelerometer and gyroscope data for each gesture using the microcontroller.  Preprocess this data (e.g., filtering, normalization).
2. **Model Training:** Train a TensorFlow Lite Micro compatible CNN model using the preprocessed data. Export the model in a suitable format (e.g., .tflite).
3. **Microcontroller Programming:** Write C++ code for the microcontroller to read sensor data, run inference using the TensorFlow Lite Micro runtime, and trigger the smart home simulation based on the prediction.
4. **Deployment & Testing:**  Deploy the trained model and firmware onto the microcontroller. Test the system's accuracy and responsiveness.
5. **Refinement (Optional):** Iterate on model training, data acquisition, or firmware based on testing results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:** Gathering sufficient and representative data for reliable model training might be challenging within a limited timeframe. Carefully selecting gestures and ensuring data consistency is crucial.
- **Model Optimization:** Balancing model accuracy with its size and computational cost on the microcontroller is critical for real-time performance.  Model quantization and pruning might be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical TinyML:** Gain hands-on experience with developing and deploying a machine learning model on a resource-constrained device.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:** Enhance skills in C++ programming for embedded systems and interacting with hardware sensors.
