# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking for a Robotic Arm

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple system that uses a camera to detect and track a specific object in real-time, then guides a robotic arm to follow its movement.  This is a scaled-down version of advanced robotic manipulation systems, providing a focused challenge achievable within a short timeframe. The significance lies in demonstrating basic computer vision and robotics integration.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), PySerial (serial communication, if using a physical robotic arm), a robotics library relevant to the chosen robotic arm (e.g., ROS, `RPi.GPIO` for Raspberry Pi).
- **Hardware:**  A webcam or similar camera, a robotic arm (optional, can be simulated), a computer.

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view using color thresholding or a more advanced object detection model (YOLOv5 Tiny).
- **Object Tracking:**  Track the detected object's centroid as it moves.
- **Arm Control (Optional):**  If using a physical robotic arm, control its position to follow the object's tracked position. Simulate robotic arm movement if no physical arm is available.
- **GUI:** Display the camera feed, bounding box around the detected object, and robotic arm position (if simulated or physical).
- **Calibration (Optional):**  Allow for calibration of the camera and robotic arm to account for differences in coordinate systems.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Object Detection:** Set up the camera feed using OpenCV, implement a simple color-based object detection method (or load a pre-trained YOLOv5 Tiny model).
2. **Object Tracking:**  Use OpenCV's tracking functions (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`) to track the detected object's centroid over time.
3. **Arm Control (Simulation or Physical):**  If simulating, create a virtual robotic arm model and update its position based on the object's tracked coordinates. If using a physical arm, send appropriate commands via serial communication (or other method) based on the tracked coordinates.  Map camera coordinates to robotic arm coordinates.
4. **GUI Development:** Create a basic GUI (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt) to display the camera feed and tracking information.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different object movements and lighting conditions. Adjust parameters (e.g., color thresholds, tracking parameters) for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing speed and accuracy in object detection and tracking can be challenging. Consider optimizing code and using less computationally expensive methods for real-time performance.
- **Coordinate System Transformation:**  Mapping camera coordinates to robotic arm coordinates requires careful consideration, potentially involving calibration and coordinate transformations (especially if using a physical robot).


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforces practical skills in computer vision techniques (object detection, tracking).
- Provides experience in integrating computer vision with robotics (or robotics simulation), understanding the challenges of real-time control and coordination.
