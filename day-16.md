# Mini-Game AI Agent using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a basic game (like Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Connect Four) using reinforcement learning. The focus is on creating a functional prototype within a short timeframe, showcasing the core concepts of reinforcement learning.  The significance lies in understanding and applying RL principles to a tangible problem.


## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for the reinforcement learning model)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:**  A functional, playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe is recommended for simplicity).
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An agent that learns through trial and error using a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
- **Training Loop:**  A mechanism to train the agent over a specified number of episodes.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics to track the agent's performance (e.g., win rate, average reward).
- **Visualization (Optional):** Basic visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., a plot of the reward over time).

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implement a different RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN) if time permits).
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Introduce exploration/exploitation strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to improve learning.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment using a library like Gym or build a custom environment in Python.  This includes defining the game state, actions, rewards, and termination conditions.
2. **Agent Design:** Choose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning is a good starting point) and implement the agent's logic for selecting actions based on the current state and learned Q-values.
3. **Training Loop Implementation:** Create a training loop that iteratively allows the agent to play the game, receive rewards, and update its Q-values based on the chosen algorithm.
4. **Evaluation and Tuning:** Evaluate the agent's performance after training and adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) as needed to improve performance.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** If time allows, add basic plotting to visualize the agent's learning progress.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm can be time-consuming.  Start with reasonable defaults and iterate.
- **Environment Complexity:**  While Tic-Tac-Toe is simple, more complex games require more sophisticated RL techniques and potentially longer training times.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts.
- Experience in designing and implementing RL agents.
- Understanding of the trade-offs between different RL algorithms and their hyperparameters.
