# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to develop a basic real-time object tracking and classification system using a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and readily available machine learning libraries. The significance lies in its ability to demonstrate fundamental computer vision techniques within a short timeframe, providing a practical example of embedded AI.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (4 recommended), Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2, power supply.
* **Software:** Raspberry Pi OS (with Python and necessary libraries pre-installed), OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow Lite (or similar lightweight ML framework), potentially a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time video capture:** Acquire video stream from the Raspberry Pi camera.
- **Object detection:** Detect objects within the video frame using a pre-trained model.
- **Object classification:** Classify detected objects into predefined categories.
- **Object tracking:** Track the movement of identified objects across consecutive frames (using optical flow or similar).
- **Display results:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels on the video stream to visualize the results.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple object counting mechanism for specific identified objects.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integrate with a remote server to transmit detected object data for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) on the Raspberry Pi and configure the camera module.
2. **Model Selection & Loading:** Choose a suitable pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD) compatible with TensorFlow Lite and load it efficiently.
3. **Video Processing:** Implement a loop to continuously capture frames from the camera, run object detection/classification on each frame, and track detected objects.
4. **Result Visualization:** Overlay bounding boxes and class labels on the video frames and display the output using OpenCV's window functions.
5. **(Optional) Data Transmission:** If chosen, configure the system to transmit data to a remote server using a suitable protocol (e.g., MQTT).


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational limitations:** The Raspberry Pi may struggle with high-resolution video or complex models.  Consider optimizing the model or reducing the input resolution to maintain real-time performance.
- **Accuracy trade-off:** Pre-trained models might not achieve perfect accuracy for all object types.  Experiment with different models or fine-tune an existing model if higher accuracy is needed (though this might be outside a 1-2 day scope).

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce practical skills in using OpenCV for video processing and image manipulation.
- Gain experience in integrating pre-trained machine learning models into embedded systems for real-time applications.
