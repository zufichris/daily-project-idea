#  Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing a miniature, low-cost camera and a machine learning model to recognize micro-gestures.  The goal is to create a hands-free, intuitive interface for controlling basic smart home functions, such as turning lights on/off or adjusting volume, without requiring large, sweeping motions. The significance lies in exploring the feasibility of deploying such systems in resource-constrained environments or with users who may have limited mobility.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning Library:** TensorFlow Lite/MediaPipe (for gesture recognition)
* **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (or similar SBC) with a low-resolution camera module
* **Development Environment:**  VS Code or similar IDE

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., thumb up/down, index finger point, hand wave) with high accuracy.
- **Real-time Processing:** Process camera feed and classify gestures in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Interface with a simulated smart home environment (e.g., using a library to send commands to virtual devices).
- **Model Training (Optional):** Optionally train a custom model using a small, curated dataset of gesture images if time permits.
- **User Interface:**  Provide a basic visual feedback mechanism (e.g., displaying recognized gesture on screen).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:**  Set up the Raspberry Pi and camera. Acquire a small dataset of example images for each gesture (can use existing publicly available dataset or quickly create one).
2. **Model Selection & Integration:** Choose a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Lite or MediaPipe suitable for hand gesture recognition and integrate it into your Python code.
3. **Real-time Processing & Classification:**  Use OpenCV to capture the camera feed, process the images, feed them to the chosen model for classification, and output the predicted gesture.
4. **Smart Home Simulation:**  Implement basic smart home functionality using a placeholder library that simulates actions like turning lights on/off based on the recognized gestures.
5. **UI Development (Optional):** If time allows, create a simple graphical user interface to display recognized gestures and system status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy & Robustness:** Achieving high accuracy with limited data and potential for variations in lighting conditions and hand poses can be challenging. Addressing this might involve data augmentation techniques or choosing a more robust model.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing real-time processing with accuracy can be difficult, requiring optimization of the model and image processing pipeline.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of real-time image processing and computer vision techniques.
- Practical experience with deploying and integrating pre-trained machine learning models for a specific application.
