# Mini-Game AI Agent using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project involves building a simple AI agent that learns to play a minimalistic game using reinforcement learning (RL). The chosen game will be easily definable and allows for quick prototyping and observation of learning progress.  The focus is on implementing a basic RL algorithm and observing its performance within a constrained timeframe.  This provides a practical application of RL principles and showcases the power of AI in simple game environments.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  PyTorch/TensorFlow (for RL), Pygame (for game development - optional, a simpler text-based game can be used instead)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE.


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:**  A simple 2D game (e.g., grid-based movement with reward/penalty system).  A text-based representation is acceptable for simplicity.
- **RL Agent:**  Implementation of a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
- **Training Loop:**  A function to train the agent iteratively, observing its performance.
- **Reward System:** Define clear rewards and penalties for agent actions within the game environment.
- **Performance Measurement:** Track the agent's cumulative reward over training episodes.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Exploration-exploitation strategies (epsilon-greedy), Deep Q-Network (DQN) for a more complex game.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting cumulative reward over time).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define the Game:** Design a simple game environment with clear rules, actions, states, and reward system (e.g., a grid world where the agent navigates to a goal, avoiding obstacles).  If using Pygame, create a basic visual representation; otherwise, use a text-based representation.
2. **Implement the RL Algorithm:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (Q-learning or SARSA) and implement it using PyTorch/TensorFlow.
3. **Create the Training Loop:** Write a function that iteratively trains the agent, updates its Q-values, and measures its performance.
4. **Train and Evaluate:** Run the training loop for a sufficient number of episodes, observing the agent's learning progress and the cumulative reward.
5. **Analyze Results:** Analyze the agent's performance and identify areas for improvement.  Consider visualizing the results (optional).


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:**  Creating an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behavior can be challenging. Experimentation and iteration may be required.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding the optimal learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate might require experimentation.  Start with reasonable defaults and adjust as needed.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:**  This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like Q-learning, SARSA, reward functions, and the training loop.
- **Practical Application of RL:**  This project provides hands-on experience in implementing and applying RL to a concrete problem, enhancing practical skill development.
