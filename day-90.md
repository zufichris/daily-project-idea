# Mini-Max Agent for a Simple Game

## Overview

This project involves developing a Minimax AI agent to play a simplified version of a two-player board game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four with a smaller board). The goal is to demonstrate the implementation of a classic game-playing AI algorithm within a constrained timeframe, focusing on efficiency and clear code structure.  This provides a practical application of fundamental AI concepts.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  `numpy` (optional, for efficient board representation),  `random` (for opponent simulation in testing)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game board representation (using a list or numpy array).
    -  A Minimax algorithm implementation with alpha-beta pruning (for efficiency).
    -  An interface for human players to interact with the game (simple text-based is sufficient).
    -  The AI agent should play optimally against a human opponent.
    -  Basic win/loss/draw detection.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  A simple graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Pygame.
    -  Implementation of different evaluation functions for the game state.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Board & Rules:** Design a simple, easily representable game board (e.g., a 3x3 array for Tic-Tac-Toe).  Define the rules for winning and drawing.
2. **Minimax Algorithm:** Implement the core Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.  Focus on a recursive implementation for clarity.
3. **Player Interaction:** Create a basic text-based interface allowing a human player to make moves.
4. **Game Loop:** Combine the game board, Minimax agent, and player interaction to create the main game loop.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the AI against both optimal and suboptimal human players to identify and fix bugs or areas for improvement.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Efficiency:**  For larger game boards (e.g., a larger Connect Four board), the Minimax algorithm can become computationally expensive.  Alpha-beta pruning is crucial for mitigating this.  Consider limiting the search depth for larger games if necessary.
- **Code Clarity:** Ensuring the code is well-structured, documented, and easy to understand is paramount, given the time constraint.  Modular design is recommended.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of the Minimax algorithm and its application in game playing.
- Practical experience in algorithm implementation, testing, and debugging within a limited time frame.
