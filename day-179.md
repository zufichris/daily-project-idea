# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera, leveraging WebRTC for efficient video streaming and a lightweight object detection model.  The goal is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for a remote monitoring or augmented reality application where object tracking is crucial. The focus is on speed and simplicity for a short-term challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite (or similar lightweight model), WebRTC (using a suitable Python wrapper), Flask (for a simple web server)
* **Tools:**  A web camera, a suitable development environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Streaming:** Capture video from a webcam and stream it using WebRTC to a local web server.
- **Object Detection:**  Use a pre-trained, lightweight object detection model (e.g., MobileNet SSD) to identify a specific object (e.g., a person, a ball) in the video stream.
- **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple object tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the video stream with bounding boxes around the detected object on a web page.
- **FPS Reporting:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to monitor performance.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Implementing a more sophisticated tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter).
- Adding the capability to detect multiple objects simultaneously.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up WebRTC streaming:** Configure a simple Flask server to receive and handle WebRTC video streams from the client (the webcam).
2. **Integrate Object Detection:** Load a pre-trained object detection model in TensorFlow Lite and integrate it with OpenCV to process the received video frames.
3. **Implement Object Tracking:** Use a tracking algorithm (centroid tracking is easiest) to continuously track the detected object's position across frames.
4. **Create Visual Output:** Display the processed video stream with bounding boxes on a web page using JavaScript.  The server will pass the detection results to the client for display.
5. **Measure and Display FPS:**  Calculate and display the FPS to evaluate performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:** Balancing real-time performance with the accuracy of object detection and tracking might require careful model selection and optimization.  Using a smaller/faster model is crucial.
- **Network Latency:** WebRTC might introduce some latency, impacting the accuracy of tracking. Testing with different network conditions is important.


## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces practical skills in real-time video processing, object detection, and tracking using lightweight models.
- It provides hands-on experience with WebRTC for efficient video streaming and integration with other libraries and tools.
