# Minimax AI for a Simplified Tic-Tac-Toe Variant

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Minimax AI agent for a slightly modified Tic-Tac-Toe game. The modification involves adding a "block" action:  a player can choose to block an opponent's next move by placing a marker adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the opponent's last placement, preventing them from completing a three-in-a-row. This adds a layer of strategic complexity beyond standard Tic-Tac-Toe, making it a challenging yet manageable AI problem for a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:  NumPy (optional, for efficient board representation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - Game board representation (2D array or list).
    - Minimax algorithm implementation with alpha-beta pruning for efficient search.
    - Human vs. AI game play functionality.
    - Win/lose/draw detection.
    - "Block" action implementation and integration into Minimax.

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Difficulty levels adjustable by modifying the search depth of the Minimax algorithm.
    -  Graphical User Interface (GUI) using a simple library like Pygame (optional, adds significant time complexity).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Board Representation and Game Logic:** Design a data structure (e.g., a NumPy array or a list of lists) to represent the game board and implement the game rules, including the "block" action.
2. **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to efficiently evaluate game states and find the optimal move for the AI.
3. **Human-AI Game Loop:** Create a function to handle user input (e.g., via console input) and the AI's turn using the Minimax algorithm.
4. **Win/Lose/Draw Detection:** Implement a function to check for win conditions (three in a row) and draw conditions (board full).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the game against different strategies and refine the AI's performance by adjusting parameters or improving the algorithm.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Efficient Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Implementing alpha-beta pruning effectively is crucial for minimizing the search space and enabling the AI to make decisions within a reasonable timeframe.  Inefficient pruning will lead to slow or unresponsive AI.
- **Handling the "Block" Action:** Integrating the "block" action logically into the heuristic evaluation function within Minimax requires careful consideration of how to score board states with blocking moves.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of Minimax Algorithm:** This project provides hands-on experience implementing and optimizing the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental concept in game AI.
- **Strategic Game AI Design:** Understanding how to design an AI agent for a game with nuanced rules and strategic elements, such as the "block" action, strengthens problem-solving skills in AI development.
