# Mini-Game AI Agent with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple AI agent capable of learning to play a rudimentary game (e.g., a simplified version of Pong or Snake) using reinforcement learning. The focus is on creating a functional prototype showcasing core RL concepts within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in understanding and applying fundamental RL techniques in a practical context.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook (or preferred IDE)

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    -  A functional game environment (simple 2D game).
    -  An AI agent implemented using a basic reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or SARSA).
    -  Training loop to allow the agent to learn from interaction with the environment.
    -  Visualization of agent's performance (e.g., score over time).
    -  Basic agent action space (e.g., left, right, up, down).
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Implementation of a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN)).
    -  Hyperparameter tuning to optimize agent performance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple game environment using Python libraries like Pygame or a custom environment, defining the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a basic RL agent (Q-learning or SARSA) using TensorFlow/Keras or a suitable library.  Define the agent's state representation and action selection strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
3. **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop that iteratively interacts the agent with the environment, updates the agent's knowledge based on rewards received, and tracks performance metrics.
4. **Visualization:** Implement visualization to show the agent's learning progress (e.g., plotting the score over training episodes).
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance by running it against a simple strategy or a random agent.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining an effective reward function that guides the agent towards optimal behaviour can be challenging.  Careful consideration of the game's goals is crucial.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal hyperparameters for the RL algorithm (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) may require experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: Gain practical experience with core RL concepts like state, action, reward, and policy.
- Agent-Environment Interaction: Understand the iterative process of training an RL agent through interaction with an environment.
