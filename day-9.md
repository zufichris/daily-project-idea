# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures to trigger predefined actions, such as turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or launching specific applications. This provides a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional interfaces.  The focus will be on a small, manageable set of gestures for a quick prototype.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), PyAutoGUI (for controlling applications/system).
- **Tools:**  Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., fist, open hand, thumbs up).
- **Action Mapping:**  Map each recognized gesture to a specific smart home action (e.g., fist = turn lights off, open hand = increase volume).
- **Real-time Processing:** Process webcam feed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **User Calibration (Optional):** Allow for user-specific gesture calibration to improve accuracy.
- **Action Confirmation (Optional):** Implement a visual or auditory confirmation upon gesture recognition.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Calibration:** Install necessary libraries. Test webcam feed and adjust lighting for optimal hand detection.  Optionally, implement a simple calibration routine to capture user's baseline hand poses.
2. **Hand Tracking:** Use MediaPipe to track hand landmarks in the webcam feed.  Process the landmark data to extract relevant features for gesture classification.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Implement a simple classifier (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors or a small neural network) to distinguish between predefined gestures based on extracted features.
4. **Action Triggering:**  Based on the classified gesture, trigger the corresponding smart home action using PyAutoGUI (e.g., simulate keyboard presses or mouse clicks).
5. **Refinement & Testing:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and hand poses. Refine the classifier and gesture definition as needed to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy & Robustness:**  Achieving high accuracy in real-time gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in lighting, hand size, and user movement.  Consider using techniques like data augmentation to improve robustness.
- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing can be computationally intensive.  Optimize the code for speed and efficiency to avoid lag.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision:** This project provides hands-on experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand tracking.
- **Develop experience with simple machine learning models for classification:** Building and applying a classifier to recognize gestures strengthens understanding of basic machine learning concepts and model evaluation.
