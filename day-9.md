# Mini-Game AI: Reinforcement Learning for Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to create an agent that can learn optimal strategies through self-play without explicit programming of game rules beyond the basic win/loss/draw conditions.  This provides a practical, contained example of a powerful AI technique.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: `gym` (for reinforcement learning environment), `numpy` (for numerical computation), potentially `matplotlib` (for visualization).


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    -   Creates a Tic-Tac-Toe game environment.
    -   Implements a Q-learning agent.
    -   Trains the agent through self-play.
    -   Evaluates the agent's performance against a random agent.
    -   Provides a simple text-based interface for interaction (optional: GUI).

- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -   Implement a different reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., SARSA).
    -   Visualize the Q-values or training progress.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Define the Tic-Tac-Toe game environment using `gym` or a custom implementation. This involves defining the state space, action space, reward function (win/loss/draw), and game logic.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Implement a Q-learning agent with appropriate hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate).
3. **Training Loop:** Create a training loop where the agent plays against itself numerous times, updating its Q-values based on the outcomes.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained agent's win rate against a random agent.
5. **Refinement (Optional):**  Tune hyperparameters or explore different RL algorithms based on evaluation results.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the Q-learning algorithm may require experimentation. Start with reasonable defaults and iteratively adjust.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions with high Q-values) is crucial for effective learning.  Experiment with different exploration strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy).


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of reinforcement learning concepts like Q-learning, state-action spaces, rewards, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma.
- Gain practical experience in implementing and evaluating a simple RL agent in a well-defined environment.
