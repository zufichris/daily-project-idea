# Automated Code Style Enforcement with AI

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype tool that automatically enforces a specific code style guide using AI, focusing on a single programming language (e.g., Python).  The significance lies in improving code consistency and readability across a team or personal projects, automating a traditionally manual and time-consuming process.  This prototype will focus on a limited subset of style rules for a manageable scope within a daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Trees), scikit-learn (for potential machine learning components if time allows), a chosen linting library (e.g., `flake8`, `pylint`).
* **Tools:**  A code editor (VS Code recommended), a version control system (Git).

## Features & Requirements

- **Rule Definition:**  The tool should allow defining a small set of style rules (e.g., maximum line length, spacing around operators).
- **Code Parsing:**  The tool should parse Python code using the `ast` module to extract relevant structural information.
- **Rule Enforcement:**  The tool should check the parsed code against the defined rules and identify violations.
- **Violation Reporting:**  The tool should report violations with clear and concise messages, including line numbers and the nature of the violation.
- **Simple Output Formatting:** The tool should present a summary of violations.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Basic machine learning to suggest automatic fixes for simple style violations (e.g., adding missing whitespace).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Support for a configuration file to easily customize rules.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Rule Definition & Data Structure:** Define a data structure to represent the style rules (e.g., a dictionary).  Choose 2-3 simple rules for initial implementation.
2. **Code Parsing & Analysis:** Implement the code parsing functionality using the `ast` module.  Write functions to check for violations against the defined rules.
3. **Violation Reporting:**  Implement functions to generate clear and concise reports of violations.
4. **Integration (Optional):** Integrate the tool with a chosen linting library to leverage existing functionality (e.g., reporting).
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the tool with sample code snippets, including both compliant and non-compliant examples.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **AST Complexity:**  Handling the complexities of the AST for more sophisticated style rules can be challenging.  Start with simple rules and gradually increase complexity.
- **Rule Coverage:**  Achieving comprehensive style rule coverage within a day is unlikely.  Focus on a small, well-defined subset.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs):** This project provides hands-on experience with parsing and manipulating code using ASTs.
- **Improve skills in code analysis and static analysis:** This project strengthens practical skills in building tools to analyze code for adherence to coding standards.
