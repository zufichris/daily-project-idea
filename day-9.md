# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize predefined hand gestures, translating them into commands for controlling smart home devices. This offers a hands-free, intuitive alternative to traditional voice or app-based control, prioritizing ease of use and accessibility.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), a suitable Smart Home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Tools:** Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:** The system must accurately recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, open palm).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Gesture recognition should happen in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Device Control:**  Recognized gestures should trigger pre-defined actions, such as turning lights on/off or adjusting the thermostat.
- **Calibration:**  A simple calibration routine to adjust sensitivity to individual users' hand sizes and movements.
- **User Interface:** A basic visual feedback mechanism indicating gesture recognition.


- **Advanced Feature:** Gesture sequence recognition (e.g., a specific sequence for complex actions).
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a voice assistant for verbal commands.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Calibration:** Install necessary libraries and set up the webcam.  Implement a simple calibration routine to account for variations in lighting and hand size.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe and train a simple model (or use pre-trained models) to recognize the chosen gestures.
3. **Action Mapping:** Define a mapping between recognized gestures and corresponding smart home commands.
4. **API Integration:**  Integrate with a chosen smart home API to send commands to control connected devices.
5. **Feedback & Testing:** Implement basic visual feedback (e.g., on-screen text) and test the system's accuracy and responsiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of hand tracking. Robust error handling is crucial.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  The system needs to reliably differentiate between similar gestures. Careful gesture selection and potentially more advanced machine learning models are needed.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:** Hands-on experience using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Integration of Different APIs:**  Experience integrating a computer vision model with a third-party smart home API, developing skills in inter-system communication.
