# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling smart home devices using subtle hand gestures captured by a webcam.  The focus will be on recognizing a small set of predefined micro-gestures, providing a contactless and intuitive interface. This project's significance lies in exploring efficient, real-time gesture recognition without requiring complex, high-resolution depth sensors often used in similar applications.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (Hands solution), TensorFlow Lite (optional for model optimization)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a suitable IDE, a webcam


## Features & Requirements
- **Gesture Capture:** Real-time capture of hand gestures from a webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognition of at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., a flick for turning lights on/off, a wave for adjusting volume, a pinch for pausing music).
- **Device Control:** Simple integration with a smart home simulator or API (e.g., a mock API for testing purposes).
- **User Interface:** Basic visual feedback displaying recognized gestures.
- **Accuracy Tracking:** Log recognition accuracy for evaluation and further development.

- **Advanced Features:**  Incorporation of a simple machine learning model (e.g., a small CNN) to improve recognition accuracy.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a real smart home ecosystem (requires API access).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:** Install necessary libraries, test webcam connectivity, and capture a small dataset of example gestures for each predefined action.
2. **Gesture Detection:** Implement MediaPipe Hands solution to detect and track hand landmarks in the webcam feed.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from hand landmarks (e.g., distances, angles, relative positions).  Simple features will suffice for a daily challenge.
4. **Gesture Classification:**  Implement a simple rule-based classifier or a lightweight machine learning model (if using the advanced feature) to classify the extracted features.
5. **Device Control Integration:**  Send commands to a smart home simulator or API based on classified gestures.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness to Noise:**  Hand gestures may be affected by lighting conditions, background clutter, or hand occlusion.  Preprocessing techniques (e.g., background subtraction) may be necessary.
- **Accuracy vs. Simplicity:** Balancing model complexity against the limited time constraints.  A rule-based approach might be more efficient for a day's work.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Real-time computer vision:** Gain practical experience with real-time image processing using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Gesture recognition fundamentals:**  Learn to design, implement, and evaluate a simple gesture recognition system.
