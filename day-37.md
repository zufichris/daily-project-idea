# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a smart home device control system using a webcam and simple hand gestures.  The system will recognize predefined gestures (e.g., hand wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for increasing volume, thumbs down for decreasing volume) and translate them into commands to control a smart home device simulator (or a real device if available). This project focuses on the core gesture recognition aspect and provides a foundation for more complex interactions in the future.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), potentially a simple HTTP library (requests) for smart home device simulation.
* **Tools:**  Webcam, a Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), potentially a smart home simulator (e.g., Home Assistant API, a simple mock server).


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Accurate recognition of at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., wave, thumbs up, thumbs down).
- **Command Translation:** Mapping recognized gestures to specific commands (e.g., wave -> toggle lights, thumbs up -> increase volume).
- **Device Control Simulation:**  Implementation of a simple simulator that receives commands and provides visual feedback (e.g., printing the received command to the console, simulating light on/off).
- **Real-time Processing:** Processing the webcam feed in real-time to provide immediate feedback to the user.
- **User Interface (Basic):** A simple console output displaying the recognized gesture and the corresponding command.

- **Advanced Feature 1:** Implementing a simple GUI using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Integration with a real smart home device API (e.g., Philips Hue, IFTTT).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, requests if needed). Set up a webcam and test its functionality.
2. **Hand Tracking:** Implement hand tracking using MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks in the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture Recognition:**  Develop a simple logic to classify detected hand poses into predefined gestures based on landmark positions.  This might involve simple thresholding or distance calculations.
4. **Command Translation & Device Control Simulation:** Map recognized gestures to commands and implement a simple simulator to receive and process these commands.  Print the command to the console.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various hand gestures and adjust the recognition logic to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition might be challenging due to variations in lighting, hand positions, and individual hand sizes.  Consider using more robust classification techniques if time permits.
- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing real-time processing with accuracy can be challenging.  Optimize code for speed if needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** This project provides practical experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand tracking.
- **Develop skills in building a simple real-time interactive application:**  The project involves integrating different components (webcam feed, gesture recognition, command processing) to create a functional application.
