#  Miniature Robotic Arm Calibration via Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified calibration procedure for a miniature robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to create a program that automatically calibrates the arm's end-effector position based on visual input from a camera, minimizing manual setup time and improving accuracy.  This is relevant to various applications involving small-scale automation and robotics, such as micro-assembly or educational robotics kits.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm control library (depending on the specific hardware used, e.g., a library for Arduino control).
* **Hardware:** Miniature robotic arm (e.g., a 3-DOF or 4-DOF arm), Webcam or similar camera.
* **Tools:**  A chessboard or similar pattern for calibration, a suitable workspace for the robotic arm.

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera to determine intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
- **Target Detection:** Detect a known target (e.g., a colored marker) placed at the end-effector.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK) Estimation (Simplified):**  Estimate the robot arm's joint angles based on the detected target position in camera coordinates (simplified IK solution may be sufficient for a small degree-of-freedom arm).
- **Joint Angle Control:** Send calculated joint angles to the robotic arm to position the end-effector.
- **Error Calculation and Refinement (Optional):** Measure the difference between the desired and actual end-effector position and adjust the IK solution iteratively.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a more robust error correction mechanism using a closed-loop control system.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Incorporate support for different camera types and target patterns.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration and Target Detection:** Use OpenCV to calibrate the camera and detect the target marker on the robot's end-effector.
2. **Coordinate Transformation:** Transform the target's 2D camera coordinates into 3D world coordinates.
3. **Simplified Inverse Kinematics:**  Implement a simplified IK algorithm (e.g., geometric solution for a simple 2-DOF arm) to calculate the joint angles needed to position the end-effector at the target location.  Consider pre-computed solutions or look-up tables for speed.
4. **Arm Control:** Send the calculated joint angles to the robotic arm using the appropriate control library.
5. **Verification:** Verify the accuracy of the calibration by comparing the actual end-effector position with the desired position.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Inverse Kinematics:** The accuracy of the IK solution is crucial. Simplifications may introduce errors, especially for more complex arm geometries. Consider using a more sophisticated IK algorithm if time permits.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can affect target detection.  Use robust image processing techniques to mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** Camera calibration, feature detection, and coordinate transformations are essential skills for robotic applications.
- **Gain practical experience with robotic arm control:** Learn how to interface with robotic hardware and implement control algorithms.
