# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI agent using reinforcement learning to play a rudimentary game.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core RL concepts within a short timeframe. The game will be minimalistic, allowing for quick iteration and experimentation with different RL algorithms. This provides a practical exercise in applying a powerful AI technique to a tangible problem.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Reinforcement Learning Library: Stable Baselines3 (or similar like RLlib)
- Game Engine: Pygame (for simplicity)
- IDE: VS Code or PyCharm

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Features:**
    - A simple 2D game environment (e.g., a maze navigation or a simple platformer).
    - An AI agent trained using a chosen RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C).
    - Real-time visualization of the agent's performance within the game.
    - Basic reward system to guide the agent's learning.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize agent performance.
    - Implementation of a different RL algorithm for comparison.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Environment Design:** Create a basic game environment using Pygame. This could be a simple maze or a small platformer level.  Define the state space (agent's position, etc.) and action space (movement options).
2. **RL Algorithm Selection & Integration:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., PPO from Stable Baselines3). Integrate the chosen algorithm with the game environment.  This involves defining the reward function and connecting the agent's actions to the game's state changes.
3. **Training and Evaluation:** Train the AI agent using the chosen algorithm for a limited number of iterations (depending on available time).  Regularly evaluate the agent's performance (e.g., average reward per episode).
4. **Visualization & Refinement:** Visualize the agent's actions and learning progress within the game environment.  Based on the results, refine the reward function, hyperparameters, or the RL algorithm itself for improved performance.
5. **Documentation:** Briefly document the chosen approach, results, and any insights gained during the process.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Design:** Defining a meaningful reward function that effectively guides the agent's learning can be challenging.  Experimentation and iteration are key.
- **Training Time:**  Reinforcement learning can be computationally expensive.  The scope of the game and training duration must be carefully balanced for completion within the allotted time.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Experience with designing and implementing a simple game environment.
- Understanding of the challenges and trade-offs involved in training AI agents.
