# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Robot Arm

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated robotic arm within a constrained environment.  The goal is to find the shortest and most collision-free path for the arm to reach a target point, considering the arm's physical limitations (joint angles, link lengths). This has applications in robotics simulation, automation, and industrial control.  The daily challenge will focus on optimizing the algorithm for speed and efficiency.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy (for numerical computation), Matplotlib (for visualization), Pygame (for basic simulation and visualization - optional), a pathfinding library like `pathfinding` or a custom implementation.

## Features & Requirements

- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implement a suitable pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT) to find a collision-free path for the robotic arm.
- **Collision Detection:**  Implement basic collision detection between the arm links and obstacles in the simulated environment.
- **Joint Limits:**  Incorporate constraints on the robot arm's joint angles.
- **Path Visualization:** Visualize the planned path using Matplotlib or Pygame.
- **Path Optimization:**  Measure the path length and attempt to optimize the path by adjusting parameters of the algorithm or using heuristics.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a dynamic obstacle avoidance feature (obstacles move during path execution).
- **Optional Feature:**  Use a more sophisticated physics engine (PyBullet) for a more realistic simulation.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Set up the project environment, install necessary libraries, and define the robot arm's kinematics (link lengths, joint limits). Define a simple 2D environment with obstacles.
2. **Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the chosen pathfinding algorithm (A* is recommended for its balance of speed and completeness).
3. **Collision Detection Implementation:**  Implement a basic collision detection system, checking for intersections between the arm links and obstacles.
4. **Path Visualization:** Visualize the environment, obstacles, and the calculated path.
5. **Optimization:**  Experiment with different algorithm parameters (heuristics, step size) to reduce path length or improve computation time.  Measure the performance before and after optimization.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Finding an optimal path in a complex environment can be computationally expensive.  Choosing an efficient algorithm and optimizing its parameters are crucial.
- **Collision Detection Accuracy:**  Implementing robust collision detection that accounts for the arm's shape and movement can be challenging.  Approximations may be necessary for a quick prototype.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding of pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT) and their implementation.
- Gain experience in implementing and optimizing algorithms for computational efficiency in a practical context.
