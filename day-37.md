# Self-Calibrating Robotic Gripper Control

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a self-calibrating control system for a robotic gripper using sensor feedback. The goal is to create a system that can adapt its grip strength and position based on the object being grasped, minimizing the need for precise pre-programming and improving robustness.  This is significant because it enhances the adaptability and reliability of robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Robotics Framework:** ROS (Robot Operating System) - optional, but highly recommended for ease of integration with existing robotic systems.
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for numerical computation and optimization), potentially a ROS-compatible library for your specific gripper.
* **Hardware:** A robotic gripper with force/torque sensors (or alternative sensors like proximity sensors), a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino), and a computer for control.  Simulation can replace physical hardware.
* **Software:** Gazebo (optional - for robotic simulation).

## Features & Requirements

- **Force/Torque Sensing and Feedback:** The system should read force/torque sensor data to determine the grip strength.
- **Adaptive Grip Adjustment:** The system should adjust the gripper's position and pressure based on sensor readings to maintain a secure grip without crushing the object.
- **Object Detection (Optional):** Implement basic object detection (e.g., using image processing) to inform grip strategy.
- **Self-Calibration Routine:** Develop a routine to automatically calibrate the gripper's sensor readings and control parameters.
- **Safety Mechanism:** Implement a safety mechanism to release the grip if excessive force is detected.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Set up the connection between the microcontroller and the computer. Read and process sensor data (force/torque) from the gripper.
2. **Control Algorithm Development:** Develop a simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller or a more advanced control algorithm (e.g., model predictive control) to adjust the gripper's position and pressure based on sensor feedback.
3. **Self-Calibration Implementation:**  Implement a self-calibration routine to adjust controller gains based on initial sensor readings and a known object (e.g., a calibration weight).
4. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the control algorithm with the gripper and test its performance with various objects.
5. **Safety Implementation:** Add a safety mechanism (e.g., a maximum force limit) to prevent damage to the object or the gripper.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Sensor Noise:**  Dealing with noise in sensor readings is crucial. Implement filtering techniques (e.g., moving average filter) to improve accuracy.
- **Control Algorithm Tuning:** Fine-tuning the control algorithm parameters (e.g., PID gains) may require iterative testing and adjustment.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of robotic control systems:**  This project provides practical experience in designing and implementing a real-time control system for a robotic manipulator.
- **Develop proficiency in sensor integration and data processing:** This involves working with sensor data, filtering noise, and using the data to inform control decisions.
