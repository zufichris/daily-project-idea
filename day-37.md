# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for a Mobile Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple yet robust system for real-time object detection and tracking using a mobile robot platform (simulated or physical). The goal is to enable the robot to identify and follow a specific object (e.g., a colored ball) within its field of view, demonstrating fundamental computer vision and robotics concepts.  This is significant because it's a foundational step in more complex autonomous navigation and manipulation tasks.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
* **Robotics Framework (Optional):** ROS (Robot Operating System), Pygame (for simulation)
* **Hardware (Optional):** A mobile robot platform with a camera (e.g., Raspberry Pi with a camera module)

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:** The system should accurately detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in a camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:**  The system should track the detected object's position across frames.
- **Robot Control (Optional):** The system should control the robot's movement (using simulated or real motor controls) to follow the tracked object.
- **Distance Estimation (Optional):** The system should estimate the distance to the tracked object using camera geometry (requires calibration).
- **User Interface:**  A simple display showing the detected object and relevant data (position, distance).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Object Detection Pipeline:** Implement object detection using OpenCV's color filtering or a simpler machine learning model (e.g., a pre-trained model for object detection).  Focus on efficient processing for real-time performance.
2. **Object Tracking:**  Use OpenCV's tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter, optical flow) to track the detected object's movement across frames.
3. **Robot Control (Optional):** If using a real robot, integrate the tracking data with the robot's control system. For simulation, use Pygame to simulate robot movement based on the object's position.
4. **Distance Estimation (Optional):**  If desired, calibrate the camera and implement distance estimation using techniques like stereo vision or perspective projection.
5. **User Interface:** Create a simple visualization using OpenCV or another suitable library.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing requires efficient algorithms and potentially optimized code to avoid delays.  Consider using hardware acceleration if available.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect object detection accuracy. Robustness to different lighting conditions should be considered.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Image Processing:** Gain experience in using OpenCV for efficient real-time image processing tasks.
- **Object Tracking Algorithms:** Learn and implement various object tracking algorithms and understand their strengths and weaknesses.
