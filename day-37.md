# Automated Code Style Enforcer for Python

## Overview

This project aims to create a command-line tool that automatically enforces a specific Python code style (e.g., PEP 8) on a given codebase. The tool will analyze the code, identify style violations, and optionally auto-correct them.  This is significant for maintaining code consistency and readability within a team or personal project.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `ast` (for Abstract Syntax Tree parsing), `pycodestyle` (for style checking), `autopep8` (for automatic style correction), `argparse` (for command-line argument handling).

## Features & Requirements

- **Code Style Analysis:** Analyze a Python file or directory for style violations based on a configurable style guide (defaulting to PEP 8).
- **Violation Reporting:**  Clearly report the line number, violation type, and a brief description for each detected issue.
- **Auto-correction (Optional):**  Automatically fix detectable style violations.
- **Configurable Style Guide:** Allow users to specify a custom style guide or choose from predefined options.
- **Output Formatting:** Provide output in a human-readable format (e.g., terminal output) and potentially a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON).

- **Advanced Feature:** Integrate with a version control system (like Git) to automatically stage corrected files.
- **Optional Feature:**  Support for multiple Python versions and virtual environments.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Library Import:** Create a Python project, install necessary libraries (`pip install pycodestyle autopep8 argparse`), and import them.
2. **Style Analysis Engine:** Implement the core logic to parse the Python code using `ast`, check for style violations using `pycodestyle`, and collect violation details.
3. **Reporting and Correction:** Create functions to format and display the violation report. Integrate `autopep8` for auto-correction functionality (optional).
4. **Command-line Interface:** Use `argparse` to create a user-friendly command-line interface for specifying input files/directories, style guides, and enabling/disabling auto-correction.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the tool with various code examples, handling edge cases and potential errors.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Handling Complex Code Structures:**  Parsing and analyzing complex Python code structures (e.g., nested functions, class definitions) might require careful handling of the `ast` module.
- **Auto-correction Limitations:**  `autopep8` might not be able to correct all style violations automatically; some manual intervention might still be necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of Python's `ast` module:** Gain practical experience with abstract syntax tree parsing for code analysis.
- **Master command-line argument parsing with `argparse`:** Develop proficiency in creating user-friendly command-line interfaces.
