# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning. The goal is to implement a basic Q-learning algorithm to train the AI within a short timeframe, showcasing a practical application of RL principles. The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental machine learning concept in a concise, playable context.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  NumPy,  OpenAI Gym (optional, for pre-built game environments), Pygame (for visualization)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Logic:** Implement the core game rules (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four) for both human and AI players.
- **Q-learning Agent:** Develop a Q-learning algorithm to train the AI's decision-making process.
- **Training Loop:**  Implement a training loop that iteratively improves the AI's Q-table through self-play.
- **Game Interface:**  A simple text-based or graphical (Pygame) interface to play against the AI.
- **Performance Evaluation:**  Track and display the AI's win rate during or after training.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for more robust training.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Visualize the Q-table or agent's policy after training.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Logic & Environment:** Implement the core game logic and create functions to determine game states (win, lose, draw).  If using OpenAI Gym, skip this step.
2. **Q-learning Algorithm:** Implement the Q-learning update rule and create a Q-table to store state-action values.
3. **Training Loop:**  Write a loop that runs numerous games, updating the Q-table based on the AI's actions and rewards.
4. **Game Interface (Optional):** If time permits, create a simple text or graphical interface to interact with the AI.
5. **Evaluation & Refinement:**  Evaluate the AI's performance and potentially adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor) for better results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Training a robust AI in a short timeframe might require compromises on the number of training iterations.  Focus on finding an appropriate balance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  The performance of Q-learning is sensitive to hyperparameters. Experimentation might be necessary to find optimal settings within the time constraint.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces understanding of core RL concepts like Q-learning, state-action spaces, rewards, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
- **Python Programming & Libraries:**  This project solidifies skills in Python, NumPy, and potentially OpenAI Gym or Pygame, depending on the chosen implementation.
