# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to implement a basic Q-learning algorithm to train the AI within a day, demonstrating a fundamental concept in AI development.  The project emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative improvement.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pygame (for visualization, optional), and a reinforcement learning library like `gym` or a custom implementation.

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - A playable game environment (Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four).
    - An AI opponent using a Q-learning algorithm.
    - A simple reward system (e.g., +1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for a draw).
    - Ability to display the game state (optional, using Pygame).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    -  Exploration-exploitation balance tuning using epsilon-greedy strategy.
    -  Persistence of the learned Q-table for future use.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Environment:** Create a basic representation of the game board and rules in Python.  This can be a simple data structure (e.g., a list or NumPy array).
2. **Q-Learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm. This involves defining the state space, action space, and the Q-table.  Focus on a basic implementation initially.
3. **Training Loop:**  Create a training loop that iteratively plays the game, updates the Q-table based on rewards, and gradually improves the AI's performance.
4. **Testing and Evaluation:** Play against the AI to evaluate its performance. Observe its decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.
5. **(Optional) Visualization:** If using Pygame, integrate it to visualize the game and the AI's actions.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  For larger state spaces (e.g., more complex games), training might require significant time.  Consider simplifying the game or optimizing the Q-learning algorithm for faster training within the timeframe.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:**  Finding the optimal balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions can significantly impact the AI's learning speed and effectiveness.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** This project reinforces the core concepts of Q-learning, including state-action pairs, rewards, and the update rule.
- **Rapid Prototyping:**  The project emphasizes building and iterating quickly, focusing on core functionality first and adding advanced features later as time permits.
