# Self-Balancing Robot Control Algorithm Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing a control algorithm for a self-balancing two-wheeled robot.  The goal is to improve the robot's stability and responsiveness by implementing and comparing different control strategies within a limited timeframe.  This is significant as it touches upon fundamental concepts in robotics control systems and allows for rapid iteration and experimentation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- Robotics Simulator: PyBullet (or similar, e.g., V-REP)
- (Optional) Microcontroller: Arduino (if implementing on a physical robot)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Implement a basic PID controller for balancing.
    - Implement a complementary filter for sensor fusion (accelerometer and gyroscope).
    - Implement a control loop to maintain upright posture.
    - Simulate robot movement using PyBullet.
    - Data logging and visualization of sensor readings and control outputs.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    - Implement a more advanced control algorithm (e.g., LQR, Kalman filter).
    - Add obstacle avoidance capabilities (using simulated sensors).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup & Simulation:** Set up PyBullet and create a simple two-wheeled robot model.  Implement basic sensor models (accelerometer and gyroscope).
2. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement a PID controller to control the motor speeds based on the robot's tilt angle and angular velocity.
3. **Sensor Fusion:** Implement a complementary filter to combine accelerometer and gyroscope data for more accurate angle estimation.
4. **Control Loop Integration:** Integrate the PID controller and sensor fusion into a control loop that runs within the simulation.
5. **Testing & Optimization:** Test the robot's performance and tune the PID gains for optimal stability and responsiveness.  Analyze logged data to identify areas for improvement.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Parameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with conservative gains and gradually increase them while monitoring stability.
- **Sensor Noise:** Real-world sensor data is noisy.  Understanding the impact of noise and using appropriate filtering techniques is crucial.  The simulator might not perfectly represent this, necessitating careful interpretation of results.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforced Concepts:**  Understanding and implementing PID control, sensor fusion techniques (complementary filter), and control system design.
- **Developed Skills:**  Proficiency in using robotics simulation tools, data logging, analysis, and algorithm optimization techniques.
