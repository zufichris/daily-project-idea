# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple but functional real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera and WebRTC for streaming.  The system will detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) and track its movement across the camera's field of view, displaying the tracked object's location on a web interface. This project leverages readily available tools and libraries, making it feasible for a short development cycle while exposing developers to relevant technologies in computer vision and real-time communication.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite (for object detection model), WebRTC (e.g., `aiortc`), Flask (for web server)
* **Tools:**  A web camera, a suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm),  a browser (Chrome, Firefox).  Pre-trained object detection model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system detects a specified object in the video stream from the webcam.
- **Object Tracking:** The system tracks the detected object's position frame-by-frame.
- **WebRTC Streaming:** The processed video stream (with object tracking overlay) is streamed to a web browser in real-time.
- **Web UI:**  A simple web interface displays the live video stream.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Basic FPS display to assess the system's performance.

- **Advanced Features:** Integration with a cloud-based object storage for recording videos, implementation of a more sophisticated tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter).
- **Optional Feature:**  Adding a feature to estimate the object's distance from the camera.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment & Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Lite, aiortc, Flask). Download/load a pre-trained object detection model.
2. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Implement the object detection using the chosen model and OpenCV.  Integrate a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking).
3. **WebRTC Integration:** Use `aiortc` to create a WebRTC server that streams the processed video (with object bounding boxes) to the client.
4. **Web UI Development:** Create a simple HTML page using JavaScript to receive and display the WebRTC stream.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the complete system and optimize for performance, adjusting the object detection model or tracking algorithm as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:** Achieving real-time performance requires careful optimization, potentially involving model selection, reducing image resolution, or employing hardware acceleration.
- **Network Conditions:** The reliability of WebRTC streaming depends on network conditions.  Consider implementing error handling and buffering mechanisms.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time video processing:** Gain practical experience in using OpenCV for real-time video processing, including object detection and tracking.
- **WebRTC application development:**  Learn to use WebRTC for building a real-time video streaming application.  Understanding the intricacies of peer-to-peer communication will be invaluable.
