# TinyML-Powered Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a tinyML-powered gesture recognition system that can control basic smart home functions.  The system will utilize a microcontroller with onboard machine learning capabilities to recognize a small set of predefined gestures captured via an accelerometer or IMU sensor, translating them into commands for a smart home device (e.g., turning lights on/off). This provides a practical application of tinyML and demonstrates the feasibility of edge-based computation for resource-constrained devices.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with built-in accelerometer and machine learning capabilities).
* **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE with TensorFlow Lite Micro libraries.
* **Sensor:**  Onboard accelerometer of the chosen microcontroller. (External IMU could be added for higher accuracy).
* **Development Environment:**  Arduino IDE.
* **Machine Learning Model:**  A simple model trained using a small dataset of gesture data (e.g., wave for on, fist for off).  Pre-trained models or TensorFlow Lite Model Maker could speed up the process.

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Data Acquisition:**  Collect accelerometer data for predefined gestures (e.g., wave, fist).
- **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., k-nearest neighbors or a small neural network) using collected data.
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition:**  Implement real-time inference on the microcontroller to classify incoming accelerometer data.
- **Smart Home Integration:**  Interface with a simple smart home device (e.g., a smart bulb via WiFi or Bluetooth) to execute commands based on recognized gestures.
- **User Interface:** Minimalistic LED indicator to show gesture recognition status.


- **Advanced Features:** Calibration routine for improved accuracy; Support for multiple users (potentially).
- **Optional Features:**  Voice feedback confirming the executed command.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collect accelerometer data for 2-3 distinct gestures.  Preprocess data (e.g., smoothing, normalization).
2. **Model Training & Conversion:** Train a simple TensorFlow Lite Micro compatible model using the collected data. Convert the trained model to a format compatible with the microcontroller.
3. **Microcontroller Programming:** Integrate the model into the Arduino sketch. Implement real-time data acquisition, inference, and actuation logic.
4. **Smart Home Integration:**  Establish communication with the chosen smart home device and implement commands execution based on the inference results.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system and fine-tune the model or data preprocessing as needed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection:** Gathering sufficient, high-quality data for accurate model training might be challenging in a short timeframe.  Carefully choosing the gestures and recording methods is key.
- **Model Optimization:**  Balancing model accuracy and performance on the resource-constrained microcontroller may require careful experimentation with different models and hyperparameters.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of TinyML:** Gain hands-on experience with deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained microcontrollers.
- **Sensor data processing and model integration:**  Develop skills in handling sensor data, training simple ML models, and integrating them into embedded systems.
