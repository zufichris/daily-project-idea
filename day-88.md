#  Smart Home Energy Optimization using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic prototype of a smart home energy optimization system that learns user energy consumption patterns and suggests optimal energy-saving strategies.  The focus will be on a single appliance (e.g., air conditioner) to keep the scope manageable for a 1-2 day challenge.  The significance lies in applying machine learning to real-time data for immediate energy efficiency improvements.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Library: scikit-learn (for simple regression/classification)
- Data Acquisition: Simulated data (initially) or a simple API to retrieve energy consumption data from a smart plug (if available).
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Features & Requirements
- **Data Acquisition:**  Collect energy consumption data (power usage) over time.  This can be simulated initially for ease of development.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Use a machine learning model (linear regression or a simple decision tree) to identify patterns in energy usage based on time of day and day of week.
- **Optimization Suggestion:** Based on learned patterns, suggest optimal settings (e.g., temperature adjustment for AC) to minimize energy consumption while maintaining user comfort.
- **Visualization:** Display energy usage patterns and optimization suggestions through simple charts and graphs.
- **Real-time Feedback:** (Optional) Integrate with a smart plug to send commands (temperature adjustments).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Simulate energy data or integrate with a smart plug API. Clean and format the data for machine learning.
2. **Model Training:** Choose a suitable machine learning model (e.g., linear regression) and train it on the preprocessed data to predict energy consumption based on time and other relevant factors.
3. **Optimization Strategy:** Develop a simple algorithm to suggest optimal settings based on the model's predictions, considering user comfort levels (e.g., a small temperature increase during off-peak hours).
4. **Visualization and User Interface:** Create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Matplotlib or a lightweight library to display data, predictions, and optimization suggestions.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with simulated data or real-world data and refine the model and optimization strategy based on the results.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Data Quality:**  If using real-world data, ensure the data is reliable and free of errors or outliers.  Simulated data allows for controlled experimentation.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right machine learning model can be tricky. Start with a simple model and iterate.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement of machine learning concepts, specifically regression or classification algorithms.
- Practical experience with data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, and deployment in a real-world context (simulated or real).
