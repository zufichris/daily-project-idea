# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling smart home devices using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model.  The focus will be on creating a simple, yet functional system capable of controlling basic appliances like lights and fans. This is significant as it showcases a more intuitive and accessible interface for interacting with smart homes, especially for users with limited mobility.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking),  a relevant library for controlling smart home devices (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Hardware:** Webcam (or any camera capable of streaming video)
* **Software:**  Suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), a smart home device or simulator.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately detect and classify pre-defined hand gestures (e.g., open palm for on, fist for off).
- **Smart Home Device Control:**  Successful gesture recognition triggers corresponding actions on chosen smart home devices (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting fan speed).
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple visual interface displaying recognized gestures and current device status.
- **Calibration:** Allow for easy calibration to account for variations in lighting and camera position.
- **Gesture Library:**  Include functionality to add or modify recognized gestures.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Voice Control Integration: Incorporate speech recognition for additional control options.
- Multiple User Support: Identify individual users and adapt gesture commands based on user profiles.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the camera feed.
2. **Implement Hand Tracking:** Integrate MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time video stream.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Train a simple classifier (e.g., using a decision tree or k-NN) to map detected hand landmarks to pre-defined gestures.
4. **Smart Home Integration:** Connect the gesture recognition module to your chosen smart home platform (e.g., API calls to Home Assistant).
5. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI to display the recognized gestures and smart home device status.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Variations in hand size, lighting conditions, and camera angles can impact the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Consider implementing robust preprocessing techniques and potentially a more advanced machine learning model if time permits.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing video frames and sending commands to smart home devices need to be performed efficiently to ensure real-time response. Optimization may be required.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Application:** Hands-on experience in applying computer vision techniques for real-world problem-solving.
- **Real-time System Development:**  Understanding challenges and strategies for building responsive applications involving continuous data streams.
