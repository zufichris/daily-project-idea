# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robotic Object Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet effective AI-powered image caption generator specifically tailored to improve object recognition for robotic applications.  The system will take an image as input, process it using a pre-trained model, and generate a concise, descriptive caption identifying the objects present. This can be valuable for robots navigating unfamiliar environments or performing object manipulation tasks.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- A pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or similar)
- Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE


## Features & Requirements
- **Image Input:** The system should accept image input from a file path or a live camera feed.
- **Caption Generation:**  The system should generate a human-readable caption describing the objects and their attributes (e.g., "A red ball, a blue cube, and a green toy car").
- **Confidence Score:**  Display a confidence score for the generated caption indicating the model's certainty.
- **Object Localization (Optional):**  Highlight detected objects within the image with bounding boxes.
- **Output Formatting:** Provide the caption and confidence score in a clear and easily readable format.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries and download a pre-trained image captioning model.
2. **Image Processing:** Implement image loading and preprocessing (resizing, normalization) using OpenCV.
3. **Caption Generation:** Integrate the pre-trained model to generate captions from the processed images.
4. **Output Display:** Display the image, generated caption, and confidence score.  Implement optional bounding boxes if chosen.
5. **Testing:** Test the system with various images to evaluate accuracy and performance.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Model Accuracy:** Pre-trained models might not be perfectly accurate for all object types.  Addressing this might require fine-tuning or selecting a more specialized model.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Achieving real-time caption generation with complex images may be challenging. Consider optimizing the model and image processing pipeline for speed.

## Learning Outcomes
- This project reinforces practical skills in integrating pre-trained machine learning models into applications.
- It provides experience in image processing, model selection, and performance optimization for a robotics-related task.
