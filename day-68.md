#  Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a micro-gesture recognition system that can control smart home devices.  The system will use a readily available computer vision library to process webcam input, identifying simple hand gestures to trigger pre-defined actions, such as turning lights on/off or adjusting the thermostat.  This is significant as it explores a more intuitive and less intrusive method of interaction with smart home technology compared to voice commands or touchscreens.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), potentially a lightweight machine learning library like scikit-learn for gesture classification (if time allows).
- **Tools:** A webcam, a laptop/desktop computer.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurately track hand positions and orientations from the webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, pointing).
- **Smart Home Integration (Simulated):**  Simulate smart home device control using print statements or simple GUI updates reflecting the triggered action.  (E.g., "Lights ON," "Thermostat set to 22Â°C").
- **Calibration:**  Allow the user to calibrate the system to their hand size and positioning.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for cases of no hand detection or unclear gestures.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Machine Learning Model for Gesture Classification:** Train a simple classifier to improve gesture recognition accuracy beyond basic thresholding.
- **Integration with a real smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant):**  Replace the simulated control with actual interaction with a smart home system.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Hand Tracking:** Install necessary libraries, set up the webcam feed, and implement hand tracking using MediaPipe.
2. **Gesture Definition & Thresholding:** Define the three gestures and develop logic based on hand landmark positions and orientations to classify them.  (Simpler thresholding approach for a 1-2 day challenge).
3. **Smart Home Action Simulation:** Implement the functions simulating interactions with smart home devices based on recognized gestures.
4. **Calibration Routine:** Create a simple calibration step allowing the user to adjust thresholds based on their hand size and positioning.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system and refine the gesture recognition logic and thresholds for optimal accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness to Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can affect the accuracy of hand tracking.  Consider implementing techniques to mitigate this, like background subtraction or image enhancement.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Designing gestures that are easily distinguishable and less prone to misinterpretations is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  Gain hands-on experience with real-time computer vision techniques using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Real-time System Development:**  Develop and test a real-time application with a focus on efficient code and resource management.
