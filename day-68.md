# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize specific hand gestures to trigger pre-defined actions, such as turning lights on/off, adjusting volume, or pausing/playing music. This allows for intuitive and contactless control of smart home devices, offering a novel user interface.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (hand tracking), PyAutoGUI (screen automation), potentially a library for specific smart home integration (e.g., Home Assistant API).
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with sufficient processing power.


## Features & Requirements
- **Hand Detection and Tracking:**  Accurately detect and track the user's hand in real-time using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct micro-gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, thumbs up/down).
- **Action Triggering:**  Map recognized gestures to specific smart home actions (e.g., swipe left = decrease volume, thumbs up = turn on lights).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display a visual cue on the screen indicating the recognized gesture.
- **Calibration:**  Allow for calibration to account for variations in lighting and hand size.

- **Advanced Features:** Gesture customization (users define their own gestures and mappings), multiple user support.
- **Optional Feature:** Integration with a specific smart home platform (e.g., Philips Hue, IFTTT).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI) and test the webcam connection.
2. **Hand Tracking and Gesture Definition:** Implement hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe. Define key points for each gesture and create a simple classification model (e.g., using Euclidean distance between key points).
3. **Action Mapping and Execution:**  Create a mapping between recognized gestures and desired actions.  Use PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard inputs or mouse clicks to control smart home devices (or integrate with a smart home API).
4. **GUI Development (Optional):** Create a basic GUI to display real-time feedback and potentially allow for gesture calibration and customization.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures, lighting conditions, and distances to identify areas for improvement.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robustness to Noise:**  Handling variations in lighting, background clutter, and hand positioning can be challenging.  Exploring advanced image processing techniques might be needed.
- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition requires careful feature selection and potentially more sophisticated machine learning models (beyond simple distance-based classification).  Focus on a small, well-defined set of gestures for a daily challenge.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce practical application of computer vision techniques:** This project provides hands-on experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Develop skills in integrating different libraries:**  The project requires combining several libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI), strengthening skills in software integration and modular design.
