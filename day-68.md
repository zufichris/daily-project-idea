# Smart Home Device Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to create a prototype for a smart home device control system that responds to both voice commands and hand gestures.  This allows for a more intuitive and accessible method of controlling smart home appliances compared to traditional app-based solutions.  The focus will be on a minimal viable product (MVP) demonstrating core functionality.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyAutoGUI (for gesture recognition), SpeechRecognition (for voice recognition), a suitable smart home API library (e.g., Home Assistant API).
- **Hardware:**  A webcam (for gesture recognition).  Optional:  A Raspberry Pi or similar for deployment beyond a development environment.
- **Software:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to basic voice commands like "Turn on the lights," "Set the thermostat to 72 degrees," or "Play music in the living room."
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., a wave for "On/Off," a thumbs up/down for volume control).
- **Device Integration:**  The system should integrate with at least one simulated smart home device (initially, this could be a simple LED simulator represented via a GUI) via a mock API to send control commands.
- **Error Handling:** The system needs to gracefully handle invalid voice commands and gesture recognition failures.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide visual or audio feedback to confirm commands are processed.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Multiple user profile support, customizable gestures.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Integration with a real smart home platform (Home Assistant, etc.).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries (PyAutoGUI, SpeechRecognition, chosen smart home API library), and test each library individually.
2. **Voice Command Processing:** Implement the voice recognition functionality using SpeechRecognition, mapping voice commands to actions.  Handle potential errors in speech recognition.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Implement basic gesture recognition using PyAutoGUI and the webcam.  Focus on a limited set of simple gestures (e.g., wave, thumbs up/down).
4. **Smart Home API Integration:**  Either use a mock API (a simple Python script simulating smart home devices) or connect to a real platform if time permits. Implement logic to send commands based on voice and gesture input.
5. **GUI Integration (Optional):** Create a simple GUI (using Tkinter or similar) to visually represent the simulated smart devices and provide feedback.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:** Hand gesture recognition can be prone to errors due to lighting, background clutter, or inconsistencies in hand positioning. Experiment with different parameters and thresholds to improve accuracy.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Balancing responsiveness with accuracy in both voice and gesture recognition may require optimizing code for speed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Input Processing:** Gain experience in handling and integrating different input modalities (voice and gestures).
- **Real-time System Design:** Practice creating a system that responds to real-time events and user inputs.
