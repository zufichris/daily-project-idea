# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a basic self-balancing control system for a two-wheeled robot using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.  The goal is to implement and tune the PID controller to maintain the robot's upright position, demonstrating a core concept in robotics control systems.  This can be achieved through simulation or with a physical robot if available.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID control implementation), Pygame (for simulation visualization - optional, can be replaced with other visualization tools or omitted for direct hardware control).
* **Hardware (Optional):** Arduino/Raspberry Pi (with appropriate motor drivers and IMU sensor - e.g., MPU6050), two DC motors, battery.  Simulation avoids this need.


## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Control:** The robot should maintain its upright position against small disturbances.
- **PID Controller Implementation:** A functional PID controller should be implemented to adjust motor speeds based on the robot's angle and angular velocity.
- **Sensor Integration (if using hardware):**  Accurate reading and interpretation of IMU sensor data (angle and angular velocity).
- **Motor Control (if using hardware):**  Precise control of the two DC motors to achieve balance.
- **Data Logging (Optional):** Record sensor data and controller output for analysis.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Setup:**  If using simulation, create a simple 2D model of the robot in Pygame or a similar environment. Define the robot's physical parameters (mass, wheel radius, etc.). If using hardware, connect and test the IMU and motor drivers.
2. **Sensor Reading (Hardware Only):** Implement code to read angle and angular velocity data from the IMU.  For simulation, generate these values based on the simulated robot's state.
3. **PID Controller Implementation:** Implement the PID algorithm in Python using NumPy and SciPy. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) initially with reasonable values.
4. **Motor Control (Hardware Only):** Implement the code to control motor speeds based on the PID controller output. For simulation, update the robot's state (angle and angular velocity) based on the PID output.
5. **Testing and Tuning:**  Test the system, observe the robot's response, and iteratively tune the PID gains to achieve optimal stability.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and requires iterative testing and adjustment.  Using a systematic approach, such as Ziegler-Nichols method, is highly recommended.
- **Sensor Noise (Hardware Only):**  IMU readings may be noisy. Implementing a simple filter (e.g., moving average) can help mitigate this.  Simulation avoids this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control concepts:**  Gain a deeper understanding of how PID controllers work and their application in robotics.
- **Practical experience in sensor integration and motor control:**  If using hardware, you'll gain hands-on experience in working with sensors, actuators, and embedded systems.  Simulation provides valuable practice in controller design.
