# Mini-Game AI: Reinforcement Learning for a Simple 2D Environment

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple 2D game environment and training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to master it within a short timeframe.  The game's simplicity allows for rapid prototyping and iteration, focusing on core RL concepts rather than complex game mechanics. The significance lies in understanding the practical application of RL and building an intuitive understanding of its training process.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 or similar (e.g., RLlib)
* **Game Engine (Optional):** Pygame (for visualization, not strictly required for core RL)
* **IDE:**  VS Code or PyCharm

## Features & Requirements

- **Simple 2D Environment:** A small grid-based environment (e.g., 10x10) with a defined start, goal, and obstacles.
- **Reward System:** A clear reward structure for reaching the goal and penalties for hitting obstacles or taking too many steps.
- **RL Agent Training:** Implementation of a basic RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).
- **Agent Visualization (Optional):** Visual representation of the agent's movement and progress within the environment using Pygame.
- **Performance Metrics:** Tracking of the agent's performance (e.g., average steps to goal, success rate).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Incorporating a dynamic environment (moving obstacles).
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Using a more sophisticated RL algorithm (e.g., A2C, DDPG)


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Define the game environment using a simple data structure (e.g., NumPy array).  Define the reward function.
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an RL algorithm (PPO recommended for its relative simplicity and effectiveness) from a library like Stable Baselines3.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement the training loop, iteratively running the agent within the environment, collecting data, and updating the agent's policy.
4. **Visualization (Optional):** If using Pygame, create a simple visual representation of the environment and the agent's progress.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the agent's performance using defined metrics.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm might require experimentation.  Start with default values and adjust iteratively.
- **Reward Shaping:**  Designing an effective reward function that guides the agent towards the desired behavior is crucial.  Poor reward shaping can lead to unexpected agent behavior.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience with applying RL concepts (rewards, policies, value functions) in a tangible project.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:** Learn to utilize existing RL libraries to accelerate the development process and focus on the algorithm design and application rather than implementation from scratch.
