# Mini-Game AI Agent with Self-Play Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple AI agent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, employing a self-play reinforcement learning approach. The goal is to create an agent that can learn optimal strategies within a short timeframe through repeated self-play and minimal human intervention. This demonstrates a foundational concept in AI and game theory.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

## Features & Requirements
- **Core Features:**
    - Game engine for Tic-Tac-Toe (or Connect Four).
    - AI agent using a simple neural network (e.g., a small feedforward network).
    - Self-play learning loop: the agent plays against itself, updating its strategy based on wins/losses.
    - Evaluation metric: win rate against a random player.
    - Basic visualization of the game state and agent's moves.
- **Advanced/Optional Features:**
    -  Incorporating exploration vs. exploitation techniques (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
    -  Saving and loading trained models.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Engine:** Create a basic game engine for Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, including functions for making moves, checking for wins, and determining valid moves.
2. **Agent Architecture:** Design a simple neural network to represent the agent's strategy. The input would be the game board state, and the output would be probabilities for each possible move.
3. **Self-Play Loop:** Implement a loop where the agent plays against itself multiple times. After each game, update the agent's network weights using a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a simple gradient update based on the outcome).
4. **Evaluation:** Periodically evaluate the agent's performance by playing it against a random player (or a simpler, pre-defined agent).
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Add basic visualization to display the game state and the agent's learning progress.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:**  The number of self-play iterations might need to be limited to fit within the time constraint.  Experiment with network size and training parameters to balance performance and speed.
- **Overfitting:** A small network might overfit to its own strategy. Consider techniques like data augmentation (e.g., randomizing starting player).


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradients).
- Practical experience in building and training simple neural networks.
- Understanding the trade-offs between model complexity, training time, and performance.
