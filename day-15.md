#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a rudimentary obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using reinforcement learning.  The goal is to train a simple agent to navigate a simulated environment, avoiding obstacles, using a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm. This project is scoped to a simplified environment and aims for a proof-of-concept within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or a similar lightweight library)
* **Simulation Environment:** Pygame (for simplicity and rapid prototyping) or a small subset of a more complex simulator like AirSim (if time permits).
* **Drone Simulation:**  A basic 2D drone model with limited movement capabilities (up/down, left/right, forward/backward).


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Detection:**  The drone should detect obstacles (represented as simple shapes in the simulation) within its proximity.
- **Movement Control:** The drone should be able to move in response to obstacle detection.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** A simple RL agent (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) will learn to navigate the environment and avoid obstacles.
- **Reward System:** Define a reward function that incentivizes the drone to move forward while avoiding collisions.
- **Training and Evaluation:**  The agent should be trained and its performance evaluated in the simulated environment.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **More complex environment:** Adding varying obstacle sizes and types.
- **Real-time visualization:**  Displaying the drone's movement and training progress visually within the Pygame window.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple Pygame window with a 2D drone sprite and randomly placed obstacle sprites. Define the drone's movement dynamics and collision detection logic.
2. **Agent Implementation:**  Implement a simple RL agent using Stable Baselines3 (or similar). Choose a suitable algorithm like PPO for its relative ease of use and effectiveness.
3. **Reward Function Design:**  Create a reward function that rewards forward progress and penalizes collisions. Experiment with different reward schemes to find what works best.
4. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that iteratively runs the simulation, collects data, and updates the RL agent's policy.
5. **Evaluation:**  After training, evaluate the agent's performance in a separate test environment with unseen obstacle arrangements.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Tuning:** Finding the optimal reward function can be challenging and requires experimentation.  Start with a simple reward function and iterate.
- **Simulation Complexity vs. Time Constraints:**  Balancing the complexity of the simulation environment with the time constraints of a daily challenge is crucial. Focus on a minimal viable environment first.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience in implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.
- **Simulation-Based Development:** Develop skills in designing and using a simplified simulation environment for testing and prototyping.
