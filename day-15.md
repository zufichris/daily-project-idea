# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet powerful system for real-time object detection and tracking using a web browser and WebRTC.  The system will detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in a live video stream from a webcam, track its movement, and display the results overlaid on the video feed. This demonstrates practical applications in areas like augmented reality, robotics control, and remote monitoring.  The focus is on efficient implementation and streamlined visualization within the constraints of a short development timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with TypeScript preferred)
* **Framework:** React (or similar JavaScript framework for UI)
* **Libraries:**
    * TensorFlow.js (for object detection)
    * WebRTC (for real-time video streaming)
    * OpenCV.js (optional, for advanced image processing)
* **Tools:**  VS Code (or preferred IDE), Node.js, npm or yarn.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:**  Acquire video feed from user's webcam using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Utilize a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model (e.g., MobileNet SSD) to detect a predefined object in the video stream.
- **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking) to follow the detected object across frames.
- **Visual Feedback:** Overlay bounding boxes and potentially trajectories on the live video feed, indicating the detected and tracked object's location.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Display basic performance metrics (e.g., frames per second, detection latency).

- **Advanced Features:**  Integration with a mobile app via WebRTC for remote object monitoring.  Implementation of a more sophisticated tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) for smoother tracking.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary Node packages and configure the project structure.
2. **Implement WebRTC video capture:** Integrate WebRTC to capture the webcam feed and display it in the browser.
3. **Integrate object detection:** Load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model and apply it to each frame of the video stream.
4. **Implement object tracking:**  Track the detected object's position across frames using a suitable algorithm.
5. **Visualize results:** Overlay bounding boxes and tracking information onto the video feed.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance optimization:**  Balancing accuracy and speed of object detection and tracking within the browser's limitations might require model selection and optimization strategies.
- **Robustness of tracking:** Handling occlusions or sudden changes in lighting conditions can affect tracking accuracy.  Consider using more advanced tracking techniques to address this.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project reinforces skills in real-time video processing using WebRTC and JavaScript.
- The experience gained will enhance understanding of object detection and tracking algorithms and their practical implementation using machine learning libraries in the browser.
