# Optimized Pathfinding for a Simulated Mobile Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a pathfinding algorithm for a simulated mobile robot navigating a dynamic environment. The goal is to create a system that can efficiently find the shortest path while avoiding obstacles, demonstrating proficiency in algorithm design and implementation.  This will be done within the confines of a simulated environment to allow for rapid testing and iteration.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization and simulation), NetworkX (optional, for graph representation and shortest path algorithms)
* **Algorithm:** A* Search (with potential for optimization using heuristics like Euclidean distance)


## Features & Requirements

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot should successfully navigate around static and dynamic obstacles in the simulated environment.
- **Pathfinding:** The robot should find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal point.
- **Visualization:**  The pathfinding process should be visually represented in the Pygame window, showing the robot's movement and the calculated path.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:** The robot should react to new obstacles appearing in its path during execution (e.g., moving obstacles).
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a path smoothing algorithm to reduce sharp turns and improve robot maneuverability.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a Pygame window displaying a simple grid-based environment with randomly placed static obstacles.  Define the start and goal positions.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* search algorithm to find a path from start to goal, avoiding obstacles.  Use a suitable heuristic (e.g., Euclidean distance).
3. **Robot Simulation:**  Simulate the robot moving along the calculated path, visually updating its position in the Pygame window.
4. **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:** Introduce dynamic obstacles (e.g., moving squares) and adapt the pathfinding algorithm to recalculate the path in real-time if necessary (re-planning).
5. **Visualization Enhancement (Optional):** Add visual cues to highlight the explored nodes, the final path, and the dynamic obstacles.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Efficiency:**  For larger environments or complex obstacle layouts, the A* algorithm might become computationally expensive.  Consider optimizing the algorithm or using more efficient data structures.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Collision Detection:**  Accurately detecting and reacting to moving obstacles in real-time requires careful consideration of timing and collision detection techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of pathfinding algorithms:** This project will solidify understanding of A* search and its implementation.
- **Develop proficiency in algorithm optimization:**  Addressing computational efficiency will encourage exploring optimization strategies and data structure choices.
