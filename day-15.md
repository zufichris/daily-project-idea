# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition. The significance lies in exploring a more intuitive and contactless human-computer interaction method for smart home devices, moving beyond traditional voice or app-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  a suitable library for controlling the target smart appliance (e.g., if using a Philips Hue bulb, the `phue` library)
- **Hardware:** A webcam (or built-in laptop camera), a target smart home appliance with API access.
- **IDE:**  PyCharm or VS Code.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:** The system should accurately detect and classify predefined hand gestures (e.g., open hand for ON, closed fist for OFF, thumbs up for brightness up).
- **Appliance Control:**  The recognized gestures should directly trigger corresponding actions on the chosen smart appliance (e.g., turning ON/OFF, adjusting brightness/fan speed).
- **Gesture Calibration:**  Allow users to calibrate the system to their specific hand size and gestures.
- **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle situations where gestures are not recognized or are ambiguous.
- **GUI (Optional):**  A simple GUI could be implemented to display the detected gesture and the current state of the appliance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, and the relevant library for your chosen smart appliance).
2. **Implement hand tracking:** Use MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
3. **Gesture recognition:** Develop a simple gesture classification logic based on the detected landmarks (e.g., using distance thresholds or angles between landmarks).
4. **Integrate with smart appliance:**  Connect to the chosen smart appliance's API and send control commands based on the recognized gestures.
5. **(Optional) Develop a basic GUI:** Create a simple user interface to display the system's status and detected gestures.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of gesture recognition:**  Dealing with variations in lighting, hand positioning, and background clutter can be challenging.  Consider using techniques like background subtraction and hand segmentation to improve robustness.
- **Latency:**  Minimizing the delay between gesture detection and appliance control is crucial for a smooth user experience.  Efficient code optimization and selecting appropriate libraries are important.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce Computer Vision Skills:** Develop and apply practical skills in real-time computer vision, image processing, and gesture recognition.
- **Practice API Integration:** Gain experience integrating software with external hardware or services (e.g., a smart home device API).
