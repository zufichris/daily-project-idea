# Self-Balancing Robot Control with PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to stabilize a simulated inverted pendulum (a simplified self-balancing robot model). The goal is to design and implement a PID controller to keep the pendulum upright, emphasizing the practical application of control theory concepts within a limited timeframe.  The projectâ€™s significance lies in understanding the fundamental principles of PID control, crucial for various robotics and automation applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for numerical computation and control systems), Matplotlib (for visualization)
* **Simulation Environment:**  A simple physics simulation can be built from scratch or utilized using a lightweight physics engine like Pymunk.

## Features & Requirements

- **Pendulum Simulation:** A simulated inverted pendulum with gravity and friction.
- **PID Controller Implementation:**  A functioning PID controller to maintain the pendulum's upright position.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Visual feedback showing the pendulum's angle and controller output.
- **Tunable PID Gains:**  Allow for manual adjustment of the P, I, and D gains to optimize performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Basic metrics like settling time and overshoot should be recorded.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement an automatic gain tuning algorithm (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols method) for improved efficiency.
- **Optional Feature:** Add noise to the sensor readings to simulate real-world imperfections.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Simulation Setup:** Create a simple physics simulation of the inverted pendulum.  This could involve basic equations of motion implemented in Python.
2. **PID Controller Design:** Implement the PID control algorithm.  This involves defining the proportional, integral, and derivative terms and calculating the control signal based on the pendulum's angle and angular velocity.
3. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the PID controller with the simulation. Test the system with various initial conditions and manually tune the PID gains to achieve stability.
4. **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib to create plots showing the pendulum's angle over time and the controller output.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Record and analyze key performance indicators like settling time and overshoot.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Start with reasonable initial values and systematically adjust them.
- **Simulation Accuracy:**  A simplified simulation might not perfectly reflect real-world dynamics.  Focus on capturing the essential aspects of the inverted pendulum for a basic demonstration.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of PID control theory:** The project provides hands-on experience with designing, implementing, and tuning a PID controller.
- **Understanding of control systems:**  This project helps understand the importance of feedback control in maintaining stability and achieving desired performance in dynamic systems.
