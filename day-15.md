# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet effective system for real-time object detection and tracking using a web camera, leveraging the power of WebRTC for seamless browser-based streaming and communication. This will demonstrate a practical application of computer vision and real-time communication technologies.  The significance lies in its potential for various applications such as remote monitoring, augmented reality experiences, and interactive interfaces.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js for backend if needed)
* **Frontend Framework:** React or similar (optional, but simplifies development)
* **Object Detection Library:** TensorFlow.js or similar (pre-trained model)
* **WebRTC Library:** Simple-peer.js or similar
* **Backend (Optional):** Node.js with Express.js (for handling multiple clients)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  The system should accurately detect a predefined object (e.g., a person, a specific colored object) from the web camera feed using a pre-trained model.
- **Object Tracking:** Once detected, the system should track the object's movement within the camera's field of view.
- **WebRTC Streaming:** The detected object's location and bounding box should be streamed in real-time to a remote client via WebRTC.
- **Visual Feedback:**  A simple visualization (e.g., bounding box around the object) should be displayed on both the client and server sides.
- **Client-side Processing:**  Minimize server-side processing to emphasize browser capabilities.


- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement object classification beyond detection (e.g., identifying the type of object).
- **Advanced Features (Optional):** Add a simple user interface for selecting the object to track.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Set up the development environment, install necessary libraries, and choose a pre-trained object detection model compatible with TensorFlow.js.
2. **Object Detection Integration:** Integrate the chosen object detection model into the frontend, ensuring it processes the webcam feed effectively.
3. **WebRTC Implementation:** Implement WebRTC using a library like Simple-peer.js to establish a peer-to-peer connection between the client (webcam) and a server (optional). Transmit the object's location data over the connection.
4. **Visualisation:** Develop a simple display to show the detected and tracked object, including bounding boxes and potentially other relevant information.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system, focusing on accuracy, latency, and robustness.  Adjust parameters and optimize the code for improved performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:** Real-time processing of video can be computationally intensive. Optimizing the object detection model and minimizing latency are crucial.  Consider using techniques like model quantization.
- **Network Conditions:** WebRTC performance is sensitive to network conditions. Testing under various network scenarios is necessary to ensure robustness.  Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## Learning Outcomes

- This project will reinforce practical skills in real-time video processing, object detection using deep learning models, and WebRTC for real-time communication.
- It will provide hands-on experience in integrating different technologies to build a complex, yet functional system within a limited timeframe.
