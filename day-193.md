# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV.  The system will identify and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within a live video feed from a webcam. This project demonstrates core computer vision concepts and efficient implementation within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam or video file, a suitable IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Capture video frames from a webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within each frame using color thresholding.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object across consecutive frames using a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., centroid tracking).
- **Bounding Box Display:**  Draw a bounding box around the tracked object in real-time.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames-per-second (FPS) to measure performance.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implement a more robust tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter) for improved accuracy.
- **Advanced Feature:** Incorporate a simple machine learning model for object classification beyond color thresholding.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) and set up your development environment.
2. **Video Capture & Preprocessing:**  Write code to capture frames from the webcam and convert them to the HSV color space for easier color thresholding.
3. **Object Detection:** Implement color thresholding to isolate the object of interest (e.g., red ball) based on its HSV values.  Find contours to locate the object's boundaries.
4. **Object Tracking:** Use centroid tracking to follow the object's movement across frames.  Calculate the centroid (center) of the detected object in each frame.
5. **Display & Performance:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object and display the FPS on the video feed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly affect color thresholding accuracy. Experiment with different HSV ranges and potentially incorporate adaptive thresholding.
- **Object Occlusion:** If the object is temporarily occluded, the tracking algorithm might lose it.  Consider implementing a more robust tracking method (like Kalman filter) to address this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of OpenCV:**  This project provides hands-on experience with OpenCV's video processing, color thresholding, and contour detection functionalities.
- **Practical application of computer vision algorithms:**  The project demonstrates the implementation of a fundamental object tracking algorithm and highlights its limitations and potential improvements.
