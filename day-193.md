# Mini-Max Search for a Simple Game AI

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Mini-Max search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to create a simple AI opponent for a tic-tac-toe game.  The goal is to build a functional AI that can play optimally against a human player within a day or two, showcasing a core concept in game AI development. The project's significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental search algorithm used extensively in game playing and decision-making systems.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  `pygame` (for GUI, optional, can be replaced with a simpler text-based interface), `numpy` (optional, for potential board representation optimization)


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Board Representation:** A data structure (list or numpy array) representing the tic-tac-toe board.
- **Mini-Max Algorithm Implementation:**  A recursive function implementing the Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient search.
- **AI Player Movement:** The AI should choose the best move based on the Mini-Max search results.
- **Human Player Input:** Allow a human player to interact with the game, making moves on the board.
- **Game Win/Draw Detection:**  Correctly identify win and draw conditions.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Implement a difficulty setting that adjusts the search depth of the Mini-Max algorithm.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using `pygame` for a more engaging experience.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Board Representation & Game Logic:** Create a data structure to represent the tic-tac-toe board and implement functions to check for win/draw conditions and make moves.
2. **Mini-Max Algorithm:** Implement the recursive Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This is the core part of the project and might require careful attention to the recursive calls and pruning logic.
3. **AI Player Logic:** Integrate the Mini-Max algorithm to make the AI choose its moves.
4. **Human Player Input:**  Add functionality for human players to input their moves (e.g., via console input or GUI).
5. **Game Loop:** Create a main game loop that alternates between human and AI turns until the game ends.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Recursive Depth:**  Balancing the depth of the Mini-Max search with computational cost. Too deep might be slow, while too shallow might lead to suboptimal AI play.  Consider using iterative deepening to mitigate this.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning Implementation:** Correctly implementing alpha-beta pruning is crucial for performance.  A small bug can significantly impact the search efficiency.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of search algorithms:**  This project strengthens understanding of Mini-Max and alpha-beta pruning, crucial concepts in AI and game development.
- **Practical application of recursion:**  Implementing the recursive Mini-Max algorithm provides hands-on experience with recursion and its efficient use.
