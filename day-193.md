# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple yet functional real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The goal is to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and track its movement within the camera's field of view, displaying the tracked object's coordinates on the screen. This demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts in a tangible and immediately rewarding way.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model with sufficient processing power), USB camera.
* **Software:** Python 3, OpenCV (cv2), NumPy.

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera's feed using color thresholding.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's centroid across consecutive frames.
- **Coordinate Display:** Display the (x, y) coordinates of the object's centroid on the screen in real-time.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.
- **Bounding Box (Optional):** Draw a bounding box around the detected object.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a simple Kalman filter for smoother object tracking.
- **Advanced Feature:** Allow for selecting the target object color via a GUI.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Set up the Raspberry Pi, install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`), and connect the camera.
2. **Color Thresholding:** Write a function to isolate the object's color using OpenCV's color space conversion (e.g., HSV) and thresholding techniques.  This will create a binary mask showing only the object.
3. **Centroid Calculation:** Calculate the centroid (center of mass) of the detected object from the binary mask.
4. **Tracking & Display:** Implement a loop to continuously capture frames, perform object detection, calculate the centroid, and display the coordinates and FPS on the screen using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **(Optional) Kalman Filter Implementation:** Integrate a Kalman filter to predict the object's position and smooth out noisy tracking results.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect color thresholding accuracy. Experiment with different color spaces and thresholding values to find optimal parameters.
- **Object Occlusion:** If the target object is partially or completely obscured, the tracking might fail.  More robust tracking algorithms (e.g., using object features beyond color) might be needed for more advanced applications.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforces practical application of computer vision techniques like color thresholding, contour detection, and centroid calculation.
- Develops skills in real-time image processing and handling video streams with OpenCV.
