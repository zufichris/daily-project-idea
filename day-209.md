# Minimalist Robotic Arm Trajectory Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simplified trajectory optimization algorithm for a robotic arm with 2-3 degrees of freedom (DOF). The goal is to generate smooth and collision-free trajectories for reaching a target position while minimizing joint movement. This is a simplified version of a complex problem, making it suitable for a 1-2 day challenge.  The focus will be on achieving a functional prototype, not a fully optimized solution.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy (for optimization), Matplotlib (for visualization)
- **Robotics Simulation (Optional but Recommended):** PyBullet or V-REP (for testing the trajectory in a simulated environment)

## Features & Requirements

- **Target Point Input:** The user specifies the desired end-effector (gripper) position (x, y, z coordinates).
- **Trajectory Generation:** The algorithm generates a smooth trajectory from the arm's initial position to the target position, considering joint limits.
- **Collision Avoidance (Simplified):**  The algorithm avoids self-collision (for arms with multiple links) by enforcing joint limits, or by using a very simple distance-based collision detection.
- **Trajectory Visualization:** The generated trajectory is visualized using Matplotlib.
- **Basic Performance Metrics:**  The algorithm calculates the total joint movement (a simple performance metric).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Incorporate a basic obstacle avoidance mechanism using simple geometric shapes.
- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement a more sophisticated optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent) to improve trajectory smoothness.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and choose a simulation environment (optional).
2. **Forward Kinematics:**  Implement the forward kinematics equations for the robotic arm (relating joint angles to end-effector position).
3. **Trajectory Optimization (Simplified):**  Use a simple optimization technique (e.g., linear interpolation) to generate an initial trajectory.  This can be significantly improved upon in a second day by implementing more sophisticated methods.
4. **Collision Detection (Simplified):** Implement basic collision detection by checking if any joint angles violate pre-defined limits.
5. **Visualization and Testing:** Visualize the generated trajectory using Matplotlib (and in the simulator if chosen).  Test the algorithm with different target positions.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Optimization Algorithm Selection:** Choosing an appropriate optimization algorithm for the limited time frame.  A simple approach is sufficient for a daily challenge.
- **Handling Singularities:**  Robotic arms can have singular configurations where the solution for inverse kinematics is not unique. Handling this robustly is beyond the scope of a daily challenge.  The simplified collision detection can mitigate this issue somewhat.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of kinematics and trajectory planning concepts.**
- **Practical experience in using optimization algorithms and libraries in Python.**
