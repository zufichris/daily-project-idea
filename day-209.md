# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will interpret simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up/down, wave, point) to control specific smart home devices or functionalities.  This offers a hands-free and intuitive alternative to traditional voice or app-based controls.  The focus will be on a minimal viable product (MVP) with a single gesture for a single device.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for pose estimation),  SimpleHTTPServer (for basic webserver if needed for remote control).
* **Hardware:** Webcam (any standard USB webcam will suffice)
* **Optional:** A smart home device (e.g., smart light bulb) for integration testing.

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Webcam Feed Processing:** The system must capture and process the webcam feed in real-time.
- **Hand Gesture Detection:**  Accurately detect a pre-defined hand gesture (e.g., thumbs up for light on, thumbs down for light off).
- **Device Control:** Trigger a specific action on a connected smart home device based on the detected gesture (light on/off in the MVP).
- **User Interface (UI):** A basic visual interface to display the detected gesture and device status (optional, can be a simple command-line output for the MVP).
- **Error Handling:**  Gracefully handle situations where a gesture isn't recognized or the device is unavailable.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Multiple gesture recognition (e.g., wave to adjust brightness),  calibration for different lighting conditions.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe).
2. **Gesture Recognition Module:** Implement a function using MediaPipe to detect and classify the chosen hand gesture from the webcam feed.
3. **Device Control Integration:** Integrate a simple device control mechanism (e.g., sending an HTTP request to a smart bulb API, or using a local control mechanism if a physical device is directly accessible).
4. **Real-time Processing Loop:** Combine the gesture recognition and device control in a loop to process the webcam feed continuously.
5. **UI Development (Optional):** Create a basic UI to display the webcam feed, recognized gesture, and device status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness:**  Achieving accurate gesture recognition across varying lighting conditions and hand positions can be challenging.  Consider using image preprocessing techniques to improve robustness.
- **Real-time Performance:** Processing the webcam feed in real-time requires efficient code and potentially optimized algorithms.  Focus on minimizing latency.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:** Practical experience with image processing, feature extraction, and classification using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Develop skills in real-time system design:**  Understanding challenges and techniques for building applications that need to process data continuously with minimal delay.
