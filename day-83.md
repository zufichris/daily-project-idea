# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview
This project aims to build a prototype for a smart home control system utilizing a lightweight, real-time micro-gesture recognition system based on a webcam feed.  The goal is to enable users to control smart home devices with subtle hand gestures, eliminating the need for voice commands or physical interfaces in certain contexts. This could be a stepping stone towards more intuitive and accessible smart home technology.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), TensorFlow Lite (optional, for more advanced gesture classification)
- **Tools:** A webcam, a Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurately track hand landmarks from a webcam feed using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize a pre-defined set of simple gestures (e.g., thumbs up/down for lights on/off, a fist for pausing music).
- **Device Control:**  Interface with a simulated smart home environment (e.g., using a simple API or a mock API) to trigger actions based on recognized gestures.
- **User Interface (UI):**  A simple visual representation of recognized gestures and corresponding device states.
- **Calibration:**  An optional calibration step allowing users to fine-tune gesture recognition sensitivity.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Hand Tracking:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and implement real-time hand landmark detection using MediaPipe.
2. **Gesture Definition & Recognition:** Define a small set of simple gestures and develop a logic to classify the tracked hand landmarks into these predefined gestures. This could involve simple distance or angle calculations.
3. **Device Control Integration:**  Connect the gesture recognition system to a simulated smart home API to execute actions based on detected gestures.  For simplicity, this could initially involve printing commands to the console.
4. **UI Development:** Create a basic UI (e.g., using Matplotlib or a simple GUI library) to display the video feed, recognized gestures, and smart home device status.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various hand gestures and lighting conditions, and refine the gesture recognition logic based on the results.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Achieving reliable gesture recognition in varying lighting conditions and with different hand sizes can be challenging.  Experimentation with different image processing techniques may be necessary.
- **Real-time Performance:**  Balancing accuracy and real-time performance is crucial. Optimizing the code for speed might be required.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Real-time computer vision:**  Gain practical experience in utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and hand tracking.
- **Gesture recognition techniques:** Learn to design and implement a simple gesture recognition algorithm using basic image processing and machine learning concepts.
