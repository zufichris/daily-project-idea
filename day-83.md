# Smart Home Energy Optimization Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic prototype of a smart home energy optimization system that learns user energy consumption patterns and suggests efficient usage strategies.  The focus will be on a simplified model, prioritizing a functional prototype over comprehensive feature implementation within the daily timeframe. The significance lies in exploring reinforcement learning techniques for real-world applications and demonstrating the feasibility of personalized energy management.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn (for potential reinforcement learning model),  matplotlib (for visualization).
* **Data Source:** Simulated energy usage data (can be replaced with real data if available through a smart meter API).
* **Hardware (Optional):**  Raspberry Pi (for simulated smart meter interaction).


## Features & Requirements

- **Data Acquisition:**  Simulate or acquire energy consumption data for various appliances (e.g., lights, AC, washing machine) over time.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring usage patterns and peak consumption times.
- **Optimization Suggestions:** Based on identified patterns, generate simple recommendations for energy savings (e.g., "Reduce AC usage during peak hours").
- **Data Visualization:** Display energy consumption patterns and optimization suggestions visually using graphs.
- **Basic Reporting:** Provide a summary of daily/weekly energy usage and potential savings.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a rudimentary reinforcement learning agent to dynamically adjust optimization suggestions based on user feedback.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integrate with a real smart meter API for live data acquisition.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Generate or acquire sample energy consumption data.  Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
2. **Pattern Analysis:** Use statistical methods (e.g., moving averages, clustering) to identify recurring consumption patterns and peak hours.
3. **Optimization Algorithm:** Develop a simple algorithm that generates energy saving suggestions based on the identified patterns. This could be rule-based or a very simple machine learning model.
4. **Visualization & Reporting:** Create visual representations of energy usage data and the optimization suggestions.  Implement basic reporting functionality.
5. **Prototype Testing:** Test the prototype with simulated data and evaluate its effectiveness in suggesting energy-saving strategies.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:** Simulated data may not accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.  Handling noisy or incomplete real-world data requires robust preprocessing techniques.
- **Algorithm Complexity:**  Developing a sophisticated reinforcement learning agent within the daily timeframe is unrealistic. Focusing on a simple rule-based or basic machine learning model is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Data Analysis Techniques:**  Reinforce skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and pattern recognition using statistical and machine learning methods.
- **Algorithm Design:**  Practice designing and implementing algorithms for data analysis and optimization within a constrained timeframe.
