# Smart Home Device Energy Monitoring & Optimization

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype system that monitors energy consumption of smart home devices and provides optimization recommendations based on usage patterns.  The goal is to create a small-scale, functional prototype that demonstrates the core principles of real-time data collection, analysis, and automated suggestions within a limited time frame. This is relevant due to the growing importance of energy efficiency and smart home automation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework/Library:**  Flask (for a simple web interface), Pandas/NumPy (for data analysis), and a suitable library for interacting with your chosen smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant API).
- **Hardware (Optional):**  A Raspberry Pi (or similar) to act as a central data hub, potentially with sensors for additional data.
- **Tools:** A suitable IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), Git for version control.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Data Acquisition:** Collect power consumption data from at least one smart home device (e.g., a smart lamp or smart plug).  The data should be updated at intervals (e.g., every minute).
- **Data Visualization:** Display energy consumption in a simple web interface (e.g., using a chart) showing usage over time.
- **Usage Analysis:** Calculate daily/weekly average energy usage and identify peak consumption times.
- **Basic Optimization Suggestions:** Provide simple recommendations based on usage, such as suggesting turning off devices during periods of inactivity.
- **Data Logging:** Store collected data for later analysis and potentially more advanced modeling.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):** Implement machine learning for predictive energy usage forecasting.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):** Integrate with multiple smart home devices and platforms.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition Setup:**  Choose a smart home device and establish a method to retrieve its power consumption data. This may involve using the device's API or employing a smart plug with its own API.
2. **Data Processing & Visualization:** Process the acquired data using Pandas/NumPy, performing calculations (averages, peak times) and creating visualizations in the chosen web framework.
3. **Optimization Logic Implementation:**  Implement rules-based or simple machine learning algorithms (if going beyond the basic features) to suggest energy-saving measures.
4. **Web Interface Development:** Create a basic web interface (using Flask or a similar framework) to display the data, visualizations, and optimization recommendations.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system, refining the data processing, visualizations, and recommendations based on testing results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **API Integration:**  Accessing and reliably collecting data from different smart home devices' APIs may involve varying complexities and authentication protocols.
- **Data Accuracy and Reliability:**  The accuracy of collected power consumption data can depend on the reliability of the smart home device and its API.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-world application of data analysis and visualization techniques.**
- **Experience in integrating with external APIs and building a simple web application.**
