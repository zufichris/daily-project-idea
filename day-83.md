# Smart Home Device Control via Hand Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to create a prototype of a smart home device control system using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will allow users to control basic smart home functions (e.g., lighting, music) through predefined hand gestures, eliminating the need for a physical remote or voice commands.  This project focuses on a simplified, robust implementation suitable for a short development timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for hand tracking),  Pygame (optional, for visual feedback)
* **Hardware:** Webcam (any standard USB webcam will suffice)
* **Optional:**  A Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer for deployment beyond a desktop environment.  A smart home device API (e.g., Home Assistant API).

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:**  The system should accurately identify pre-defined gestures (e.g., open hand for lights on, closed fist for lights off, thumbs up for volume increase).
- **Smart Home Integration (Basic):**  Control at least one simulated smart home device (e.g., a simple on/off switch for a "light").  
- **User Interface (Basic):** A visual representation of the recognized gestures or the current state of the simulated device.
- **Robustness:** The system should be relatively insensitive to minor variations in hand position and lighting conditions.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of unrecognized gestures and potential errors in the process.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Device Control:** Extend control to multiple simulated devices (e.g., lights, music player).
- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Integrate a custom-trained model for improved gesture recognition accuracy.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, Pygame).
2. **Hand Gesture Detection:** Implement real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe's hand detection model.  Focus on extracting relevant features (e.g., hand landmarks).
3. **Gesture Recognition:**  Develop a simple logic to map detected hand landmarks to predefined gestures. Consider using basic geometric calculations or simple thresholds for gesture classification.
4. **Smart Home Simulation:** Create a basic simulation to represent the smart home device(s) and update its state based on recognized gestures.
5. **User Interface (Optional):**  Implement a visual interface using Pygame to show recognized gestures and device status.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Variations in hand size, lighting, and background can affect accuracy. Experiment with different hand tracking models and parameters to find a balance between accuracy and speed.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Ensuring that gesture recognition and device control happen smoothly in real-time requires optimized code and efficient algorithms. Consider simplifying gesture models if needed.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Hands-on experience with computer vision:**  This project reinforces skills in image processing, object detection, and feature extraction.
- **Real-time application development:**  The project teaches how to build a responsive system that processes data and responds in real time.
