# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision.  The goal is to accurately determine the end-effector's position and orientation in 3D space relative to a known reference point, using only a camera and pre-defined calibration targets.  This is crucial for precise robotic manipulation tasks and can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of automated systems.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, PyBullet for simulation)
- **Tools:**  A calibrated camera (or simulated camera), a robotic arm (physical or simulated), a chessboard or similar calibration target.

## Features & Requirements
- **Target Detection:** Detect and locate the calibration target (chessboard) in the camera image using OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners`.
- **Camera Calibration:** Perform camera calibration using OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` to obtain intrinsic camera parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients).
- **Pose Estimation:** Estimate the pose (position and orientation) of the calibration target relative to the camera.
- **Arm Position Mapping:**  Relate the camera-based target pose to the robotic arm's joint angles (requires arm kinematics, potentially simplified for a day's work).
- **Verification:**  Move the arm to a calculated position and verify its accuracy through image analysis.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement a robust error handling mechanism to account for detection failures.
- **Advanced Features:** Incorporate iterative refinement techniques to improve calibration accuracy.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Target Detection:** Set up the camera and robotic arm. Capture images of the calibration target at different arm positions. Detect the chessboard corners using OpenCV.
2. **Camera Calibration:** Use the detected corner points to calibrate the camera using OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function. Save the intrinsic parameters.
3. **Pose Estimation:** For each image, estimate the pose of the chessboard using `solvePnP` function.
4. **Arm Position Mapping:**  Establish a relationship between the chessboard pose and the corresponding robotic arm joint angles (potentially a simplified linear mapping for the scope of a daily challenge).
5. **Verification and Refinement:**  Command the arm to move to calculated positions based on new target locations and verify accuracy through image analysis. Iteratively refine the mapping if necessary.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Pose Estimation:**  Accurate pose estimation is crucial.  Noise in the image and imperfections in the calibration target can affect results. Robust methods for outlier rejection may be necessary.
- **Robotic Arm Kinematics:** Handling the inverse kinematics (calculating joint angles from desired end-effector pose) can be complex depending on the robotic arm's configuration.  Simplifications or approximations might be needed for a short-term project.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:** Gain hands-on experience with camera calibration, feature detection, and pose estimation techniques.
- **Robotics Integration:** Learn how to integrate computer vision with robotic arm control for precise manipulation tasks.
