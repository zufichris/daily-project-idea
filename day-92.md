# Smart Home Energy Optimizer Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic prototype of a smart home energy optimizer that learns user energy consumption patterns and provides real-time recommendations for reducing energy waste.  This will focus on a simplified model, focusing on a single appliance for proof of concept and rapid prototyping. The significance lies in exploring AI-driven energy management within a constrained timeframe.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  Pandas (data manipulation), Scikit-learn (machine learning), Matplotlib (visualization)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  Smart power plug (e.g., TP-Link Kasa) for data acquisition (if time permits).  Otherwise, simulated data will suffice.


## Features & Requirements

- **Data Acquisition:** Collect simulated or real-time energy consumption data from a single appliance (e.g., a lamp).
- **Pattern Recognition:** Implement a simple machine learning model (e.g., linear regression or a basic decision tree) to identify usage patterns.
- **Real-time Recommendations:**  Based on learned patterns, provide suggestions to the user (e.g., "Turn off the lamp after 10 minutes of inactivity").
- **Energy Consumption Visualization:**  Display energy usage over time using a simple graph.
- **User Interface:** A basic command-line interface to display recommendations and data.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- Integration with a smart home platform (e.g., Home Assistant).
- More sophisticated ML models (e.g., LSTM for time series forecasting).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition/Simulation:** Create a dataset (simulated or real) representing the energy consumption of a chosen appliance over a short period.
2. **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., linear regression) to predict energy consumption based on time and other relevant factors (if available).
3. **Recommendation Engine:** Develop a simple rule-based system or use model predictions to generate energy-saving recommendations.
4. **UI Development:**  Create a basic command-line interface to display recommendations and energy usage graphs.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with new data and refine the model or recommendations as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Quality:** Simulated data might not accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.  If using real data, ensure sufficient data points are collected.
- **Model Complexity:** Balancing model complexity with prototyping time is crucial.  Overly complex models may not be feasible within the given timeframe.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of machine learning concepts:** Implementing and applying simple ML models for time series prediction.
- **Practical experience in data analysis and visualization:**  Working with real or simulated data to extract insights and visualize results.
