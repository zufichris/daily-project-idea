# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to build a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, up/down, circle) and translate them into commands to control smart home devices (simulated in this case). This allows for a more intuitive and hands-free interaction with smart home technology, without requiring a dedicated device like a smart speaker or mobile application.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), NumPy
* **Framework (optional):**  Streamlit (for a quick UI)
* **Tools:** Webcam, computer with Python and necessary libraries installed.


## Features & Requirements

- **Hand Detection and Tracking:**  Accurately detect and track a user's hand in real-time using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize predefined simple gestures (swipe left/right, up/down, circle).
- **Command Translation:** Map recognized gestures to specific commands (e.g., swipe left = decrease volume, swipe right = increase volume).
- **Simulation of Smart Home Control:**  Simulate the execution of commands (e.g., print commands to the console, control simulated lights/temperature values).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display the recognized gesture and the corresponding command on screen.


- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a simple calibration step to account for variations in hand size and lighting conditions.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Introduce additional gestures for more complex commands (e.g., two-finger pinch for pausing).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Hand Tracking:** Install necessary libraries and set up hand tracking using MediaPipe.  Test hand detection and tracking with the webcam.
2. **Gesture Feature Extraction:**  Extract relevant features from the tracked hand data (e.g., position, velocity, trajectory) to differentiate between gestures.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Train a simple classifier (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors or a basic machine learning model) to classify the extracted features into the predefined gestures.
4. **Command Mapping & Simulation:**  Map classified gestures to smart home commands and implement a simple simulation to visually represent the executed command (e.g., updating variables representing light intensity or temperature).
5. **UI Integration (Optional):** If time permits, integrate a simple user interface using Streamlit to display the recognized gestures and simulated commands.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness:** Handling variations in lighting, hand size, and background clutter in gesture recognition can be challenging.  Consider simple background subtraction techniques.
- **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in gesture recognition with a simple classifier might require careful feature selection and model training.  Focus on easily distinguishable gestures initially.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:**  This project provides hands-on experience in real-time hand tracking, feature extraction, and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Practical application of machine learning:**  The project demonstrates a simple application of machine learning for classification tasks.
