# Mini-Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple, yet engaging, 2D game with an AI opponent controlled by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm. The focus will be on implementing a rudimentary Q-learning agent to learn optimal strategies within a limited timeframe.  This showcases a practical application of RL in a manageable scope.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for game development)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)


## Features & Requirements
- **Core Game Mechanics:**  A simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe or a simplified version of Pong.
- **AI Opponent:**  An AI player that utilizes Q-learning to make moves.
- **Reward System:** A clearly defined reward system for the AI (e.g., +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, 0 for a draw).
- **Training Loop:**  A mechanism to train the AI agent through multiple game iterations.
- **Visual Representation:**  Display the game state and the AI's learning progress (e.g., Q-values).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for the AI.  Persistence of learned Q-values (saving and loading).


## Implementation Steps
1. **Game Setup:** Design and implement the core game logic using Pygame. Create functions for game initialization, move execution, win/loss/draw checks, and rendering.
2. **Q-learning Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm, defining the state space, action space, and reward function.
3. **Training Loop Integration:** Integrate the Q-learning algorithm into the game loop. Run multiple training iterations, updating the Q-table based on the game outcomes.
4. **Visualization:** Display the game visually using Pygame, potentially visualizing the Q-values or the AI's decision-making process.
5. **Evaluation (Optional):** If time allows, test the trained AI against a human player or a simple rule-based AI.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **State Space Representation:** Choosing an efficient representation for the game state crucial for Q-learning's performance, particularly in more complex games.  Overly large state spaces can lead to slow learning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Finding optimal learning rates and exploration parameters might require some experimentation.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of reinforcement learning concepts.
- Experience in designing and implementing a simple AI agent.
- Hands-on experience with Pygame for game development and visualization.
