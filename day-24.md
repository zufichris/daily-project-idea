# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with Mobile Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project focuses on building a basic system for real-time object detection and tracking using a mobile robot platform (simulated or physical). The system will detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the robot's camera view, track its movement, and navigate the robot towards it. This project is significant because it demonstrates fundamental concepts in computer vision, robotics, and control systems, which are crucial in various applications like autonomous vehicles and warehouse automation.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), TensorFlow/PyTorch (object detection model), ROS (Robot Operating System - if using a physical robot)
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi with camera, a small mobile robot platform (e.g., ROSbot, TurtleBot)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Object Detection:**  Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed using a pre-trained object detection model (YOLOv5, SSD MobileNet).
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position and movement across consecutive frames.
- **Robot Navigation:**  Command the robot to move towards the detected object using a simple control algorithm (e.g., proportional control).
- **Distance Estimation:** Estimate the distance to the tracked object using camera calibration and perspective geometry (optional).
- **Visual Feedback:** Display the camera feed, detected object bounding box, and robot control commands on the screen.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Object Detection:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and load a pre-trained object detection model.  Test the model on sample images/videos.
2. **Object Tracking:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using Kalman filter or optical flow) to track the detected object's centroid across frames.
3. **Robot Control (Simulation or Physical):**  If using simulation, implement robot control within the simulation environment. If using a physical robot, establish communication with the robot and implement the control algorithm using ROS.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the object detection, tracking, and robot control modules. Test the complete system.
5. **Distance Estimation (Optional):**  Implement distance estimation based on camera parameters and object size.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Cost:** Real-time object detection can be computationally intensive.  Consider using a lightweight object detection model and optimizing code for speed.
- **Robustness:**  The system's performance might be affected by lighting conditions, occlusions, and background clutter.  Addressing these challenges might require advanced tracking techniques and more sophisticated object detection models.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of real-time computer vision algorithms:**  Practical experience with object detection, tracking, and image processing.
- **Gain experience in robot control and navigation:** Implementing control algorithms and integrating them with computer vision.
