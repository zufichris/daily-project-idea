#  Miniature Drone Obstacle Avoidance with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary obstacle avoidance system for a miniature drone using reinforcement learning (RL).  The focus will be on a simplified simulated environment to allow for rapid prototyping and iterative improvement within a day or two.  This project showcases a practical application of RL in a constrained environment, highlighting core concepts without requiring extensive hardware setup.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Reinforcement Learning Library:** Stable Baselines3 (or similar)
* **Simulation Environment:** Pygame (for simplicity) or a lightweight physics engine like Pymunk.
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)


## Features & Requirements

- **Basic Drone Movement:**  The drone should be able to move forward, backward, left, and right in the simulated environment.
- **Obstacle Detection:**  Simple obstacle representation (e.g., squares or circles) within the simulation.
- **RL Agent Training:** A basic RL agent (e.g., PPO or DQN) trained to avoid obstacles.
- **Reward Function Design:** A reward function that incentivizes obstacle avoidance and efficient movement.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Basic metrics such as collision rate and distance traveled should be tracked.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Incorporate different obstacle types (varying sizes and shapes).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a more sophisticated reward function considering path length and proximity to obstacles.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a simple 2D simulation using Pygame, defining the drone's movement dynamics and obstacle placement.
2. **RL Agent Implementation:** Choose a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., PPO) from Stable Baselines3 and integrate it with the simulation environment.
3. **Reward Function Design:** Define a reward function that penalizes collisions and rewards efficient navigation.
4. **Agent Training:** Train the RL agent for a predetermined number of steps or until a satisfactory performance level is achieved.
5. **Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluate the agent's performance using metrics like collision rate and visualize its trajectory within the simulation.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Reward Function Engineering:** Designing an effective reward function that balances exploration and exploitation can be challenging. Careful consideration is needed to avoid sparse rewards leading to slow learning.
- **Simulation Complexity:** Balancing simplicity (for rapid prototyping) with sufficient realism to ensure the trained agent generalizes to more complex scenarios.  Overly simplified environments may not lead to robust solutions.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Principles:** This project will reinforce understanding of core RL concepts like agents, environments, reward functions, and policy optimization.
- **Agent-Environment Interaction:**  The project provides practical experience in designing and implementing the interaction between an RL agent and a simulated environment.
