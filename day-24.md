# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with a Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera.  The system will identify a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within the camera's field of view and track its movement, displaying the object's location on a live video feed. This provides a practical application of computer vision techniques within a constrained timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (any model), USB camera, monitor (optional)
- **Framework (optional):** TensorFlow Lite (for potentially faster inference if pre-trained model is used)

## Features & Requirements

- **Object Detection:**  Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the camera feed.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position frame-by-frame.
- **Visual Feedback:** Display a bounding box around the detected object on the live video feed.
- **Coordinate Output:** Provide real-time coordinates (x, y) of the object's center.
- **Frame Rate Reporting:** Display the frames per second (FPS) achieved.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Implement object classification to detect multiple object types.  Add a simple user interface for parameter adjustments (e.g., object color thresholds).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi and install necessary libraries (`pip install opencv-python numpy`).
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a simple color thresholding algorithm using OpenCV to detect the object. This can be refined with more sophisticated techniques like template matching or pre-trained models if time allows.
3. **Object Tracking:** Use OpenCV's tracking functions (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT_create()`) to track the detected object across frames, updating the bounding box and coordinates.
4. **Visual Feedback:** Display the live video feed with the bounding box overlaid. Use `cv2.putText()` to display the FPS and object coordinates.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with different lighting conditions and object movements. Adjust parameters (thresholds, tracking algorithm) to optimize performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Constraints:**  The Raspberry Pi might struggle with high-resolution video and complex algorithms.  Consider using a smaller resolution for the camera feed and simpler detection methods initially.
- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of color-based object detection.  Experiment with different thresholding techniques to mitigate this.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of OpenCV:** Gain experience with image processing, object detection, and tracking functionalities within OpenCV.
- **Real-time system development:** Understand the challenges and trade-offs involved in building a real-time system with limited computational resources.
