#  AI-Powered Smart Home Device Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home device controller that responds to both voice commands and hand gestures. The system will utilize a pre-trained speech recognition model and a simple computer vision model to interpret user input and control connected smart home devices (simulated for this daily challenge). This project showcases the integration of different AI models and demonstrates a practical application in the smart home domain.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  PyAudio (audio input), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), OpenCV (computer vision),  simple-websocket-client (websocket communication for simulated device control), potentially TensorFlow Lite or similar for on-device inference (if time allows).
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a microphone, potentially a Raspberry Pi or similar (for on-device inference, otherwise can run on a laptop).

## Features & Requirements
- **Voice Control:**  The system should recognize and respond to at least 5 basic voice commands (e.g., "Turn on lights," "Set temperature to 22 degrees," "Play music").
- **Gesture Control:**  The system should recognize 2-3 simple hand gestures (e.g., wave for "volume up," fist for "pause") using a pre-trained model or a simple custom-trained model using a small dataset.
- **Device Simulation:** The system simulates the control of smart devices by printing actions to the console (e.g., "Lights turned on").  This simulates the interaction with an API of a smart home ecosystem.
- **Real-time Processing:** The system should process voice and gesture inputs in real-time, with minimal latency.
- **Error Handling:**  Basic error handling for cases of unrecognized voice commands or gestures.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries and test audio and camera input.
2. **Voice Recognition:** Implement speech-to-text using SpeechRecognition and define a mapping between voice commands and simulated device actions.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Utilize a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model from a library or implement a very basic one using OpenCV to detect simple gestures.  Focus on speed and simplicity.
4. **Integration:** Combine voice and gesture recognition, creating a unified control system that prioritizes voice input if both are detected simultaneously.
5. **Simulation:** Create a function to simulate smart device control based on recognized commands, printing messages to the console.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Speech and Gesture Recognition:** Pre-trained models might not be perfect; address potential inaccuracies with error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- **Real-time Performance:** Balancing responsiveness with processing speed might require optimization techniques or simplifying the models if performance becomes an issue.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gain practical experience integrating different AI models (speech recognition and computer vision) into a single application.
- Strengthen skills in real-time processing and handling asynchronous events in a Python environment.
