# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures.  The system will prioritize ease of prototyping and demonstrating core functionalities within a short timeframe.  The significance lies in exploring the integration of multiple input modalities for intuitive smart home control.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyAudio (for audio input), OpenCV (for computer vision), SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text), a suitable library for the chosen smart appliance's API (e.g., home assistant API).
* **Hardware:**  A Raspberry Pi (or similar), a USB microphone, and a webcam.  The smart appliance itself.
* **Optional:** A suitable gesture recognition library (e.g., MediaPipe).


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should respond to voice commands like "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Increase brightness," etc.
- **Gesture Control:** The system should interpret simple hand gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, open palm for brightness increase, closed fist for brightness decrease).
- **Appliance Integration:** Seamless integration with a chosen smart home appliance via its API.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system should provide visual or auditory feedback to confirm the execution of commands.
- **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of incorrect voice commands or unrecognized gestures.

- **Advanced Features:**  Customizable voice profiles, a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuration.
- **Optional Feature:** Multi-appliance control (controlling multiple devices simultaneously).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the Raspberry Pi (or alternative). Connect the microphone and webcam.
2. **Voice command processing:** Implement the voice recognition using SpeechRecognition, handling potential errors and converting speech to commands for the chosen smart appliance.
3. **Gesture Recognition (simplified):** Implement basic gesture recognition using OpenCV.  For a daily challenge, focus on a limited set of simple gestures.
4. **Appliance API Integration:**  Integrate with the chosen smart appliance API to send commands based on voice and gesture inputs.
5. **Feedback and Refinement:** Implement basic feedback (e.g., printing commands to console). Test thoroughly and refine based on the results.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Speech and Gesture Recognition:**  Real-world conditions (noise, lighting) can affect accuracy. Consider using simple and robust recognition models to mitigate this.
- **API Limitations:**  The chosen appliance's API may have limitations in terms of supported commands or control options.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of integrating multiple input modalities (voice and vision) in a single application.
- Practical experience with real-time processing of audio and video data for control applications.
