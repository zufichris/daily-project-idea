# Automated Bug Report Summarizer

## Overview

This project aims to create a prototype of an automated system that summarizes bug reports from a given source (e.g., a text file, a Jira export) into concise, actionable summaries.  This is significant because it can significantly reduce the time spent triaging and understanding bug reports, especially in large software projects.  The focus for the daily challenge will be on a core summarization functionality.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Transformers library (e.g., Hugging Face) for summarization model (e.g., BART, T5)
- Regular expressions (re) for pre-processing
- Optional: Streamlit for a simple UI

## Features & Requirements

- **Core Functionality:**  Reads bug reports from a specified text file.
- **Summarization:** Uses a pre-trained summarization model to generate concise summaries of each bug report.
- **Output:** Writes the summarized reports to a new output file.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles errors like invalid file paths or malformed input.
- **Basic Preprocessing:** Cleans the input text (removing irrelevant characters, etc.).

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Categorization of bug reports based on summary (requires additional training data and a classifier model).
- **UI (Optional):**  Simple Streamlit app for file upload and summary viewing.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Acquire sample bug reports (e.g., create a dummy dataset or use a small subset of real data). Clean the data using regular expressions to remove unnecessary characters or formatting.
2. **Model Selection & Loading:** Choose a suitable pre-trained summarization model from the Transformers library (e.g., Facebook's BART or Google's T5). Load the model.
3. **Summarization Pipeline:**  Create a function that takes a bug report as input, preprocesses it (if necessary), passes it to the summarization model, and returns the generated summary.
4. **File Input/Output:** Implement functions to read bug reports from a specified file and write the generated summaries to a new file.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with your sample data and refine parameters (if necessary) for optimal summarization quality.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Performance:** Pre-trained models may not be perfectly suited for the specific style of bug reports. Experimentation with different models and fine-tuning may be necessary.  For a daily challenge, focus on using a readily available model.
- **Data Quality:**  The quality of the input bug reports significantly impacts the quality of the summaries.  Ensure a reasonable degree of data cleanliness.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of pre-trained NLP models for text summarization.
- Experience in using the Transformers library and handling NLP tasks in Python.
