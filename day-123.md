# Smart Home Device Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home device control system using real-time hand gesture recognition.  The system will allow users to control basic smart home functions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume) using pre-defined gestures captured by a webcam. This offers a novel, hands-free, and intuitive interaction method compared to traditional voice or app-based controls.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision and image processing), MediaPipe (for hand pose estimation), PyAutoGUI (for automating GUI interactions), RPi.GPIO (if integrating with physical relays for direct device control).
- **Hardware:** Webcam (integrated or external), Raspberry Pi (optional, for direct device control).
- **Software:**  A suitable IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:**  Accurately detect and classify predefined hand gestures (e.g., fist for "off," open palm for "on," thumbs up for "increase volume").
- **Smart Home Device Control:**  Integrate with existing smart home APIs or utilize simple relay circuits to control lights, fans, or speakers.
- **GUI for Gesture Calibration:** A simple graphical interface allowing users to calibrate the system by teaching it their gestures.
- **Gesture Recognition Accuracy Monitoring:** Display a confidence score for the recognized gesture to indicate the system's certainty.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage situations like poor lighting or gesture ambiguity.

- **Advanced Features:**  Support for more complex gestures (e.g., swiping for volume control).
- **Optional Feature:**  Integration with a voice assistant for a hybrid control system.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, RPi.GPIO if needed).  Set up a webcam and test its functionality.
2. **Hand Gesture Detection:** Implement hand detection and pose estimation using MediaPipe.  Train a simple classifier (e.g., using a small dataset of images for each gesture) or leverage pre-trained models.
3. **Smart Home Integration:**  Connect to your smart home ecosystem's API or set up basic relay circuits to control target devices. Map detected gestures to corresponding control commands.
4. **GUI Development:** Create a basic GUI (e.g., using Tkinter or PyQt) to allow users to calibrate gestures and monitor recognition accuracy.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system extensively, adjusting parameters and refining the gesture recognition accuracy as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can significantly impact the accuracy of hand detection.  Explore techniques for improving robustness to lighting changes (e.g., image preprocessing).
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Similar gestures might be misinterpreted.  Focus on designing distinct gestures and implementing effective classification methods to minimize errors.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision techniques:**  Practical experience with hand detection, pose estimation, and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Develop skills in integrating software with hardware:**  Experience in interfacing with physical devices (optional, if using Raspberry Pi and relays) or APIs for smart home control.
