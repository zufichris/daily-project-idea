# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a simple, self-calibrating system for a robotic arm using computer vision. The goal is to create a program that automatically determines the robot's end-effector position in 3D space using a camera and known calibration objects. This improves precision and reduces manual setup time, crucial for many robotic applications.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), NumPy (numerical computation), potentially a robotic arm control library (e.g., ROS, PySerial depending on the arm)
* **Hardware:** A robotic arm (even a simple one), a webcam or camera, and a calibration object (e.g., a checkerboard).

## Features & Requirements

- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) using a checkerboard pattern.
- **Object Detection:** Detect the checkerboard pattern in the camera image.
- **3D Pose Estimation:** Estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of the checkerboard relative to the camera.
- **Robot Arm Control (Optional):**  Move the robot arm to a specific location based on the estimated pose.
- **Position Reporting:** Display the calculated position of the robot's end-effector in 3D space.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function with images of a checkerboard to obtain camera parameters.
2. **Checkerboard Detection:** Detect the checkerboard in real-time using OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners` function.
3. **Pose Estimation:** Employ the camera parameters and checkerboard corner coordinates to estimate the checkerboard's pose using `solvePnP`.  Assume the checkerboard's dimensions are known.
4. **Coordinate Transformation (Optional):** Transform the checkerboard's pose into the robot's coordinate system.  This requires knowing the relative position and orientation of the camera and the robot arm.
5. **Visualisation & Reporting:** Display the calculated 3D position of the robot's end-effector in a user interface or console.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the system depends heavily on the quality of the camera calibration and the precision of the robot's movements.  Noise in the image can also affect the results.
- **Coordinate System Transformation:**  Transforming coordinates between the camera and robot frames requires careful consideration of rotations and translations, potentially using homogeneous transformation matrices.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Reinforces understanding of camera calibration, feature detection, and pose estimation techniques.
- **Robotic Arm Control (if implemented):** Provides practical experience in controlling a robot arm based on sensor data.
