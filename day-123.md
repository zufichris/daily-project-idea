# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with OpenCV

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time object tracking and classification system using OpenCV.  The system will identify and track a pre-defined object (e.g., a red ball) within a video stream from a webcam.  This project is significant because it demonstrates fundamental computer vision techniques and provides a foundation for more advanced applications like autonomous navigation or surveillance systems.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- A webcam or video file

## Features & Requirements
- **Object Detection:**  Detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) in the video stream.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement frame-by-frame using a suitable tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter or CSRT).
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Display a bounding box around the tracked object in real-time.
- **Centroid Tracking:** Calculate and display the centroid coordinates of the tracked object.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.

- **Advanced Features:** Implement object classification using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5) to identify the object's type.
- **Optional Feature:** Save the tracked object's trajectory to a file.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy).  Test webcam connectivity.
2. **Object Detection:** Implement a color-based object detection algorithm (e.g., thresholding and contour detection) to identify the object of interest.
3. **Object Tracking:** Choose and implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., OpenCV's built-in trackers like CSRT or KCF).
4. **Visualization:** Overlay a bounding box and centroid coordinates on the video stream using OpenCV's drawing functions.
5. **Performance Evaluation:**  Calculate and display the FPS to measure the system's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Computational Cost:** Real-time processing can be computationally intensive, especially with complex tracking algorithms or high-resolution video.  Consider optimizing the code and potentially reducing the video resolution if necessary.
- **Object Occlusion:**  The tracking algorithm might lose the object if it's temporarily occluded.  Robust tracking algorithms can mitigate this, but it's important to be aware of this limitation.


## Learning Outcomes
- This project reinforces understanding of OpenCV's capabilities for image processing and video analysis.
- Practical experience is gained in implementing and comparing different object tracking algorithms.
