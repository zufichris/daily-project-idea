# Real-time Object Tracking with Color Segmentation

## Overview
This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking system using color segmentation.  The system will identify and track a specific colored object within a video stream (e.g., a webcam feed). This is a foundational computer vision task with applications in robotics, surveillance, and augmented reality.  The daily challenge focuses on achieving robust tracking even with slight variations in lighting or object orientation.

## Technologies & Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
- Tools:  A webcam or video file.

## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Processing:**  The system should process video frames from a webcam in real-time, displaying the tracked object with a bounding box.
- **Color Segmentation:**  The system should utilize color thresholding or a more advanced technique (e.g., HSV color space) to isolate the target object based on its color.
- **Object Tracking:** The system should track the object's centroid across consecutive frames, providing continuous tracking information (e.g., x, y coordinates).
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** The tracked object should be highlighted with a bounding box on the video display.
- **FPS Display:** Display the frames per second (FPS) to assess performance.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Kalman filter for smoother tracking;  handling partial occlusion.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup and Initialization:** Import necessary libraries, initialize the webcam, and define color thresholds for the target object (e.g., using HSV color space for better robustness).
2. **Color Segmentation:** Process each frame, converting it to the HSV color space and applying the defined color thresholds to create a binary mask isolating the target object.
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** Find contours in the binary mask, identify the largest contour (assuming it's the target), and calculate its centroid.  Track the centroid across frames.
4. **Visualization:** Draw a bounding box around the detected object on the original video frame and display the FPS.
5. **Refinement and Testing:**  Test the system with different lighting conditions and object orientations. Adjust color thresholds or implement more sophisticated tracking algorithms if needed.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Robust Color Segmentation:**  Accurately segmenting the target object from the background can be challenging due to variations in lighting, shadows, and object orientation. Experiment with different color spaces and thresholding techniques.
- **Handling Occlusion:** If the target object is partially or fully occluded, the tracking algorithm might fail. Implementing techniques to handle occlusion (e.g., Kalman filter prediction) would improve robustness, but might be beyond a single day's scope.


## Learning Outcomes
- This project reinforces practical skills in real-time image processing, color segmentation, and object tracking using OpenCV.
- It provides experience in working with image manipulation, contour detection, and algorithmic optimization for real-time performance.
