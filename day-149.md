# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, AI opponent for a classic game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four using reinforcement learning (RL).  The focus is on rapid prototyping and demonstrating basic RL concepts within a constrained timeframe.  The AI will learn through self-play, improving its strategy over a series of games.  The significance lies in experiencing the core principles of RL in a practical, easily understandable context.


## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `gym`, `stable-baselines3` (or a similar RL library)
* **Optional:** Jupyter Notebook for interactive development


## Features & Requirements

- **Game Environment:**  A functional implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four game environment.
- **RL Agent:** A reinforcement learning agent trained using a chosen algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
- **Training Loop:** A mechanism to train the agent through self-play, iteratively improving its policy.
- **Game Simulation:**  Ability to simulate games between the trained AI and a random player or a human player.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Simple metrics to track the agent's win rate and learning progress.

- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Visualization of the agent's learning curve (e.g., win rate over time).
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):**  Implementation of a different RL algorithm for comparison.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create the game environment using Python and define the state space, action space, and reward function.
2. **Agent Selection & Initialization:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., PPO from `stable-baselines3`) and initialize the agent.
3. **Training:** Run the training loop, letting the agent play numerous games against itself.  Monitor progress using simple metrics.  Adjust hyperparameters if needed for faster convergence.
4. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the trained agent's performance against a random player or a human player.
5. **Visualization (Optional):** Plot the agent's learning curve to visually assess its progress.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for the chosen RL algorithm within the limited timeframe might be challenging.  Start with default values and potentially adjust based on initial observations.
- **Computational Resources:** Training a sophisticated RL agent might require significant computational resources.  Consider simplifying the game or limiting the training iterations to stay within a daily time constraint.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals:** Gain hands-on experience with core RL concepts like agents, environments, rewards, and policy learning.
- **Practical Application of RL Libraries:**  Develop proficiency in using RL libraries like `stable-baselines3` for rapid prototyping and algorithm implementation.
