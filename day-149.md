# Self-Balancing Robot Control using PID Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to stabilize a two-wheeled self-balancing robot.  The goal is to create a basic control system that can maintain the robot's upright position, showcasing the principles of PID control in a tangible application. While a fully functional robot might take longer, the core control algorithm can be developed and tested within a day or two using simulation.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  NumPy, SciPy (for PID control implementation), Matplotlib (for visualization)
* **Simulation Environment (optional):**  V-REP, Gazebo, or a custom simulation using Pygame.  A simpler approach would involve a mathematical model.

## Features & Requirements

- **Balance Maintenance:** The core functionality is to keep the robot upright against disturbances.
- **PID Parameter Tuning:** Implement a method for adjusting the P, I, and D gains to optimize stability.
- **Sensor Input Simulation:** Simulate the tilt angle (using a simulated accelerometer) and angular velocity (using a simulated gyroscope).
- **Motor Control Simulation:** Simulate motor outputs based on the controller's signal.
- **Visual Feedback:** Real-time graphical visualization of robot angle, motor commands, and error.

- **Advanced Features:**  Implementation of a Kalman filter for sensor fusion.
- **Optional Feature:**  Integration with a real-world robot using a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and appropriate sensors and motors.  (This would exceed the two-day timeframe.)


## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Development:** Create a simplified mathematical model of the robot's dynamics, including the relationship between tilt angle, angular velocity, motor commands, and robot motion.
2. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement a PID controller in Python using NumPy and SciPy.  Initialize PID gains with reasonable starting values.
3. **Simulation:**  Simulate sensor inputs (angle and angular velocity) and motor outputs. Integrate the PID controller with the model to simulate the robot's behavior.
4. **Tuning and Testing:**  Adjust PID gains to minimize oscillations and stabilize the robot's upright position. This is iterative; observe the system's response and fine-tune the gains.
5. **Visualization:**  Use Matplotlib to plot the robot's angle, motor commands, and error over time, providing visual feedback on the controller's performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Gain Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains can be challenging and may require iterative adjustments.  Consider using Ziegler-Nichols tuning methods as a starting point.
- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the simulation depends on the precision of the robot's mathematical model.  Simpler models may lead to less accurate results.


## Learning Outcomes

- **PID Control:**  Gain practical experience implementing and tuning a PID controller, a fundamental control algorithm used across many engineering disciplines.
- **System Modeling:** Develop skills in creating simplified models for dynamic systems, a crucial step in control system design.
