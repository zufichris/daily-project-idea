# Real-time Object Tracking and Classification with a Webcam

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple real-time object tracking and classification system using a webcam feed. The system will detect and track a specific object (e.g., a red ball) and classify it. This provides a practical application of computer vision techniques, suitable for a daily challenge.  The significance lies in demonstrating a fundamental aspect of AI-powered applications such as autonomous robots or surveillance systems.


## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), TensorFlow/Keras (for optional advanced classification), NumPy
- **Tools:**  A webcam, a computer with Python and necessary libraries installed.


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Capture and display the webcam feed.
- **Object Detection:** Detect a pre-defined object (e.g., color, shape) in the video stream.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's movement across frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object.
- **Basic Performance Metrics:** Optionally display FPS (frames per second) for performance evaluation.

- **Advanced Feature 1 (Optional):**  Object Classification - Use a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet) to classify the tracked object beyond simple color/shape detection.
- **Advanced Feature 2 (Optional):**  Multiple Object Tracking - Track multiple instances of the target object simultaneously.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Webcam Access:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras if needed), establish a connection to the webcam, and capture frames.
2. **Object Detection & Tracking:** Implement a simple color thresholding or shape detection algorithm to identify the target object in each frame.  Use OpenCV's tracking functions (e.g., `cv2.TrackerCSRT`) to track the object across frames.
3. **Bounding Box & Visualization:** Draw a bounding box around the tracked object on each frame using OpenCV's drawing functions. Display the resulting video stream.
4. **Performance Measurement (Optional):** Calculate and display FPS to assess performance.
5. **Classification (Optional):** Integrate a pre-trained classification model to classify the detected object.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Object Occlusion:**  The algorithm might struggle if the target object is temporarily hidden from the camera. Robust tracking algorithms are needed to handle this.  A simple approach might be to use a more sophisticated tracking method than simple color thresholding.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Changes in lighting can significantly affect color detection.  Consider using techniques to improve robustness to varying lighting conditions.  This might be left for the optional advanced features.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of computer vision concepts:** This project provides practical experience with image processing, object detection, and tracking.
- **Hands-on experience with OpenCV:** The project improves familiarity with OpenCV's functions for video processing, object detection, and visualization.
