# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a rudimentary prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures.  The system will demonstrate a fusion of speech recognition and computer vision, offering a multimodal interface for increased user convenience and accessibility.  This prototype focuses on a single appliance to maintain feasibility within a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `SpeechRecognition` (for voice command processing)
    * `OpenCV` (for computer vision and gesture recognition)
    * `pyautogui` (for simulated appliance control - can be replaced with direct hardware interaction if applicable)
* **Hardware (Optional):**  A webcam, a smart lamp/fan with an API or controllable via software (e.g., simulated using pyautogui).


## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  Recognize simple commands like "Turn on," "Turn off," "Brighter," "Dimmer" (for a lamp) or "Faster," "Slower" (for a fan).
- **Gesture Control:** Detect basic hand gestures like a raised hand (on/off) and open/closed hand (brightness/speed control).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual or auditory feedback to the user confirming the received command and the appliance's status.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle unrecognized voice commands and gestures.
- **Configuration:** Allow users to easily customize voice commands and gesture mappings.


**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Multiple Appliance Support:** Extend the system to control multiple appliances.
- **Machine Learning Model Integration:** Train a custom gesture recognition model for improved accuracy.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries and configure the hardware (if used).
2. **Develop Voice Recognition Module:** Implement speech recognition using `SpeechRecognition`, mapping voice commands to appliance control actions.
3. **Develop Gesture Recognition Module:** Use `OpenCV` to detect predefined hand gestures and translate them into control actions.  Start with simple threshold-based techniques for a quick prototype.
4. **Integrate Modules and Implement Feedback:** Combine the voice and gesture modules, ensuring real-time feedback to the user. Use `pyautogui` to simulate appliance control for testing.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test thoroughly with various voice commands and gestures, refining the accuracy and robustness of the system.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Achieving high accuracy with simple gesture recognition can be challenging due to variations in lighting, hand position, and background noise.  Consider simplifying the gesture set initially.
- **Real-time Processing:** Balancing real-time processing with accuracy can be demanding, requiring optimization of code and potentially trade-offs in functionality.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Interface Design:** Gain experience in designing and implementing systems that utilize multiple input modalities (voice and vision).
- **Real-time Image Processing:**  Develop skills in using OpenCV for real-time image processing and feature extraction, specifically for gesture recognition.
