# Automated Code Style Enforcement Bot

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple bot that automatically enforces a consistent code style within a specified code repository. The bot will analyze code commits, identify style violations based on a predefined style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python), and provide feedback to the developer. This promotes code readability, maintainability, and team consistency.  The focus will be on a single language (Python) for this daily challenge.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pylint`, `gitpython`, `requests` (or similar for GitHub API interaction)
- **Tools:** GitHub CLI (optional, for local testing and easier interaction),  a suitable text editor or IDE.

## Features & Requirements

- **Automated Style Check:** Analyze Python code commits for style violations using `pylint`.
- **Commit Feedback:** Generate comments on pull requests (PRs) highlighting specific style violations.
- **Configurable Style Guide:**  Allow for easy modification of the style guide being enforced (e.g., using a configuration file).
- **GitHub Integration:**  Post comments directly on PRs using the GitHub API.
- **Basic Reporting:** Provide a summary of violations found in a commit (e.g., total number of violations).

- **Advanced Feature:**  Prioritize violations based on severity.
- **Optional Feature:** Implement support for multiple code repositories.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Configuration:** Install necessary libraries (`pip install pylint gitpython requests`).  Set up a configuration file for `pylint` with the desired style rules.  If using GitHub integration, obtain a personal access token.

2. **Code Analysis:** Develop a Python script that uses `gitpython` to parse commits and extract changed files. Then utilize `pylint` to analyze the changed code in those files and identify violations.

3. **Feedback Generation:**  Create functions to format the violation details into human-readable messages suitable for GitHub comments.

4. **GitHub API Interaction (Optional, but recommended):** Use the `requests` library to interact with the GitHub API to post comments on pull requests. This step can be initially bypassed for local testing and prototyping.

5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the script with sample commits containing various style violations. Refine the script to handle different scenarios and improve feedback clarity.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **GitHub API Rate Limits:**  The GitHub API has rate limits.  Handling these limits (e.g., implementing delays) is crucial for a robust bot.
- **False Positives:** `pylint` might report false positives.  Fine-tuning the configuration or incorporating logic to filter out minor or irrelevant violations is necessary.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of Git and GitHub APIs:**  Gain hands-on experience with interacting with Git repositories programmatically and utilizing the GitHub API for automation.
- **Code Style Enforcement & Best Practices:** Understand the importance of consistent code style and learn how to enforce it automatically. This improves overall code quality and team collaboration.
