# Smart Home Appliance Control via Voice & Gesture

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype system for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using both voice commands and hand gestures. This combines two popular interaction methods, allowing for a more intuitive and flexible user experience. The focus will be on a quick and functional prototype, not a polished, production-ready system.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyAudio (audio input), SpeechRecognition (speech-to-text), OpenCV (computer vision for gesture recognition), RPi.GPIO (for GPIO control if using a Raspberry Pi), a suitable library for controlling the specific smart appliance (e.g., a library for controlling Philips Hue lights).
* **Hardware (Optional):** Raspberry Pi (or similar single-board computer), webcam, smart home appliance.  If skipping hardware, the project can simulate appliance control.
* **Tools:** IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), Git for version control.

## Features & Requirements

- **Voice Control:**  The system should recognize simple voice commands (e.g., "Turn on the lamp," "Turn off the fan," "Increase brightness").
- **Gesture Control:** The system should recognize a predefined set of hand gestures (e.g., waving hand for on/off, fist for brightness adjustment).
- **Appliance Integration:** The system must successfully interact with a chosen smart home appliance.
- **Error Handling:** The system should provide feedback (e.g., via text output) if a command is not recognized.
- **Basic UI (Optional):** A simple text-based UI displaying the current status of the appliance.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment & Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries and configure the development environment.
2. **Voice Command Processing:** Implement speech recognition using PyAudio and SpeechRecognition.  Focus on recognizing a small set of keywords for simplicity.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** Use OpenCV to capture video from the webcam (or simulated input), implement a basic gesture recognition algorithm (e.g., detecting a wave or fist).  Use simplified image processing techniques for a rapid prototype.
4. **Appliance Control:** Integrate with chosen smart appliance's API or direct GPIO control if using a Raspberry Pi.
5. **Combine and Test:** Integrate voice and gesture controls, testing thoroughly with the chosen appliance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Robustness of Gesture Recognition:**  Simple gesture recognition can be unreliable due to lighting conditions, background clutter, and variations in hand positioning. Focus on a very limited set of gestures for this rapid prototype.
- **Accuracy of Speech Recognition:**  Speech recognition accuracy depends on the environment and microphone quality. Consider using a clear, quiet environment during testing.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Multimodal Interaction Design:**  Reinforces understanding of combining different input modalities (voice and gesture) for a richer user experience.
- **Real-time Processing:**  This project provides practical experience in handling real-time data streams (audio and video) and reacting quickly to user input.
