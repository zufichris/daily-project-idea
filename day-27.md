# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a tinyML-based gesture recognition system that can control simple smart home devices.  The focus is on minimizing resource usage and maximizing efficiency for deployment on a microcontroller.  This demonstrates the practical application of tinyML in resource-constrained environments.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** MicroPython (or C/C++ for higher performance)
* **Microcontroller:**  ESP32-CAM (for built-in camera) or similar with readily available machine learning libraries.
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro (for model inference)
* **IDE:** PlatformIO, Arduino IDE, or similar.
* **Tools:**  LabelImg (for data annotation)


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:** The system will capture images from the camera.
- **Real-time Inference:** A pre-trained TensorFlow Lite Micro model will perform gesture classification in real-time.
- **Device Control:**  The system will trigger pre-defined actions (e.g., turning on/off a light, adjusting volume) based on recognized gestures.
- **Model Optimization:** The model should be optimized for size and speed to work effectively on the microcontroller.
- **User Interface (Optional):** A simple visual indicator (LED) to show recognized gestures.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Gesture Support:**  Expanding beyond a basic set of gestures (e.g., waving, thumbs up/down).
- **Calibration:** Allowing for user-specific gesture calibration.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Annotation:** Collect a small dataset of images representing the target gestures (e.g., 50-100 images per gesture). Annotate these images using LabelImg.
2. **Model Training (Pre-trained Model):** Use a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub or a similar repository as a starting point.  Fine-tune it with the collected dataset (or use transfer learning).  Quantize the model for optimal performance on the microcontroller.
3. **Microcontroller Integration:** Transfer the optimized model to the ESP32-CAM.  Implement the image capture and inference logic within the MicroPython (or C/C++) code.
4. **Device Control Integration:**  Connect the microcontroller to the smart home device (e.g., using ESP-NOW or WiFi) and implement the control logic based on gesture recognition.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system thoroughly and refine the model or parameters as needed to improve accuracy and responsiveness.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Optimization:** Finding the right balance between model accuracy and inference speed on the limited resources of the microcontroller can be challenging.  Experimentation with different model architectures and quantization techniques is crucial.
- **Data Collection:** Ensuring sufficient data variety and quality for reliable gesture recognition is vital.  Consider using data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of the model.


## Learning Outcomes

- **TinyML Implementation:** This project provides hands-on experience in deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices.
- **Embedded Systems Programming:**  Reinforces skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time processing.
