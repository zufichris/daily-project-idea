# Smart Home Appliance Control via Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for controlling a smart home appliance (e.g., a smart lamp or fan) using real-time hand gesture recognition. This will involve capturing hand gestures via a webcam, processing the video stream to identify specific gestures, and translating these gestures into commands to control the appliance via a network interface (e.g., using an existing smart home platform's API).  The significance lies in exploring a more intuitive and hands-free interaction method for smart home devices.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for gesture recognition), requests (for API interaction)
* **Hardware:** Webcam,  Smart Home Appliance (e.g., a Philips Hue bulb or a smart fan with an accessible API)
* **Optional:**  A Raspberry Pi for a more portable solution


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Capture:** Real-time capture and processing of hand gestures from a webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognition of at least three distinct gestures (e.g., wave for on/off, fist for brightness/speed increase, open palm for brightness/speed decrease).
- **Appliance Control:** Sending commands to the chosen smart home appliance based on the recognized gestures.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Displaying the recognized gesture and the appliance's current state on the screen.
- **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of situations where gestures are not correctly recognized.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Calibration to adapt to different lighting conditions and hand sizes.
- **Advanced Feature 2:**  Integration with a voice assistant for combined control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, requests). Configure the smart home applianceâ€™s API access.
2. **Gesture Recognition Pipeline:** Implement a pipeline using MediaPipe to detect and classify hand gestures from the webcam feed.  Focus on a small set of easily distinguishable gestures.
3. **API Integration:** Write functions to send commands (on/off, brightness/speed adjustment) to the smart home appliance via its API based on the recognized gestures.
4. **User Interface:** Create a basic GUI (e.g., using OpenCV's display functions) to show the recognized gesture and the appliance's status.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with different hand gestures and lighting conditions.  Refine gesture recognition parameters for improved accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy of Gesture Recognition:**  Dealing with variations in hand size, lighting conditions, and background noise can impact the accuracy of gesture recognition.  Careful selection of gestures and robust algorithms are crucial.
- **API Limitations:** The specific API of the smart home appliance might have limitations or require specific authentication methods.


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce practical skills in computer vision and real-time video processing using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Gain experience in integrating different software components (computer vision, network communication, GUI) to build a functional system.
