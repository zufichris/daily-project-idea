# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using real-time micro-gesture recognition from a webcam feed.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, thumbs down, hand wave) to control specific smart home devices, demonstrating the feasibility of hands-free, intuitive interaction.  This offers a user-friendly alternative to voice assistants or touchscreens, particularly useful in noisy environments or for users with limited mobility.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (for computer vision), MediaPipe (for gesture recognition),  pyautogui (for simulated keyboard/mouse input, optional)
* **Tools:**  A webcam,  a suitable development environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Gesture Detection:**  Accurately recognize predefined hand gestures from the webcam feed.
- **Device Control Mapping:**  Map recognized gestures to specific actions (e.g., thumbs up = increase volume, thumbs down = decrease volume).
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide visual or auditory feedback to the user indicating successful gesture recognition.
- **Robustness to Noise:**  The system should be reasonably resilient to variations in lighting and background.
- **Modular Design:**  The system should be easily extensible to support more gestures and devices.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple User Support:**  Distinguish between multiple users based on hand features.
- **Integration with a Smart Home Platform:**  Connect the system to a platform like Home Assistant for actual device control.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Environment:** Install necessary libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, pyautogui).  Test the webcam functionality.
2. **Gesture Recognition Pipeline:** Implement the core gesture recognition using MediaPipe's hand tracking solutions.  Focus on recognizing 2-3 simple gestures.
3. **Action Mapping:** Create a mapping between recognized gestures and desired actions (e.g., simulated keyboard presses, or commands to a virtual smart home system).
4. **Feedback Implementation:** Add a simple visual feedback (e.g., displaying the recognized gesture on screen) or auditory feedback (e.g., a sound).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various lighting conditions and gestures.  Refine the gesture recognition parameters for optimal performance.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Accuracy and Robustness:**  Achieving high accuracy in real-time gesture recognition can be challenging, especially with variations in lighting, hand position, and background.  Consider using image preprocessing techniques to improve robustness.
- **Computational Cost:**  Real-time processing can be computationally intensive.  Optimize the code for efficient processing and consider using hardware acceleration if necessary.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Application of Computer Vision:**  Gain hands-on experience in using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
- **Development of a Real-time System:**  Understand the challenges and techniques involved in building responsive, real-time applications.
