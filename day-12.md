# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system based on micro-gestures captured by a webcam.  The system will recognize simple hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, up/down, pinch) and map them to specific smart home actions (e.g., adjusting volume, changing channels, turning lights on/off).  This is a valuable exploration of computer vision and its application in creating intuitive human-computer interfaces.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), NumPy
* **Tools:**  Webcam, Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)


## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  Accurately track hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize predefined simple gestures (swipe left/right, up/down, pinch).
- **Action Mapping:** Map recognized gestures to specific smart home actions (simulated initially, could integrate with a smart home API later).
- **User Interface:**  A simple visualization of the detected hand and recognized gesture.
- **Accuracy Metrics:** Basic accuracy tracking (percentage of correctly recognized gestures).

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Calibration:** Allow users to calibrate their hand position for improved accuracy.
- **Multiple User Support:**  Distinguish between multiple users based on hand position/size.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Hand Tracking:** Set up the environment, install necessary libraries, and implement real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe.  Focus on extracting relevant hand landmark coordinates.
2. **Gesture Definition & Recognition:** Define thresholds and criteria for recognizing the predefined gestures based on the hand landmark movements and distances.
3. **Action Mapping & Simulation:** Create a simple mapping between recognized gestures and simulated smart home actions (e.g., print to the console "Lights ON").
4. **User Interface Development:** Create a basic graphical interface (using OpenCV or a simple GUI library like Tkinter) to display the video feed, detected hand, and recognized gesture.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the system with various hand gestures and adjust recognition thresholds to improve accuracy.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Variations in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of hand tracking.  Consider using techniques like background subtraction or adaptive thresholding.
- **Gesture Ambiguity:**  Some gestures might be difficult to distinguish.  Explore more robust gesture recognition algorithms or incorporate additional sensors (e.g., depth sensors) to improve accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals:**  Gain practical experience in real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):**  Understand the principles of designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for interaction with smart devices.
