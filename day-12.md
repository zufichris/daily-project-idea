# Optimized Robot Path Planning with A*

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and visualizing an A* search algorithm for robot path planning in a simulated 2D environment.  The goal is to find the shortest and most efficient path for a robot to navigate from a starting point to a goal point, avoiding obstacles.  This is a fundamental problem in robotics with applications in autonomous navigation, warehouse automation, and more.  The daily challenge will be to implement a functional prototype with visualization and explore optimizations.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pygame (for visualization), NumPy (for array manipulation)
* **Algorithm:** A* search algorithm

## Features & Requirements

- **Map Representation:**  A 2D grid representing the environment with obstacles.
- **Pathfinding:** Implement the A* algorithm to find the optimal path.
- **Visualization:** Display the map, obstacles, start/goal points, and the calculated path using Pygame.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The algorithm must successfully navigate around obstacles.
- **Path Smoothing (Optional):** Implement a simple path smoothing algorithm (e.g., BÃ©zier curves) to reduce sharp turns.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a heuristic function that considers the robot's turning radius for more realistic path planning.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Create a 2D grid map with randomly placed obstacles using NumPy. Initialize the start and goal positions.
2. **A* Implementation:** Implement the A* search algorithm, including heuristic function (Manhattan distance initially), open/closed lists, and path reconstruction.
3. **Visualization:** Use Pygame to display the grid, obstacles, start/goal, and the path found by A*.
4. **Testing & Refinement:** Test the algorithm with various map configurations and obstacle densities.  Refine the parameters as needed for optimal performance.
5. **Optional: Path Smoothing:** If time allows, implement a path smoothing algorithm to improve the path's aesthetics and potentially reduce its length.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Heuristic Function:** Choosing an appropriate heuristic function is crucial for A*'s efficiency. Experimenting with different heuristics might be necessary.
- **Computational Complexity:** For large maps, A* can become computationally expensive.  Consider strategies for optimizing the search (e.g., using a priority queue).


## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforce understanding and implementation of graph search algorithms (specifically A*).
- Gain practical experience in using Python libraries for visualization and numerical computation.
