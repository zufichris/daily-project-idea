# Micro-Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a smart home control system using a low-cost depth camera (like Intel RealSense) and machine learning to recognize simple hand gestures.  The goal is to create a responsive system capable of interpreting a few predefined gestures to control smart home devices (lights, music, etc.) without the need for a physical remote or voice commands. This offers a novel and intuitive interaction method.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (gesture recognition), scikit-learn (machine learning, potentially),  a suitable smart home API (e.g., Home Assistant API).
* **Tools:** Intel RealSense depth camera (or similar), a computer with a capable GPU (for faster processing if using ML models).

## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Recognition:**  Recognize at least three distinct hand gestures (e.g., wave for lights on/off, thumbs up for volume up, thumbs down for volume down).
- **Real-time Processing:**  Process and react to gestures with minimal latency.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Send commands to a simulated or real smart home environment (lights, music player).
- **Calibration:** Allow for easy calibration of the gesture recognition model to adapt to different lighting conditions and user variations.
- **Visual Feedback:**  Provide visual feedback (e.g., on-screen display) indicating recognized gestures.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**

- **Gesture Sequencing:**  Recognize sequences of gestures for more complex commands (e.g., two waves to dim the lights).
- **Model Training/Refinement:** Incorporate a simple machine learning model to improve gesture recognition accuracy over time.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data Acquisition:**  Set up the development environment, connect the depth camera, and capture a dataset of the chosen hand gestures using OpenCV.  This dataset can be very small for a basic prototype.
2. **Gesture Processing:** Use MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities to extract relevant features from the captured video frames (e.g., landmark positions).
3. **Gesture Classification (Basic):** Implement a simple rule-based system to classify the extracted features into the predefined gestures.  For example,  use threshold values for landmark distances to distinguish between gestures.
4. **Smart Home Control:** Integrate with a chosen smart home API to send commands to control virtual or real devices based on the recognized gestures.
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test the system and refine the classification rules or the machine learning model to improve accuracy.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Lighting Conditions:**  Depth camera accuracy can be affected by varying lighting conditions. Robust preprocessing steps might be needed.
- **Gesture Variability:**  Different users might perform gestures differently.  Designing the system to be tolerant of some variation is key.  Using a small, well-defined set of gestures helps with this.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Real-time Computer Vision:** Hands-on experience with real-time video processing and feature extraction.
- **Integration with external APIs:**  Developing skills in interfacing software with external hardware and APIs.
