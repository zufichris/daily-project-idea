# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple, real-time object detection and tracking system using a web browser and WebRTC.  The system will detect a predefined object (e.g., a red ball) in a video stream from a webcam, track its movement, and display the tracking information (e.g., coordinates, velocity) on the webpage. This demonstrates practical application of computer vision and real-time communication technologies.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: JavaScript (with Node.js for potential server-side processing if advanced features are implemented)
- Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow.js (for object detection), WebRTC (for real-time video streaming)
- Tools:  VS Code or similar IDE, a webcam

## Features & Requirements

- **Real-time Video Capture:** Acquire video stream from the user's webcam using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:** Employ a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model to detect a specific object (e.g., a red ball) within the video frames.
- **Object Tracking:** Track the detected object's position across consecutive frames.
- **Display Tracking Data:** Show the object's coordinates (x,y) and optionally its velocity on the webpage.
- **User Interface:**  A simple HTML interface to display the video feed and tracking data.

- **Advanced Features (Optional):**  Server-side processing for multiple client tracking & analysis.  Adding a different object detection model (e.g., for face detection).


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Create a basic HTML file with a video element and a canvas for displaying tracking data. Include the necessary TensorFlow.js and WebRTC libraries.
2. **WebRTC Integration:** Implement WebRTC to capture the webcam video stream and display it in the video element.
3. **Object Detection:** Load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js object detection model and integrate it to process each video frame, identifying the target object.
4. **Tracking Implementation:** Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., using centroid tracking) to follow the detected object's movement across frames. Update the tracking data on the canvas.
5. **UI Enhancements:** Refine the user interface to clearly display the video stream and the tracking information.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:** Real-time processing of video frames can be computationally intensive.  Careful model selection and optimization techniques (like reducing frame rate) might be needed.
- **Accuracy of Tracking:**  Simple tracking algorithms can be susceptible to occlusion or rapid movement. More robust algorithms may require more time to implement.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical application of TensorFlow.js for real-time object detection.**  This provides hands-on experience with a crucial deep learning library in a browser environment.
- **Understanding and implementation of WebRTC for real-time video streaming.**  This helps develop skills in real-time communication technologies.
