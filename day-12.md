# Mini-Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple, yet challenging, game AI using reinforcement learning (RL) within a limited timeframe.  The focus will be on rapid prototyping and observing the learning process, rather than creating a highly optimized or complex agent.  The chosen game will be a simplified version of a classic game to minimize development time.  The significance lies in demonstrating the power and ease of applying RL to a practical problem in a short timeframe.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow)
- Gym (OpenAI Gym or a custom environment)
- Jupyter Notebook (or similar IDE)


## Features & Requirements
- **Game Environment:** A simple, text-based or visually minimal game environment (e.g., simplified Snake, a 2D grid-based maze navigation).
- **RL Agent:** A basic RL agent (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA) trained to play the game.
- **Training Loop:**  A training loop that iteratively updates the agent's policy based on game outcomes.
- **Performance Measurement:**  Tracking of the agent's performance metrics (e.g., score, steps taken).
- **Visualization (optional):** Basic visualization of the agent's progress (e.g., plotting scores over time).

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a simple form of experience replay to improve training stability.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor) to optimize agent performance.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Design and implement a basic game environment using a suitable library (Gym or custom).
2. **Agent Implementation:** Choose an appropriate RL algorithm and implement the agent's logic (Q-learning recommended for simplicity).
3. **Training Loop Development:** Create a training loop that interacts with the environment, trains the agent, and logs performance metrics.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):**  Experiment with different hyperparameters to find optimal settings for the chosen RL algorithm.
5. **Visualization & Evaluation:**  Visualize the training progress and evaluate the final performance of the agent.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Reward Function Design:** Defining a suitable reward function that appropriately guides the agent's learning is crucial and can be challenging.  Carefully consider the desired agent behavior when designing the reward structure.
- **Overfitting:**  With limited training time, overfitting is a possibility.  Employing techniques like early stopping or regularization might be necessary if the agent starts to perform poorly on unseen game states.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., Q-learning, state-action space, reward functions).
- Practical experience in implementing and training a basic RL agent.  This includes experience with iterative development, debugging, and hyperparameter tuning.
