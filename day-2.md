# Real-time Object Detection & Tracking with WebRTC

## Overview
This project aims to build a real-time object detection and tracking system using a web camera and a browser-based interface, leveraging WebRTC for low-latency video streaming and a pre-trained object detection model. This demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and real-time communication technologies.  The significance lies in its potential for applications like remote monitoring, augmented reality experiences, and interactive video processing.


## Technologies & Tools
* **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with Node.js for backend if needed)
* **Framework/Library (Frontend):** TensorFlow.js or similar (e.g., ONNX.js) for object detection, WebRTC for video streaming.
* **Framework/Library (Backend - Optional):** Node.js with Express.js (if handling multiple clients or needing server-side processing).
* **Tools:**  A web camera, a code editor (VS Code recommended), a browser (Chrome preferred for WebRTC).
* **Pre-trained Model:**  A lightweight, pre-trained object detection model like MobileNet SSD or YOLOv5s.


## Features & Requirements
- **Real-time Video Streaming:**  Capture video from the webcam and stream it using WebRTC.
- **Object Detection:**  Perform real-time object detection on the streamed video using a pre-trained model.
- **Object Tracking:**  Track detected objects across frames, assigning unique IDs to maintain object continuity.
- **Visualization:** Display the video feed with bounding boxes and labels around detected objects.
- **FPS Display:**  Show the frames per second (FPS) to monitor performance.

**Advanced/Optional Features:**
- **Multiple Client Support:** (Backend required)  Allow multiple users to view the streamed video and object detection results simultaneously.
- **Custom Object Classes:**  Train or fine-tune the model to detect specific objects relevant to a particular use case.


## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the WebRTC Stream:** Integrate WebRTC to capture and stream the webcam feed to the browser.
2. **Load and Integrate the Object Detection Model:** Load a pre-trained model using TensorFlow.js or a similar library.  Ensure efficient inference within the browser's constraints.
3. **Implement Object Detection and Tracking:** Process each frame from the WebRTC stream, perform object detection, and implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., using centroid tracking).
4. **Visualize Results:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels onto the video feed, displaying object detection results.
5. **Optimize for Performance:**  Profile and optimize the code to achieve a reasonable FPS (at least 10-15 FPS) on a typical computer.


## Challenges & Considerations
- **Balancing performance and accuracy:** Lightweight models are preferable for real-time processing but might have lower accuracy.  Finding a suitable balance is key.
- **Browser compatibility:** Ensure cross-browser compatibility of the WebRTC implementation and the chosen object detection library.  Testing on different browsers is crucial.


## Learning Outcomes
- **Reinforce understanding of real-time video processing:** Gain practical experience in working with WebRTC and handling video streams efficiently.
- **Apply pre-trained models in a real-world scenario:**  Learn how to integrate and utilize pre-trained computer vision models within a web application.
