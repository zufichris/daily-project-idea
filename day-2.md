# Robotic Arm Calibration using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a simple calibration routine for a robotic arm using computer vision. The goal is to use a camera to locate known points in the arm's workspace and automatically adjust the robot's internal coordinate system to match the real-world environment. This is crucial for accurate and reliable robotic manipulation.  The project will focus on a simplified 2D calibration for a single degree of freedom (DOF) arm, allowing for a quick prototype.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- A robotic arm (even a simulated one is acceptable)
- A camera (webcam or similar)
- A chessboard or other pattern for feature detection

## Features & Requirements
- **Camera Calibration:** Calibrate the camera to determine its intrinsic parameters (focal length, distortion coefficients).
- **Target Detection:** Detect a known pattern (e.g., chessboard corners) in the camera image.
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Calculate the transformation between the camera coordinate system and the robot's base coordinate system using detected points.
- **Robot Arm Control:**  Send commands to the robotic arm to move to specific positions based on the calculated transformation.
- **Error Minimization:** Implement a basic iterative algorithm to refine the transformation based on the observed discrepancies between the commanded and actual positions.

- **Advanced Feature:** Implement a more robust error correction algorithm (e.g., least squares).
- **Advanced Feature:** Extend to a multi-DOF robotic arm.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Camera Calibration:** Use OpenCV's `calibrateCamera` function to calibrate the camera. Save the intrinsic parameters.
2. **Target Detection:** Detect the known pattern (e.g., chessboard corners) in the image using OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners`.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Use the detected points in the camera image and corresponding robot positions to estimate the transformation matrix (e.g., using OpenCV's `solvePnP`).
4. **Robot Arm Control:** Send commands to the robot to move to several test points. Compare the observed positions (via camera) to the commanded positions to evaluate accuracy.
5. **Iterative Refinement (Optional):**  If necessary, iteratively refine the transformation matrix based on the observed errors.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Accuracy of Robot Control:** The precision of the robot arm's movements will directly impact the calibration accuracy.  Using a simulated arm might help manage this initial challenge.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in lighting can affect the accuracy of feature detection. Careful lighting control (or robust algorithms dealing with lighting changes) will be important.


## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforced understanding of camera calibration techniques and coordinate transformations.
- Practical experience with integrating computer vision and robotics for control applications.
