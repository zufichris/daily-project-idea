# Minimax AI for a Simplified Board Game

## Overview

This project involves creating a Minimax AI agent to play a simplified version of a classic board game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four with a smaller board).  The goal is to develop a functional AI that can play optimally against a human player or another AI instance within a limited timeframe. This project focuses on implementing the core Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency.  The simplified game ensures feasibility within a day or two.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  `pygame` (for optional graphical interface), `numpy` (optional, for board representation)

## Features & Requirements

- **Minimax Algorithm Implementation:** The core functionality is to implement the Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move for the AI player.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Incorporate alpha-beta pruning to significantly improve the search efficiency of the Minimax algorithm.
- **Game Logic:**  Implement the game logic for the simplified board game (e.g., checking for wins, draws, valid moves).
- **Human Player Interaction:** Allow a human player to interact with the AI (via command line or a simple GUI).
- **AI vs. AI Gameplay (Optional):**  Allow two AI instances to play against each other to observe optimal gameplay.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Game Logic:** Define the game board, rules, and win/draw conditions for the simplified game.  Create functions to check for valid moves, determine the game state, and update the board.
2. **Minimax Function:** Implement the Minimax algorithm recursively.  This function should evaluate game states, explore possible moves, and return the best move for the AI.
3. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Integrate alpha-beta pruning into the Minimax function to reduce the number of nodes explored in the game tree.
4. **Player Interaction:**  Create a simple interface (command line or `pygame`) allowing a human player to make moves.
5. **Game Loop:** Combine all components to create a game loop that alternates between the human player and the AI.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Computational Complexity:**  For larger game boards, the search space can become very large.  Effectively implementing alpha-beta pruning is crucial to manage this.
- **Game State Representation:** Choosing an efficient data structure (e.g., NumPy array) for representing the game board will affect performance.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcement of AI Search Algorithms:** This project provides hands-on experience with implementing and optimizing the Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.
- **Game Development Fundamentals:**  This project touches upon core concepts in game development, including game logic, player interaction, and AI implementation.
