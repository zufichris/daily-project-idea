# TinyML-Based Gesture Recognition for Smart Home Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype for a gesture-based smart home control system using a low-power microcontroller and a TinyML model for real-time gesture recognition.  The system will use a small sensor (e.g., accelerometer or IMU) to capture gesture data, process it locally on the microcontroller using a pre-trained model, and trigger corresponding smart home actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting volume). This demonstrates the feasibility of edge-based AI for resource-constrained devices.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or similar (with integrated IMU).
* **Programming Language:** Arduino IDE (C++).
* **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow Lite Micro.
* **Sensor:** Onboard IMU of the chosen microcontroller.
* **Development Environment:**  Arduino IDE with TensorFlow Lite Micro libraries installed.


## Features & Requirements

- **Gesture Data Acquisition:**  Capture 3-axis accelerometer data from the IMU during user gestures.
- **Real-time Gesture Classification:**  Use a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite Micro model to classify the acquired data into predefined gestures (e.g., wave, swipe up/down).
- **Smart Home Control Integration:** Trigger predefined actions based on the classified gesture (e.g.,  wave to turn on lights, swipe up to increase volume).
- **Data Visualization (Optional):** Display the classified gesture on an LCD screen or send data to a serial monitor for debugging.
- **Model Deployment:** Successfully deploy a pre-trained model onto the microcontroller.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Collect accelerometer data for different gestures using the Arduino and preprocess it (e.g., filtering, normalization).  Utilize existing datasets or quickly gather a small dataset and train a very basic model for this proof-of-concept.
2. **Model Selection and Conversion:** Select a suitable pre-trained TinyML model (or train a very simple one) for gesture recognition and convert it to the TensorFlow Lite Micro format. Focus on a small and efficient model to fit within microcontroller constraints.
3. **Model Deployment and Integration:** Integrate the converted TensorFlow Lite Micro model into the Arduino sketch.
4. **Gesture Recognition and Action Triggering:**  Implement the gesture recognition logic using the deployed model and connect it to smart home control mechanisms (simulated actions for a quick prototype).
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system with various gestures and refine the model or data preprocessing steps as needed.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Accuracy and Size:** Balancing model accuracy with its size to fit within the microcontroller's memory constraints is crucial. Using a very simple model and a limited number of gestures is vital for a one-day prototype.
- **Real-time Processing:**  Ensuring the gesture recognition and action triggering happen in real-time requires careful optimization of the code and model.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical experience with TinyML:** Gain hands-on experience with deploying and integrating a machine learning model onto a resource-constrained microcontroller.
- **Embedded Systems Development:**  Reinforce skills in embedded systems programming, sensor integration, and real-time processing.
