# AI-Powered Image Caption Generator for Robot Navigation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of an AI-powered image caption generator specifically tailored for robot navigation.  The system will take an image from a robot's camera, process it using a pre-trained model, and generate a concise, action-oriented caption describing the scene for the robot's path planning algorithm. This addresses the challenge of enabling robots to "understand" their environment more effectively without relying solely on complex scene parsing.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning model inference), transformers (for natural language processing)
- **Pre-trained Model:** A suitable pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., from Hugging Face Model Hub)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE


## Features & Requirements

- **Image Acquisition:** Integrate with a simulated camera feed or use a pre-recorded dataset of images.
- **Image Caption Generation:**  Generate a concise caption describing the scene (e.g., "Clear path ahead," "Obstacle detected: box on the right," "Stairs ahead").
- **Caption Filtering & Refinement:**  Implement basic filtering to remove irrelevant details or noise from the captions.
- **Actionable Output:**  The generated caption should directly inform robot navigation decisions (e.g., via a simple API).
- **Logging & Visualization:** Log generated captions alongside input images for debugging and analysis.


- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Implement a simple feedback mechanism to allow correction of inaccurate captions, improving model performance over time.
- **Advanced Feature (Optional):** Integrate with a basic robot simulator to demonstrate real-time caption generation and its impact on robot movement.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup & Data:** Set up the Python environment, install necessary libraries, and load a pre-trained image captioning model.  Prepare a sample image dataset or simulated camera feed.
2. **Image Preprocessing:** Implement basic image preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization) to optimize model input.
3. **Caption Generation & Filtering:** Integrate the pre-trained model to generate captions and implement a basic filtering mechanism to remove noisy or irrelevant words.
4. **Actionable Output Formatting:** Structure the output captions into a format easily interpreted by a simple robot navigation algorithm (e.g., JSON with action commands).
5. **Testing & Evaluation:** Test the system with various images and evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated captions.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the pre-trained model may vary, requiring careful selection and potentially some fine-tuning.
- **Real-time Performance:** Achieving real-time caption generation may require optimization of the model inference process and careful consideration of image resolution.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforce understanding of deep learning models:** This project solidifies practical application of pre-trained models for specific tasks.
- **Develop skills in integrating different AI components:**  This project involves integrating image processing, natural language processing, and potentially robotic control modules, fostering interdisciplinary problem-solving skills.
