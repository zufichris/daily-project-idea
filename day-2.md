# Self-Balancing Robot Arm with PID Control

## Overview
This project aims to develop a miniature self-balancing robot arm using a single servo motor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The robot arm will maintain its upright position despite external disturbances, demonstrating a practical application of PID control algorithms.  The significance lies in showcasing real-time control and sensor integration in a compact and manageable system.

## Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**  PySerial (for serial communication), RPi.GPIO (if using a Raspberry Pi), a suitable IMU library (e.g., for MPU6050), a servo motor library (e.g., for the PCA9685 servo driver).
* **Hardware:**  A small servo motor, an IMU (e.g., MPU6050), a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico or Arduino Nano), a breadboard, jumper wires, a power supply.


## Features & Requirements

- **Self-Balancing:** The arm should maintain an upright position using feedback from the IMU.
- **PID Control Implementation:** A PID controller should be implemented to regulate the servo motor's position based on the IMU readings.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The program should read IMU data and adjust the servo motor in real-time.
- **Stable Equilibrium:** The arm should exhibit minimal oscillations and maintain balance effectively.
- **Data Visualization (Optional):**  Display IMU readings and servo motor angles graphically.

- **Advanced Feature 1:**  Implement a simple user interface (e.g., via a serial terminal) to control the arm's target angle.
- **Advanced Feature 2:** Introduce a small counterweight to increase the challenge of balancing.


## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the IMU, servo motor, and microcontroller according to the chosen hardware setup. Test all hardware components individually.
2. **IMU Calibration & Data Acquisition:** Calibrate the IMU to obtain accurate readings. Write code to continuously read and process IMU data (angle).
3. **PID Controller Implementation:**  Implement the PID algorithm in Python. Tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) iteratively to achieve optimal stability.
4. **Servo Motor Control:**  Write code to control the servo motor's angle based on the output of the PID controller. This will involve mapping the PID output to the servo's angle range.
5. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the system's performance and adjust the PID gains until satisfactory stability is achieved.


## Challenges & Considerations

- **PID Tuning:** Finding the optimal PID gains requires iterative adjustments and may be time-consuming.  Start with conservative gains and gradually increase them.
- **IMU Noise:** IMU readings are often noisy. Filtering techniques (e.g., moving average) may be necessary to improve accuracy and stability.


## Learning Outcomes

- **Reinforcing PID Control:** This project solidifies understanding of PID control implementation and tuning.
- **Practical Sensor Integration:** This project enhances practical experience in integrating sensor data (IMU) with actuators (servo motor) for real-time control systems.
